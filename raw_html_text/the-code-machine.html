                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TEAM NUMBER 44

                    </strong>
                    - When I was in middle school, my friends and I used to pass notes in school. And then we always used to use Caesar shifts and such because we thought we were "so cool". Knowing middle schoolers these days, they all have a fancy phone. This app is inspiration from my childhood, to help make the lives of modern middle school students a bit easier.

                    </strong>
                    - I've always had very overprotective parents, and they have gone through my phone before and grounded me for things they shouldn't have known about. If I had this app, I would have been able to avoid this torture.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a encryption and decryption app that takes in String inputs and mutates them and has the capabilities to change them back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Android Studio to develop this app. We also tested many of the java based algorithms in eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have ever made an app before, and neither of us have any experience with XML, so this was a huge step for us. We got lost and stuck a lot, but in the end, we were able to push through and let our ideas shine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to solve algorithms that we would have had problems with in the past. We are also proud of our ability to work with a programming language we have never used or even seen before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work under pressure and stay awake for unholy amounts of time. Not only did we learn how to code in a different language, but we learned how to teach ourselves to code in that language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Code Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we will be able to develop this app further to be able to encrypt in different and more complex ways, so that this app can be utilized in more sophisticated styles allowing the app to be more widely used for more applications in the direction of security.
