                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by working multiple jobs that are shift based and struggling to have a good way to cover shifts with coworkers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See your weekly schedule. 
If the worker needs to have the shift replaced, they put their shift into the shift marketplace and it can be covered by a coworker. Then the manager or supervisor can either approve or deny the shift replacement.

                    using a local server for our databases, lots of HTML, PHP and SQL statements for the implementation and CSS for its beauty.
