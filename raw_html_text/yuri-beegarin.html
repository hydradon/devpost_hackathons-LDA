                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend said Leap Motion was cool, so we decided to make a game with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Especially in space. But by using your right hand, you spawn gravitational nodes in the game which attract the bee.  You can use your left hand to rotate the bee and shoot venom at enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Leap Motion SDK &amp; Assets. Also Photoshop for custom sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of documentation for Leap Motion, inconsistencies within its SDK, version control between OSs because leap motion only really works on Windows, lack of time to implement all our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to deliver a game with a significant amount of mechanics and artwork.
