                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why can't investing be fun? Investing early on in one's career creates the opportunity for
                    <strong>
                        substantial
                    </strong>
                    financial growth over time.

                    Wellth educates users on the important health benefits of staying active and the financial benefits of investing early on. All with an easy-to-use interface that excites them with exciting games and simulations!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellth was built on the Processing Platform, utilizing the Java language to integrate the Withings API to collect health and wellness information and the Facebook Graph API to collect social information.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the APIs our team tried to integrate into our app were limiting the number of applicants they shared their APIs with. After testing out three different fitness APIs we came across Withings and were then able to integrate the fitness component of our app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that our team consists of two non-Computer Science majors, we are very proud of the work we were able to accomplish over this weekend. Our team members learned to program in Java and Swift in less than 24 hours, learned to program on the Swift platform, and worked with foreign APIs. The entire Hackathon was a major learning experience, but it was an enjoyable one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a GUI user interface, create a financial/wellness game by coding a particle simulator, and simulate extended medical longevity by practicing good habits early on in life.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wellth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellth is positioned to become
                    <strong>
                        the
                    </strong>
                    platform that helps users develop healthy habits. Wellth has the potential to partner with research institutions to establish another level of credibility in spreading the message of the importance of health and early investing. Wellth may gain the ability to send push notifications to users when they've started taking on habits that damage their health. Wellth users will be educated and excited to invest, and will do so as quickly and easily as Venmo users.
