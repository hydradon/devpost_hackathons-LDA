                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a service that makes it easier for music producers when they are just starting out. Current music editors have such big libraries of beats that it takes hours just to find one beat that you really like. With our app, it takes songs you like and finds beats based on those songs to suggest to you so you don't have to waste hours to find a beat you're into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the top tracks in your Spotify playlists in order to download beats that you would like so you can then make your own music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Docker, Flask, Microsoft Azure, Domain.com, and p5.js as the main components of our website. We were in the process of making an android app using Android Studio but we didn't have enough time to make a functioning app on top of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues getting the Spotify API to work properly. Eventually, we got that working but then we came to the issue of getting all the different HTML files into one cohesive file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot during this process and that's what we are proud of. We have 2 first-time hackers and 2 veteran-hackers on the team and we all learned valuable skills that we didn't know we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us learned that it's difficult in many aspects to incorporate different services from different platforms. We all took the challenge and did our absolute best to make the site we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Astro-licious #48
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to take this further and make a real app and full website with all the bells and whistles. Hopefully, we can make this a reality!
