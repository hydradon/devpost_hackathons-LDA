                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all felt the subtle panic when Google tells us "you are coughing because you have cancer". In attempt to eliminate that, we built a diagnosing software that is easily accessible, through Kik, and uses real medical records and ML to give a better diagnosis than a simple Google search.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receives text input of symptoms, processes it with NLP, and feeds it through an ML algorithm to output possible diagnosis and nearby medical locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python
kik
Firebase/Pyrebase
Google-place
Google-maps
Fuzzyset
Flask
Apimedic
Challenges I ran into
Apimedic API was hard to implement and we had to deal with a call time limit
Attempted to implement custom keyboard on Kik but had little time to finish
Accomplishments that I'm proud of
No team member knew all of the APIs we implemented but we were very efficient in on-site learning. Made a functional app in less than 12 hours
