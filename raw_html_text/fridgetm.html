                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was born one day before hackathon, so always excited to build something new
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to take snapshots of their products e.g (vegetables) and the system based on AI will fetch the snapshots and suggest the user some recipes he/she could prepare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite challenging only knowing PHP server side language, so relying on Google Vision API was a risk but, at the end the application proves to be useful and very funny.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into was relying on a third party trained machine API, which we weren't quite sure if it's going to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a little AI system which proves to be useful for those who rarely cook and would like to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to make use of Google Vision API and overcame lots of challenges regarding the app
                </p>

                    What's next for FridgeTM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on integrating our app with IoT devices and connect it to couple fridges
