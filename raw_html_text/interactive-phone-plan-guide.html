                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After listening to the presentation about Metro's phone plans and add-ons, I could tell that the same speech is given at least ten times a day in each of the thousands of Metro stores across the nation. So I decided to come up with a way to scale up this presentation in a consistent and enjoyable way to new customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Metro assistant is a virtual assistant that guides customers in deciding the right phone plan for them. This is all done in a very natural setting that puts customers at ease.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Metro Assistant using a series of 3D animation tools that I had never used before. I also had to code in c# to get certain aspects of the Assistant working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to 3D animations, I was hit with a huge learning curve that I was not expecting. Despite this, I persevered and surprisingly enjoyed the journey it took me on.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that this concept will not only benefit Metro but a lot of industries. I was afraid of not having a good concept but once I came up with Metro Assistant, I knew I was onto something big.
                </p>

                    Perseverance and hard work can get you anywhere

                    What's next for Metro Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue to improve on this concept and hope to see it bear fruit in the near future
