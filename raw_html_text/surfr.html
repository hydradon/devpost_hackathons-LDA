                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's like meeting new people by traveling the world, except you're surfing the internet from the comfort of your home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it just logs everyone's web history into a shared database and displays it in a chrome extension pop-up. Basically, a glorified web history viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase to connect all the users to a database. Chrome extension APIs to do the heavy lifting in HTML and Javascript. I plan on adding Facebook login API in the future, to identify users and connect friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome extensions' security settings, Facebook authentication, and in general having to learn (or re-learn, in the case of jQuery) all these technologies from scratch and for the most part working on this project alone with no help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming comfortable with the tools I used in preparation of future projects, i.e., learning how to make chrome extensions, use Firebase, and integrate Facebook API from no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great deal of in-depth knowledge, capabilities, and interactions between the various Chrome extension functionalities. Synchronous and asynchronous database requests, thanks to the abstraction provided by Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Surfr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding Facebook API, maximizing security, and creating appeal for the average user in the target audience.
