                    This was our first time creating a video game or using a graphics user interface, so we wanted to created a game with very basic mechanics. We distorted a standard spaceship shooting game by adding real images of ourselves and LHS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You shoot stars from a larger star to defeat the students trying to enter the school. They get faster and faster as the levels get higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java swing and photoshop, featuring some tutorials for using the graphics user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have never used a graphics interface before, so we had a lot of trouble trying to understand what areas of the code we could edit to fit our game, such as adding levels, importing images, adding a timer, and many other key aspects of a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the simple reactive animation we added with the star changing color when firing a missile. We are also proud of making the students bounce off the edges of the window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about animating objects, java swing, and creating multi-class projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope to have animate walk cycles for the students and create a more diverse game experience.
