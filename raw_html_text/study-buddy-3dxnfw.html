                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever find yourself cramming for a test the night before and not understanding a single thing from your notes, textbooks, or homework solutions?  Wouldn't it be easier to have someone from your class studying for the same test help explain those concepts?  Throughout our college career, there have been many times where we were taking classes that we needed help in, but had no friends that we knew in the same class.  Having a way to reach out to those classmates who are also looking for help through a mobile application can help break the ice between students to form study groups and grow their network.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Study Buddy provides students the opportunity to reach out to nearby students who are looking to get a study buddy or join a study group for their classes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first started off by identifying one of the biggest problems we face in college and built an app around that. Once the concept and requirements were laid out along with the most appropriate tools needed to develop them. We decided that the ionic framework was a good option to build a web application that had the key features and UI components needed to develop a high quality project. We utilized each member's strongest skills to develop the project in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges facing the group was familiarizing ourselves with technologies we have not used before. Installing the ionic framework was not straightforward because it was done through command line. Deciding which new APIs to implement also proved to be a challenge due to unclear documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing the project progress incrementally was an interesting experience. We were able to implement most of our intended features by the deadline and we learned how to better cope with the challenges that arose during the process. Meeting someone new and working with them can also be challenging at times, but we managed to collaborate seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a variety of things during this hackathon. First was our ability to find our solutions quickly using the help of teammates or the internet. Second was our ability to learn and implement new APIs. Lastly, we acquired a better sense of responsibility and taking initiative in a team environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The foundation of Study Buddy allows for it to have the potential to establish more than just friendships and study groups.  With additional time to fully develop the application, a rating system would be implemented to endorse the skill set of individuals in study groups.  After receiving a certain number of endorsements, the individual would be eligible to become a tutor for that subject or concept.  This would not only foster the growth of a collaborative environment in which students would work in, but would also provide benefits to those students who master the concepts in their classes.
