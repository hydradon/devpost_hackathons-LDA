                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this website because we realized that all students have things we are struggling with. Some students have bad teachers or are just confused by the material. We thought that if we could create a forum where students can converse about school subjects together we could eliminate some of that confusion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an online forum for students, that will allow high schoolers around the world to converse about their classes and help each other succeed. It will also provide the students with practice problems, as well as help on writing essays. These resources will include essay templates, in addition to practical templates like resum&eacute;s. We plan to provide resources and links to cheap textbooks as well as sites like Sparknotes and Khan Academy. In addition, older students will be able to provide advice for others regarding college and life in general.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used sublime in order to create our website.

                <p>
                    We all had extremely limited coding knowledge so it was hard to put all of our ideas for the website into reality.

                    We succeeded in creating a working website for our idea.
