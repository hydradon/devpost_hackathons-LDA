                <p>
                    RapidServe is a mobile application which allows restaurants to charge
their customers through a mobile application interface. Powered
with a React Native frontend and Python Flask API server with a
mongoDB database, RapidServe uses QR codes linked to tables to
allow the customer to scan the QR code at their table and pay for
any item at their table. Once all the items at the customers table
are paid for, the customer is free to go and the waiter/waitress
does not need to be bothered and wait for each customer at a
table to pay individually.
                </p>

                                The frontend was implemented using React Native, there is a 
landing page where the user can register or log in, using a
facebook integration to link their facebook account.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While creating an account, if the user is a waiter/waitress, they are prompted
to enter their restaurant ID, along with entering their username/password
combination. If the user is a customer, they will just be prompted for
a username/password combination.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The page which comes up next is a page to scan a QR code which corresponds
to the table which the waiter/waitress is serving or the customer is sitting at,
the customer will be able to see which items have been charged to their table
and pay for whichever items they need to. The waiter/waitress will be allowed
to add items to the table they are serving.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The user can pay for their items and the waiter/waitress can see if the table
has been paid for and know the customers are good to go.

make their HTTP requests,

this API document was the contract between the frontend and the backend in
terms of what arguments were sent into what type of HTTP requests. The API
was hosted on a virtual machine in the cloud.
