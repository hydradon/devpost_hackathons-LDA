                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us wanted to get experience developing a video game and wanted the game we made to be fresh. Making a cross platform PC-Android multiplayer game was not something we had heard a lot about so we knew it would be a cool adventure and an intriguing way to learn about multiplayer functionality in the Unity Engine.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    !Skyrim is a team vs one game where a group of players attempt to traverse through a level to get to a finish line. While on their way towards their destination, one player, the god of the game, will be able to throw obstacles at them to impede their progress. The team will be playing on PCs, while the god will play on android device.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build everything entirely on Unity from the network to the android application. We found a lot of information online about Unity, so used that information to help us create the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with multiplayer, so it was challenging creating a new multiplayer game. Not only that, we all barely had any Unity experience so we had to take everything from the beginning. For some issues with the hack, we ran into many problems with the network. Our troubles first started with connecting at least two people together using the host/server-client method in Unity. After we were able to finish the client-server model, we hit another bump when we had to sync objects created on one client or server with all the other clients and server. We tried function after function, package after package, until we finally found a solution.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easily our biggest accomplish for hack is the integration between the android player and the PC/Mac players. We were amazed to see when we tried out our game on mobile that we were even able to play with PC/Mac users. From the mobile and PC/Mac controls to the layout of the game and UI, we are proud of how we designed the game.
