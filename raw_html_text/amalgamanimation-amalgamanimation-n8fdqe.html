                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Funny animations and memes, just wanting make a funny animation since none of us can really code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This animation is simply meant for fun. To be entertainment. For both us, and others who watch it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do not have any animation software so everything was drawn frame by frame in a single canvas on multiple layers to act as the frames. We then used a video editing software to compile all of the images together into an animation. We all have different styles of art and we put them to use doing so. We all made different animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animating some things and some technical difficulties. Since I'm the only one who has the drawing tablet and the main computer this animation was occurring on, when the tablet wouldn't work, this created some trouble. But the problem was solved and we carried on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaborating and creating animations with my friends. I always liked to make little stories. Thanks to my friends, we brought some stories to life on a screen. Wether they were funny or a bit weird, it was a fun experience altogether.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about animation and how to do it with what I have. An animator doesn't need all of this fancy software and expensive equipment to create an animation.

                    What's next for Amalgamanimation (AmalgamAnimation)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly another animation. If we have the motivation and time to do so. Though this was fun, it was also very draining.
