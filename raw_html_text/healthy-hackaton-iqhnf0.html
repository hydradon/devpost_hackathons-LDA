                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While being at a hackaton surrounded by free food and drinks, I have realised how unhealthy our choices are when we have this opportunity of unlimited junk food. It is very important to be conscious that even though we are getting stronger and stronger in Computer Science, a human being will remain a human being and we need to take care of the interface and code of ourselves as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program prints the number of calories you should eat during the hours you stay up in the night extra from your usual sleep outside a hackaton. It transforms that number into the number of redbulls or slices of pizza those calories represent. It then gives you some relative information and afterwards it prints a menu from which the user can have different options about healthy life.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python and the Twilio API. The entire program is based on SMS twilio messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My whole team left me after a few hours and I developed the entire application by myself. As a first year of computer science, I had to research every move I made and work 10 times harder than other times, especially because I was alone. I also had great difficulties when I started developing the application in Java, but then I changed to Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I have managed to build my own functional application that might change the way programmers think about themselves. I am also proud that the app is functional, and can be used right now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything I have done was new for me, so I learned how to use Python in depth and how to tackle the TWILIO API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Healthy Hackaton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will keep developing the application towards a better start GUI by using Flask.
