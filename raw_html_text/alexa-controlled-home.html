                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore the possibilities of an Amazon Alexa along with a Photon chip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's like a smart home, but without smart devices!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commands include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa, trigger turn [on/off] light
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa, trigger turn [on/off] [red/green/blue/party] light
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alexa, trigger turn [on/off] fan
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created Alexa skills to send inputs to the Particle.io/Photon chip to allow us to simulate turning on lights from a far. We also had a RGB light that could be used to set the mood and we could turn on and off a fan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS and Alexa skill dev kit were hard to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a cool "party" RGB mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with Alexa.
                </p>
