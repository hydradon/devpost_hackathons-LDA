                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of improving the health of a country by connecting sick people with big, unwieldy institutions like the government (we all know how complicated health care is), we envisioned a grassroots movement that leverages the charity of people for their community. The idea here is that a little goes a long way (donations can be around $10-20, about what a deductible is equal to)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine if you were a low-income mother living on food stamps. Why would you bother seeing a doctor about a health issue knowing that you most likely can&rsquo;t afford it? And imagine if you wanted to donate money to a charitable cause, but don&rsquo;t know how much of a difference it&rsquo;s actually making. Connecting these two populations would yield tremendous benefits because it&rsquo;s a win-win for both sides. Our project provides a viable solution to this problem in simple steps:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.Benefactors have the chance to pay-it-forward during their hospital visit or online by donating money in addition to the deductible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.Lower-income patients use our app to locate hospitals with pay-it-forward funds and book an appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.They show up and provide their SSN to the doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.The doctor uses our website to verify that they qualify for free coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.Doctor THEN offers appropriate care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have also added a feature of sentiment analysis which will help schizophrenia patients and others to send their data to the doctor without the need to visit the doctor every day. This will help the homeless by saving on transportation cost and would also help the doctor in keeping a check on the patient based on their everyday sentiment analysis report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we implemented an SOS function by which the entire community of our app, that is the people in the vicinity will all be informed and updated with the geolocation of the person who would press the SOS button in the application. Thus expecting community-based help to reach the victim before 911 arrives.

                    1.Filter hospitals based on the type of aid they offer, since some hospitals may not have or resources for specific health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.Integrate the TensorFlow textsum library to summarize medical documents for the less-educated or non-native English speakers.

                <p>
                    3.Carpool option if an incoming patient sees that a low-income patient in their area has booked an appointment around the same time or soon after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.Kiosks near subway/metro stop for booking appointments for those without access to computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.General Location Donation (GLD): in the app select a zip code to donate to, then an algorithm would dole out the donation to the hospitals in that zip code that needs it.
