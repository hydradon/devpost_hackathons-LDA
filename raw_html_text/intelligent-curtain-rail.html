                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was too bright outside while we were sleeping and we were too lazy to get up and close the curtain. So, we came up a idea of a intelligent curtain that could control by Arduino sensors and cellphone APP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It could control the curtain with multiple Arduino sensors such as the Ultrasonic sensor (to let people use hand distance to control the close level of curtain), the PIR sensor (to let user close and open the curtain with single hand wave), and the Bluetooth module (to trans the data information from cellphone app to the Arduino let user to control the curtain with screen slide.  It contained with 2 servo motor to control the rail of the curtain which gathering the signal from sensors and Bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, Calibrate all the sensors. For PIR sensor the original effective angle is 145 degrees, so we built a physical barrier to shrink the detective angle down to 30 degrees. For the Ultrasonic sensor, we use SMA algorithm to filter the value of the output distance. We also setup upper and lower thresholds to filter the extreme value. 
Second, we adjust the curtain rail position by adjusting the angle of position for the servo motor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would the first time for our team to use Arduino and make a Android App. So, it need to spend lots of times on learning and find the best sensors that we need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Arduino in a effition way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Intelligent curtain rail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future of the Intelligent curtain rail, we will focus on Android App development that could have a better UI systems and we could change the curtain material to polarizer filters that could let user to change the light intensity that could pass though the curtain.
