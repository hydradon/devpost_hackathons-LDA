                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to write code and listen my favorite music on Spotify. 
I hope my app will help to collaborate with your team while you are coding. Developers need to have opportunity not only to share there code using GitHub extension for Teams,
but also playlists. I hope my app for Teams will help to build great positive atmosphere,  especially after Teams became available for free for everyone and not only for developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        you can choose music on Spotify and share it with your Team
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        you can create playlists for your Team
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        share feedback about track
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is much more fun to create, inspire, innovate, write code listening your favorite music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just imagine that you can create your team playlist, organize hackathon, create Teams channel for collaboration and play music that you all agree on or you choose for your team at the beginning of your event, during coding and celebrating with your teammates using Spotify on Microsoft Teams on Cortana or Alexa device.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used TypeScript, nodejs, msteams-ui-components-react and Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authorization part wasn't clear at the beginning, I tried several scenarios. I am glad to see Authorization card and I hope that they will be available soon for my scenario too. Rate limiting for spotify sdk is too harsh.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned to to build bots, tabs, and publish apps to Microsoft Teams.

                    Add bot support, add more functionality.
