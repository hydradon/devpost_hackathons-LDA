                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was brainstorming on our personal issues with the education system as it is, and we realized that almost none of us were pursuing the careers we'd studied for most of college. We thought about why we ended up pursuing fields other than the ones we studied in, and realized that part of it had to do with the obscurity of the path that had been shown to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects students with companies and lets them know exactly what skills and qualifications companies are looking for.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of teamwork and very little sleep.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to focus when you're sleep deprived, even as students.
