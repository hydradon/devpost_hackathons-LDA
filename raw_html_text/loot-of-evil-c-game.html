                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put our love for RPG video games and decided to create a story of our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puts the user in state of suspense as they realize that the choices they make affect their outcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Visual Studio 2017, it was coded from an empty project, after plotting the story for hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a storyline that flowed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we made an old fashioned text-based RPG.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code under pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Loot of Evil C++ Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A deeper story, a change from text-based to 2D, and then 3D.
Then the release of a mobile application, Steam video game.
