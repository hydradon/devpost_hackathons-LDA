                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students complain about being forced to log in to my.ucla.edu every time to check their schedule and having to go through the multi-factor authentication each time, or look up the photo they took two months ago to check what class they have next. It also takes a significant amount of time to transfer your classes into a calendar manually, and having an app do it for you would be more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Study List Exporter exports a study list ...
from a student's study list to Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a complex web extension which uses regular expressions to scrape data from my.ucla.edu
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble when trying to work around the security restrictions put in place through Google Chrome. We also had trouble figuring out how to implement the classes into a calendar after deriving the text from the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using regular expressions to extract information from the Study List and also being able to work around the security restrictions from Google Chrome when creating the web extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to get past the security restrictions from Google Chrome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Publishing it into Google Chrome Extensions and coming up with a better name.
