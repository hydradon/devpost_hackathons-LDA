                <p>
                    Organizing group activities gets really complicated when you factor in payment and budgeting for your own activities. We made CashMe to

                <p>
                    CashMe uses the Nessie API to manage your budget. You can deposit money to your account

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built out iOS app using Swift and xCode. We used the Nessie API to get mock user data and to post deposits.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble figuring out the Nessie REST API because it was different from what we had expected and seen with previous APIs. In order to use the REST API, we used AlamoFire and SwiftyJSON. We also used firebase as our back end to store groups, group data and user data. We used the charts API to create the analysis chart.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully interfacing with a REST API and processing JSON data using Swift. We are also proud of the chart that we generated.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a REST API using Swift.

                    What's next for CashMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would add a functionality to connect activities to a merchant and directly pay them from the app when an amount is promised. For example, when buying movie tickets from Fandango, the funds reserved for a group would go directly to the purchase of the tickets from Fandango. Additionally, we would like to connect it to an actual bank API instead of Nessie, which is made specifically for hacakathons.
