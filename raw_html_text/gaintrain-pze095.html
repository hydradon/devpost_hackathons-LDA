                <p>
                    All aboard the Gain Train
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the deal, I've used a lot of workout apps in the past that allow you to track what you do, but none of them were quite perfect. I figured "Hey, I'm a CS major at GaTech, might as well make my own!" And thus the gain train was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideas were simple: do what all the workout apps do well, but add in every feature that I've wanted, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Linking a spotify playlist to a workout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Competition with friends!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Streak" of consecutive days worked out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Custom reminder of how hard the last workout was
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to challenge a friend to a "competition"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But as all plans go, this was too ambitious and this did not get anywhere close to finished. Firebase was a confusing beast that took too long to figure out. Maybe next time!

                    This submission is very unfinished, but I thought it'd be fun to attempt it, so I'm submitting it just for fun!
