                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all come from immigrant family and we all understand the difficulty of learning a new language from different platforms (school, websites) and we wanted to create something that integrates our love for learning and the difficulty of learning a new language. Thus, we created LearnViro that combines the two by a self-directed learning path of your choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google API's to scan an object, determine what it is and translate it into the language you plan on learning (we only have Spanish), then it creates a mini quiz type based on the word of the object you scanned. Then you would need to choose the correct answer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made our own server and used the following Google API's; Vision API and Translate API. Then we used the dictionary API to translate the object into Spanish and then sends it to the app on Android.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We successfully integrated the dictionary API and translate API into our Android app
