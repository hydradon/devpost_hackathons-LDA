                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used HTML and CSS to hardcode the website, and linked it using flask.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We have little experience in using HTML, and thus we aren't sure how the functions work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We got a drop down button. Also that we hardcoded a presentable website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned about flask, block chains, and databases.
