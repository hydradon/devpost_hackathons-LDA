                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever felt like you just can&rsquo;t choose the music to fit your mood? Sometimes you play something too energetic right before going to sleep, so you end up staying up all night, binge watch series, finally take a pill, sleep in, miss the meeting with CEO, get fired. 
Or vice versa, you start your happy &amp; sunny day with Adele, remember your ex, start missing her/him, dump your current significant other and then realise you have no place to stay at so you go back to your mom&rsquo;s house. Yeah, these moments suck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bulbul plays the right music at the right moment. 
We know user&rsquo;s mood, activity level, wake up time, falling asleep time and so on. We also know user&rsquo;s musical preferences, for some people happy music means christian heavy metal and to others it means Texas country music. So with all that awesome data, user just has to press Play. No more inner battles over what to listen.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, we started with brainstorming for ideas as we came here empty-handed. When we got the idea, we started working on it. We came up with the name and the story, made the logo, started designing and implementing the product.
