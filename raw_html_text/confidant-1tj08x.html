                <p>
                    Millions of people face anxiety daily when dealing with regular social interactions. Especially in today&rsquo;s tech-driven society, social interaction has been at an all-time low, due to the increasing importance of screen interactions. However, it's difficult and time-consuming to overcome anxiety with current conventional practices. Furthermore, there currently aren't any defined and effective ways to practice social interaction.

                    We used cutting-edge libraries with limited documentation and unrefined code. It was quite a challenge to get a working prototype with them. Furthermore, due to how state-of-the-art our technology is, we had to work with unpolished academic paper code, taken straight from the most recent academic research.
