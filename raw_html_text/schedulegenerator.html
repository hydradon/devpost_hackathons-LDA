                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schools may have trouble creating schedules for all of their students without any conflictions, especially big high schools and colleges. This program solves this problem efficiently and easily creates new nonconflicting schedules for many students at a time.
Prevents future requests to changes to schedules and reduces mistakes. 
It's easy to alter the code to fit different classes and populations. 
Makes everyone happy!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes it easier for students to create schedules for themselves and for teachers to mass produce schedules for their students rather than creating them one by one. This is especially useful for schools with an exceptionally large amount of students.
Guidance counselors are usually packed during the beginning of new school years, and this program helps lessen their load by making sure students are placed into their desired classes (the first time).
