                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I said there are many challenges but with the power of youtube and my teacher i was somewhat able to produce an end product
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that i managed to finish this even though I just started learning the language needed for the project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>

                </h2>

                    I will continue the project in my spare time because I am not satisfied at the outcome
