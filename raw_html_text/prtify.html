                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When at a party, everyone wants to play their favorite songs but usually don't get a chance to. Prtify lets people to vote for the songs in the queue and plays the top most songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can join a party as a room and add songs to the queue. They can either Up vote or Down vote songs and Prtify plays the songs based on votes. The host also gets to choose the one of the spotify connected devices from which the song needs to be played.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We used SpotifyAPI, last.fmAPI, materialize, jQuery and Firebase.
