                    My Inspiration: I had been mugged not to long ago. All I could think of is how to get away from that area or take a new route to get to my destination. This made me think of how we can have travel safer in any time of day without being harmed or worried.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How It Works: This application is supposed to make the community safer when traveling. There are people in this world and community that need to get to work or get to some destination  safely. Statistics has shown that people get mugged and robbed. Me myself had trouble getting to my destination and I had gotten robbed. Ever since then I have been watching which ways I go so I would not run into Gang Affiliations. This app is to help people reach their destination safely. With this app, people will be more safer, and know who is around them. You put trust into your community and you do not worry about any of this gang affiliation. When a incident like this occurs, you feel unsafe and do not want to travel anywhere again. There are alternate ways to travel around. The Red circles are where there are Gang activities, The green circles are safe zones, you are able to walk without worrying. The blue spots are where there are authorities like school safety, or Police that can help you. This app will not only benefit teenagers, it will benefit all ages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am proud of making this applications with mire than one API. I used Google Maps and live Chat Rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was most difficult to build: The most difficult thing to build was the google maps. It was hard trying to get it online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned: i learned that being part of team that has similar skills as you is very helping. Great minds think a like and when they come together we can accomplish something amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for GangBusters: The next thing for this applications is more edits, add more things to make it more accurate and efficient.
