                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to create an app to learn more about android studio while having some fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two apps, one records and outputs anything the use says in the mic. The second displays the use how loud their environment is in decibels.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the microphone to respond properly and creating the right equation to get decibels since the mic simply outputs random numbers.
                </p>
