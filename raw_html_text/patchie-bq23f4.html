                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was inspired by a Ted Talk speaker: David Eagleman who talked about creating new senses for humans
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patchie receives data from some external source, be it a microphone, sime text data, or even data from a far off weather station - the sky is the limit. Our prototype is an extremely watered down version where it reads text data and maps it to 8 outputs which could then easily be read onto the skin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino as the base for the prototype. We programmed it to receive serial data and mapped its ASCII values to the 8 bit output. After training with the interface for a certain amount of time, it becomes almost natural to understand any information sent over the connection.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The phase 1 prototype output is LEDs, but when trying to switch output to the harmless electrical shocks we do not have the right material to work on.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Chris, I learned binary and hexadecimal conversion from decimals, and tiny bit C++ coding.
For Steve, I learned the basics of an inverter circuit for DC-AC-DC step up conversion.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about power systems in high voltage circuitry as well as designing a product that can be expanded much more in future builds.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Patchie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patchie is in its earliest state. Addition of a high voltage source and electrodes to replace the LED fixture, then moving towards smaller and more focused hardware to make the device more ergonomic. Adding a wireless link will also be necessary.
