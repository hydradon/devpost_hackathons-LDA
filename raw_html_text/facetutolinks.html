                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it is really hard to search for a good tutorial on a specific language or technology. So we thought that  that it will be easy and friendly if we provide a bot that developers was them beginners or experienced that need some resouces to have high quality tutorials and with less effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The facetutobots is a Facebook messenger bot that gather best quality tutorial on the web and give the possibility to developers to just say what the want and the bot give the the list of top tutorial about the desire Facebook technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facetutolinks is build using Facebook messenger platform and it is implement using nodejs, mongodb for the database and i host it on heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important challenge i ran into was to understand how the bot works that said technically because as a coder we need to understand how to program it and. Understanding it took me some time before i was able to begin with the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have build the bot and understand what is is all about and most importantly the power that lies behind it, what we can accomplish with the bot that ran on facebook for example users acquisition, raise awareness, grow a business etc.. all of this because we are targeting people where they are already. As a developer, i have feel the pain that it is to make people download an app and since i know this each of my app has an api that a bot will consume in other to scale easily and require less marketing effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the bot i learned a lot, first learned to build an efficient bot, learn new technology like nodejs with what i was not too familiar with, best practices, i learned more about the Facebook ecosystem and i loved wit.ai which is simply the best to add AI facilities to my bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facetutolinks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I intend to make Facetutolinks a platform running on facebook where developers can have any type of tutorial the want. This will be done by gathering best tutorial links so that they don't need to worry again much because we have done it for them. Also adding efficient AI capabilities to the bot.
