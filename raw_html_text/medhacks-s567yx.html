                    Many people have to take extreme caution in terms of their surroundings - from where they walk, to even where they breathe, for the slightest thing could set off an allergic reaction. Pain, fear and embarrassment easily could follow. But with the help of Ayo Akala, Duncan Woodbury, Nick Haltmeyer, and a mentor: FiiFi. We were able to make an app that keeps those with this and many other afflictions safe and out of harms way.

                    AllerGAlert is an android based application that notifies users if they are in an area with high amounts of air particulates, or pollen. If so then a multitude of pharmacies and hospitals will populate on the map showing them where they can get treatment and medical assistance.
