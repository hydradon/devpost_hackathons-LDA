                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the censorship resistant nature of both Ethereum &amp; IPFS, as well as the desire to promote the prevailing of the truth when it concerns the wellbeing of the human civilization, regardless of who objects to this notion based on corporate or elitist interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    leak0x provides a basic user interface which allows whistleblowers to easily distribute information in a censorship resistant way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    leak0x makes use of Ethereum to store mappings of IPFS hashes to Ethereum accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to us being new to the space, the entire application was a challenge. However, if we had to pick one thing, we had the most trouble with properly encoding and decoding IPFS files, in a way that made it easy to download them from the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Winning an award from NuCypher for the project &amp; having a functional project that enables users to easily commit and retrieve data from IPFS in conjunction with the Ethereum blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to handle data encoding and decoding in the context of IPFS, we learned how to use Formik, we improved our Solidity skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for leak0x
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved UI, adding a token curated registry, commenting capacity, whistleblower pseudonyms, reputation systems, NuCypher integration &amp; potentially a way to securely introduce a "journalist clearing house".
