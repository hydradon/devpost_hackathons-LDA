                    For many members of our team, this was our first experience with web development. We learned how to build React components, style our webpages using CSS, and handle forms/navigation using JavaScript.

                        Forums: We would like to provide a safe place for mothers to discuss their experiences with pregnancy. This community will help new mothers and mothers with low education feel included and in control of their health. It would also have a verified feature for professionals to post answers with marked credibility.
