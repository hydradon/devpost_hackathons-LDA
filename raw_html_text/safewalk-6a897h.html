                <p>
                    Have you ever walked home from somewhere a little unsafe and felt scared? Well this app aimed to make the user feel safe when walking home from a place they are not familiar with during any time of the day.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the the app is enabled, and the code word is said. The app automatically yet discretely call the Toronto Police. When the code word is said, the app starts recording what is happening around the victim and sends the location of the caller at that moment as well.
