                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenge description and our courses we had last week.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It processes .fastq files from genetic analysis of hospital rooms and gives threat level in these rooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had the idea of a pipeline that we could scale up. So we thought we could use some of our knowledge of cloud computing to bring that scalability. So we first looked at the available tools to analyse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between nodejs and the docker engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have build from scratch our first working prototype for our first hackaton.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about genetic data processing and scalability of applications.
