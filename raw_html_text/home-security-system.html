                <h2>
                    The inspiration came from the small amount of hardware we brought and acknowledging that we wanted to build something physical.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An ultrasonic distance sensor checks distance is in range, and if not sends push notification to a phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have different ways to run our system. The preferred method is by Particle Photon and external battery. This meets the qualifications as an IOT device. Alternatively, the device can be ran from a Raspberry Pi 3 through SSH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning front end and back end languages such as HTML and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As new Hackathoner's, we are proud to have a project to submit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all enjoyed the presentations, specifically the Web Apps and Machine Learning.  While hacking, the importance of front end development was brought to our attention, as well as understanding what an IOT device is and basic circuitry.

                    What's next for Home Security System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A housing, so the unit can be robust and functional for further development.
