                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I were inspired to do the game so people could play proper challenging AI without having the need of other people to have an intense gaming session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of the game is to make AI far more advanced than other games and account for factors such as the user, the computer's environment, and random probability (the computer can't be unbeatable).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Blender for 3D models and Unity (a game engine) to code the scripts for the AI and the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had was making the computer avoid the environment around it, because it had to check every time for an obstacle and move around it with precise calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the AI interact with the user as flawlessly as currently possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more advanced coding and 3D modeling.
                </p>

                    Updates to improve AI further and models more.
