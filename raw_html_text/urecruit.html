                    Our project is a mobile app that facilitates with student recruitment.  Enrollment of incoming Freshman at UMSL has been declining in recent years.  This app will make it easier for faculty to connect with interested students.  This personal touch will help encourage more admitted students to ultimately enroll.

                    How to use the App:
1) Prospective students who have interest in a specific academic area will be assigned to a faculty member in that department.  When assigned the student will show up in the faculty member's contact list.  The home page of the app has 3 tabs: Priority - for new students &amp; students that need addional contact, Ongoing - A list of all students current assigned to faculty member, Completed - Students that have enrolled, but still may require follow-up.

                    2) Clicking on the student's name on the home page, brings you to the student's profile page. On the profile page, there are 3 accordian tabs: Steps, About and History. The Steps tab has check boxes for different activities in the recruitment process. The About tab includes the student's contact information, graduation year, areas of interest and other important information. The History tab lists previous contacts with the student. At the top of this page is a progress bar that will let the user know at a glance how far the student is in the admissions process.
