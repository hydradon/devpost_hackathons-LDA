                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would help people who have issues with their hands write text on computers easily
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tracks a person's nose or any part of the individual's body, and it tracks it to control the mouse. This then writes on our own custom made draw program which directly saves every file that is written, and this is sent to interpreter code we wrote with AI learning in jupyter. This would then analyze the image and figure out what characters were in it, and then this was outputted out as a string value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to create our custom "Paint" program and we used jupyter to create the analyzing and learning program, which had Python as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a whole paint program from scratch and we had to understand machine learning to be able to do the artificial intelligence part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually did everything that we wanted to do including creating a whole new Paint program and learning and successfully implementing deep learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several machine learning techniques and how to create different aspects of a Paint canvas.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hands-Free Text Writer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to improve the accuracy of the analysis and see if we can get it out there.
