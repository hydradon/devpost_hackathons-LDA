                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea about two years ago and made it better through a few different prototypes. I thought it was ready to become a real website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When listening to music, you can open the website on a phone and "dance" via a music visualizer. You can easily  stream to another device to display your ColorDJ-ing.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a navigation framework in javascript using hidden divs as pages. I used node.js to host the website on heroku and set up peerjs for peer to peer connections with minimal latency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS is a major pain to develop for. Especially without a device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first website that I have ever had hosted and with it's own domain name.
I have wanted to use this version many times, and I am glad I can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I affirmed that I love software development! I also created my first (basic) web server.
                </p>

                    What's next for ColorDJ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    living at colordj.me, streaming on projectors alongside music DJs, additional effects to help teach new users effective technique.
