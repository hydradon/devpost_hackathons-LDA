                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary inspiration was constraint. We had originally planned something else, that would've required input from a device. After unsuccessful attempts to acquire the necessary hardware, we decided to make something brand new - REMember.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    REMember is a psychological machine-learning VR game where the player simply has to navigate left or right with the headset. The app tracks the player's decisions, and attempts to make the game more difficult for the player by offering choices based on the player's previous choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app largely through Unity3d and Visual Studio, splitting work between each of the members. Two people worked on code and concept at a time, and the other worked on assets in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitting the algorithm into a game engine, working with colliders, trying to make it optimized enough for mobile phones to run in VR mode,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Great algorithm, integration of randomization + logic, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enhanced our understanding of animation and the connection between coding and modelling in 3D. We also learned the importance of being prepared with a back up plan or two, since we had spent much of our time pivoting and brainstorming ideas once our original ones were constrained by hardware and time limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for REMember
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphical improvements, optimization of code and movement, enhanced machine-learning, and possible other uses such as flash cards for education.
