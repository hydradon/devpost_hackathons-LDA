                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flexible Power is about equipping the war fighter for efficient and effective surveillance and for the easy, power efficient transfer of data to HQ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flexible Power kinetically creates power while war fighters march/hike/surveil targets using ARL technology developed for the DARPA Warrior Web Program.  We'll focus our pitch on reducing the weight the War Fighter carries on a mission and we'll utilize the Warrior Web to make the load lighter until we iterate a more efficient battery. We have some transmission suggestions but they're not the focus of our project - All non-essential functions are stripped from major power-drawing devices (routers, computers) and those functions are completed by stripped down iPhones where necessary. The Raspberry Pi acts as an energy efficient router with a special 3-D antenna included for transmission via HAM radio to a pre-agreed-upon location.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By creating a team of individuals who reflect our values.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limitations of the technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team of two interviewed more than 20 mentors to get a clear picture as to what the War Fighter experiences in the field and we augmented our team to include an application developer and a software engineer to prove out our concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innovation may know no boundaries but physics does - we welcome the opportunity to layer our technology, to iterate, to pivot, to learn, grow, and change as the requirements of our customers change.
                </p>

                    What's next for Flexible Power (AKA Ironman)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we complete a friends and family round of funding, we'll pursue $400K in a seed round before launching into a series of opportunities for investors. We anticipate needing $5-$10M in R&amp;D and our time to market of our MVP is 18 months.
