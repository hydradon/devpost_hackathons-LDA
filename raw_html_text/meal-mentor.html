                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this application for the purpose of having a convenient tool to help users find recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application will take in 3 parameters from the user:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        What ingredients they have
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The range of calories intake
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How long the meal takes to cook
From here it will filter out the recipes the match what the user entered.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop our mobile application and also integrated the Edamam API for recipe searches. We used a tool called Postman to help us analyze the JSON data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much experience in Android Studio so we spent a lot of time learning it. After figuring out Android Studio, we spent a lot of time trying to integrate the API into our application. We also got stuck while working with multiple activities in Android Studio. For instance, we got multiple errors while trying to transfer data from one activity to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about API's and coding in Android Studio. For the first few hours, we were having trouble getting started but then we starting to really focus and made significant progress the rest of the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about API's and how to integrate them into mobile applications. We also learned how to develop and design in Android Studio. We learned how to fetch data from JSON response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meal Mentor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement a few more features that we didn't have time to add. First of all, we were just short on time to complete our user interface. It currently outputs the data to the console. In the future, we plan to add more nutrition information, have the ability to sort by meal type, generate a random meal, sort by cooking experience, and display ratings for the recipe.
