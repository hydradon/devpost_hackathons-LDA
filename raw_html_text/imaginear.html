                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data is all around us.  We have made it our mission to re-imagine how we make connections between people and data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application has the potential to take large amounts of data and provide a real-time collaborative environment incorporating augmented reality and web to allow the exploration between people and data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to extract data from a RestAPI of court cases in order to get data for our visualization.  Next we used Socket.IO to create a real-time collaborative environment for the application.  We used d3.js to create dynamic web visualizations coupled together with Unity to create a Microsoft Hololens friendly user experience.  We are hosting our website on Amazon Web Services and are using NameCheap to host our domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all of the separate components that each individual team member developed took longer than anticipated.  Additionally, each component has its own standards that didn&rsquo;t always work well together for integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how seamlessly we were able to get the experience to feel across our different components.  Each piece of software is able to supplement the entire package resulting in a unique cross-platform experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never worked with d3.js or Socket.IO so we were able to learn how to use these powerful libraries.  We had also never attempted to create a cross-platform application between the Hololens and the web which was super exciting for us to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ImagineAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to expand ImagineAR beyond just the judiciary dataset that we used for this hackathon.  We think that our project has the ability to change the way people look at data.
