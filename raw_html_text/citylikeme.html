                    The Summary

                <p>
                    Recent College Grads are not finding companies and cities whose culture they fit and as a result they are less engaged at work and at home. The lowered work engagement manifests itself in worse work performance by the college grads and lost revenue by employers. The lowered city engagement manifests itself in less active civic life and social good projects.
