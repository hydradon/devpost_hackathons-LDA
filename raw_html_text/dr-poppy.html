                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create my own little quirky AI to help control my home. The home control part will come later, first I wanted to create a personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It interact with me. I feel less lonely now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using nodejs libraries to automatically do sentiment analysis and a markov chain library. I ended up building its own little intent parser. For roasting people, it uses reddit for a large amount of the time, but it will occasionally come up with roasts and toasts based on the markov chains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And creating something that can pass for a very off topic human. The earliest versions of the bot were very off topic, and now it is slightly less. Reddit has a decent enough json api, only you can't sort comments by the top one. I increased my sample size and dropped all of the lower comments to get around that issue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using markov chains, and working with messenger's web api instead of their standard bot one.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main thing I learned is how difficult intent parsing is. I tried to create an intent system based on what Mycroft and possibly Alexa have done. Intent parsing is surprisingly hard, since it is more than just searching. You also need to consider words within other words, such as the word hi in "within".

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to marry it with my personal home automation system to have an actual AI in my house, not just a command prompt to turn music on and off.
