                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we realized thousands of fish and marine life were dying because of poor human decisions, we knew something needed to change. In an attempt to spread awareness of this issue, we created a website, learning css and html on the way, that sheds light on a topic known as Dead Zones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website shows information about one of the many issues that affect the ocean, dead zones, with some real data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - Learned CSS and HTML from Codecademy, and used that knowledge to build a site.
                </h2>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into - Small syntax errors in the code were challenging to find, but caused errors and prevented the program from working properly. The learning gap was also a challenge that we overcame.

                    Oceans, modifications to include the overfishing problem around the world. Also, to retrieve real-time data from an API and to make dynamic changes after learning JavaScript.
