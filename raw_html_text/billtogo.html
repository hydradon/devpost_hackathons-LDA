                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had very little experience working with Android applications before, so when we saw Bill.com's challenge of implementing their workflows onto various IOT devices, we thought that we could both grow our skills and work on some cool tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application uses the Bill.com Java Library API to fulfill the major workflows of Bill.com. It completes an MFA challenge, then allows the user to either submit payments to vendors (payables) or request invoices from consumers (receivables). The values are then stored in our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the app in Android Studio (Java) and developed/debugged on a Fossil Smart Watch (Android).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges in making this project. First, we had issues setting up Android Studio and ADB so we could run our program on the watch. Then, we had problems grabbing text from input fields for the MFA authentication step. Finally, we had issues with null pointer exceptions when trying to store our data gathered from the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making an application! We are really proud of the work we've done, especially learning to work with Android Studio and ADB, designing various layouts, and learning how to lay out a structure of processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot, especially from our mistakes. We will definitely have a better grasp of Android projects in the future. We also learned how stylish and comfortable the Fossil Smart Watches (totally not sponsored... unless?)

                    What's next for BillToGo

                <p>
                    Dynamically updating vendors, customers, invoices, and bills so the user can see them once they've submitted.
