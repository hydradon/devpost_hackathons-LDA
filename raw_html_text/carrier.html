                <p>
                    The application was developed for those who do not know exactly what healthcare institution they should be visiting for a health concern. The healthcare industry loses millions of dollars every year when people are hospitalized in the ER simply for not knowing where someone should admit themselves. Having all resources available to you, including clinics and mobile services allows you to make an educated choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is able to collect all data that your healthcare application contain, and if any of the areas that are considered "standard" for your lifestyle experience a spike, you get notified and categorized. You then get a recommendation for certain areas near you.
