                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning tools are not currently engaging enough to inspire children and students to desire a higher level of knowledge in particularly difficult subjects such as mental math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our virtual reality game provides a more engaging and exciting way to learn mental math and algebra. A series of equations floats in front of the user, one of which is incorrect which the user is expected to pinpoint and slash out with a special virtual reality controller. The further the user progresses by correctly slashing out the incorrect equation, the harder the equations become to solve, as well as floating faster around the user. The result is a student or individual who is quick on their feet and well versed pertaining to the subject of mental math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back end in microsoft visual studio 2017 and worked on the front end with the unreal engine 4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we had the major problem of not being able to connect the Oculus Rift, but we eventually figured it out and got a working system going. Also we Could not get the equations our c++ back-end code created to float around the user with the cylinder backdrops we had intended them to be attached to. Furthermore we ran out of time and could not get a fully working version of our game produces, although we came extraordinarily close to finishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of getting the Oculus Rift system working with the unreal engine. We were having a ton of trouble with that and had a celebratory moment when it finally worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the basics of c++, along with how to create a working unity project centered around virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SolVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing up the last bit of our game and tying it all together into a fully working project. Also adding harder challenges and expanding into more areas of study which students have trouble with.
