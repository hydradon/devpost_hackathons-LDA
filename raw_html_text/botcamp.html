                <p>
                    In the game you must create a robot for each level.  In each level you will be faced with various tasks to complete.  It is your job to construct a robot capable of navigating the course and completing the task within 60 seconds.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game using unity and coding in C#.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea was to make it more interactive by letting the player "program" their robot, using visual coding blocks (in a similar manner that people use Scratch to program).  However, we quickly realized that this idea was too time consuming to complete in the duration of bitcamp.  We compromised and made it solely about constructing a robot and using the keys on your keyboard (W,A,S,D) to move your robot through the course.  Throughout the development of our game we faced general problems like dividing tasks between team members and working on the project all at once.  This also ate into our allotted time.

                    We are very proud of the final product that we were able to produce.  We believe the user interface is the strongest aspect of our project.  The

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity that we didn't already know.  Just sitting and working on the game for 36 hours gives you experience to learn from and helps you with future mistakes.
