                <p>
                    The leading factor of our survival as humans has been socialization and collaboration - activities made unbelievably easy with our recent advancements in technology and engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can call someone on the other side of the world and see their faces in real time. We can play competitive video games, collaborate on google docs, share open source code on github, access repositories of images and writing, stream high definition videos, inform the world of our thoughts on a whim, and even then, there&rsquo;s so much more we can now do, to the extent that this brief description barely begins to scratch the surface of the complex beauty of the invention known as the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the best tools available for free to create something that will significantly improve the quality of human life while costing nothing for the people that use it. We created something that can easily be implemented onto one of the world&rsquo;s leading social media platforms by someone with no coding experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After careful analysis of various products of its kind, we were able to make the FraserBot (named after this hackathon). It proves to be a great mental exercise, increases endorphin output, and strengthens social bonds among your peers using something very nostalgic to a large number of people - video games.
                </p>

                    It&rsquo;s a bot that plays the party game called Mafia. I think you&rsquo;ve probably heard of it. If not, we&rsquo;ll show it when we demonstrate its functionality. It implements advanced algorithms like if statements and while loops to play a simple version of the game. (we&rsquo;re beginners)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This bot allows you to play mafia with 3 other friends on Discord. There are 3 roles - Innocent, Medic and Mafia. There is a day and night phase every day. During the day, everyone votes to kill someone they believe is part of the Mafia. During the night, the Mafia will kill one villager they choose. However, the Medic may save someone they choose. If the person they save is the same as the person selected to be killed, the person will not die. The day and night phases will keep going until either all mafias are killed, or if there are an equal or lesser amount of mafias and innocents.
