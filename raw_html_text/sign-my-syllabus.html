                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year middle schools and high schools across the United States waste millions of pieces of paper on printing out the syllabus for each class. In those same schools, many students also struggle to have their parents sign the syllabus and return it on-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to fix these problems by giving schools an easy, paper-free way to manage class syllabi.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sign My Syllabus gives parents, teachers, and students an easy, paper free way to manage a class syllabus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a simple website, teachers can upload a syllabus for their course and share it with their students and parents. Teachers are able to view all of the students and parents who have signed the syllabus for each class. For those who haven't signed, teachers can send a reminder (through email or text message) to students and parents letting them know that they need to sign the course syllabus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students can use the website to sign the syllabus for each of their courses. They can also send a reminder (through email or text) to their parents letting them know that they need to sign the syllabus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents can use the website to see and sign the syllabus for each class that their child is enrolled in.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, Tomcat, raw Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, and spent a bunch of time programming and designing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few small challenges while trying to use the Docusign Api, but those were easily conquered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also ran into a challenge with our build system. Originally we had our Tomcat deployment and testing environment set up on one laptop in Eclipse. However, we soon found many problems with that due to dependency management. We then had to create a new build and testing workflow from scratch to handle or Tomcat project. Using gradle, we were eventually able to cross this hurdle and our build system now works better than ever.
