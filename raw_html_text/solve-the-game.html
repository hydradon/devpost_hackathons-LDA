                    Anyone can play all the Adventure, Escape Room, &amp; Mystery Detective voice games on our platform, all with advanced features. You can move around, pick up and use objects, and even talk with people and characters in the games! But be careful because sometimes things have hidden meanings or you might have to ask twice to find the true answer! Not everything is as it seems! Sometimes a clue you got early on will be critical later! Ask for help any time to learn just how to play. Some parts are easy and obvious and others will require some serious thinking! The game remembers where you left off, so you can take a break any time. CAN YOU DO IT? CAN YOU WIN? HOW MANY STEPS WILL IT TAKE YOU?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since new games are being added all the time, you can easily change games any time, and virtually never run out of fun games to play! Your position in each game will be saved, too, in case you want to switch back and forth. You can rate the games you play and even leave comments for the game developers. You can hear a list of the most popular games, newest games, or even play a random game! HOW MANY GAMES CAN YOU SOLVE?!

                    We've invested thousands of hours of intense programming on this new Alexa Skill and are so incredibly proud of it because it lets ANYONE become a Voice-Game Developer! Each game developer can decide entirely how they want to build their own games, from a basic adventure game, to an escape-the-room-style game, or maybe even a virtual landscape, a murder-mystery, or even an intelligent robot-type of interaction. All this is under the developers' control through our Voice Game Developer Console at

                    Our goal was to make the BEST voice game ever, and we feel we have really accomplished this! We are redefining family night! It is like Version 2.0 of Story Telling! Imagine the whole family sitting around Alexa to play voice games on Solve The Game&trade;. With 1000s of players becoming developers, we expect 1000s of games available in a short while! ANYONE can now make their own games! And it's so fun hearing your own creation!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first full-featured voice game in the world where the player is also the game developer! We take something that used to be hard and make it easy because there&rsquo;s no programming languages to learn, software to buy, or servers to maintain! Best of all, it's entirely free to build your own voice games! WE ARE SO EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU&rsquo;RE GOING TO BUILD!!
