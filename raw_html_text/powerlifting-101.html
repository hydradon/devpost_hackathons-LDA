                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both team members are interested in the sport and wanted to share that knowledge with others. We both were not well versed in web development coming into hackUMBC and wanted to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an introductory app to the sport of powerlifting for anyone who may not know what it is. Powerlifting is a specific discipline of strength training focused around the three competition lifts: squat, bench, and deadlift. The app also calculates the individual's wilks score, which is a standardized measure that allows ease of comparison of lifters over different weight classes and sexes, allowing them to see how they stack up against the world record holders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a combination of NodeJS, Angular5, HTML, CSS, Javacript for the server and client side in addition to canvasjs for data visualization, firebase for hosting services, and domain.com for our domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was our inexperience with web development as a whole. That in addition to the fickle nature of angular made this an tough, but extremely rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that, as a team of 2 people with no web development experience, we were able to actually get a demoable product that is well put together. The learning curve was huge, but through persistence we were able to make it through. This is also the first app either of us were able to host successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot from this hackathon. We came in with next to no experience with web development and left with a working web app! We learned a lot about the various languages that we used, and how to host servers, both locally and via the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Wilky Way
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would definitely love to build on this in turn it into a mix of companies such as powerliftingwatch.com and bodybuilding.com as we improve on our features and our UI.
