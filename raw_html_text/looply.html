                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to listen to music at MHacks, we kept having to adjust the volume because of the varying noise level. That's how we got the idea for a small lightweight utility to automatically adjust volume based on ambient noise, kind of like an auto-brightness for sound.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project using Swift for OS X. We have plans to make it cross-platform in the future.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a majority of our time fine-tuning and calibrating the algorithm used to determine volume adjustments.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We settled on using a polynomial regression on the data points the user chose for background noise versus output sound level, and used that to apply a function for future predictions and adjustments.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of Swift and the OSX framework!

                <p>
                    Lots more polish, a better setup UI, multiplatform support, and publishing to the app store / online.
