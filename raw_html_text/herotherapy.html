                    HeroTherapy is an application based on Unity that allows single or multiple users to have a VR experience for chemotherapy sessions for children of cancer clinics.  In VR - thank to chemo going through their veins - they are becoming superheroes(!) and with superpowers, destroying cancer cells. The children will feel calmer, stronger, and empowered during their VR chemotherapy session.
