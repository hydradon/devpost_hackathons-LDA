                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stress, Depression, and Anxiety play a negative influence in many lives, including ours. Many people at our school have taken away their lives because of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an app that reduces stress, anxiety, and depression, hopefully reducing the risk of someone to suicide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built with swift on xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to use mp4 files because of the wifi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make an entire working app in less than an entire day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how important time is, and not to procrastinate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resolving Mental Health Issues
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the app more interactive, and be able to add audio and video.
                </p>
