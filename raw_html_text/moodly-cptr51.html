                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moodly's cause -- fostering positive mental health -- is one very close to my own heart. I struggled with my own mental health over the last year, finding that I wasn't the best at figuring out how I was feeling before it started to impact my day. When I eventually took up journaling, I realized that I could get a feel of my emotional state on a previous day by just reading through my account of it. My verbiage, the events I focused on, the passivity of my voice, it all painted a clear picture of how I was doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that got me thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did it just have to be through introspection that these patterns could be meaningful? And from that question, Moodly was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moodly is a live audio journal that provides real-time analysis on mood and underlying emotional states. Talk to it while you fold your laundry, walk to class -- however you want to use it. Just talk, about anything you like, and Moodly will process your speech patterns, visualizing useful metrics through a friendly graphical interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moodly was built specifically as an assistive tool for people with mental health disabilities. When your whole day can start to spiral from a small pattern of negative thoughts and feelings, it's extremely important to stay in touch with your emotional state. Moodly allows the user to do exactly that, in an effort-free form factor that feels like the furthest thing from an evaluation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moodly is a Python script that combines Rev.ai's speech-to-text software and IBM's Watson tonal analysis suite to provide an accurate and thorough assessment of a speaker's style and content. First, an audio stream is created using PyAudio. Then, that stream is connected via a web socket to Rev.ai's web API to generate a transcript of the session. That transcript is fed via REST API to IBM's Watson analysis, and the interpreted data is displayed using a custom-built graphical interface utilizing the Zelle python library.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moodly has multiple processes running at very distinct time scales, so synchronizing all of the processes into a single, smooth user experience was a challenge and a half.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm super proud of the graphical interface! This was my first time plotting anything that wasn't a simple line graph in Python, and I really love how the end result came out -- intuitive, clean, and attention-grabbing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost: AI is awesome! But more importantly, I learned to ywork efficiently -- without a team, I didn't have time to get bogged down, especially when every library used was a first time for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moodly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd love to consider more data patterns in order to create more useful and higher-level emotional classifications.
