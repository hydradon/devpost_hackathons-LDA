                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Texas is the second most food insecure state in the US. After hearing this, we wanted to come up with a solution to help consumers prevent food waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile friendly website allows consumers to upload pictures of their food. Our website then recognizes the food and the expected expiration period. The program we wrote texts the user as the expected expiration date approaches and reminds the user to use their food item. Currently, only food and vegetables are detected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a database of expiration dates based on the type of produce. The backend of the web application is made using node.js and python. Push notification is executed using Twilio. Once the image is uploaded, our program recognizes the food item using the Azure cognitive AI and sends push notifications according to the expiration date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the Azure API into properly into our program. Our members all have different specializations so it was difficult combining our backend product and frontend product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of integrating the Azure API into our program was painstakingly long. Once we got it to work, the attitude of our group instantly became better. Cries were heard when the program successfully recognized multiple types of produce and the correct text message is sent out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attended a workshop where Microsoft taught us how to utilize Microsoft Azure. After multiple rounds of trial and error, we were able to successfully implement that into our project. We used their computer AI recognition to recognize food products via images and send a text to the families in need about the expected expiration date of the food items in the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StayFresh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to allow the program to periodically send texts to the user so that the consumer is constantly reminded. This is to prevent unexpected early expiration and allows times for the user to plan a use for their food item. We also intend to include a system that shows local food banks and food pantries in order to encourage the user to donate their food if they find that they do not have a use for their food item any more.
