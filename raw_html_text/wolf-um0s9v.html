                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, the first two functions (Binomial and Poisson) are there because I wanted to work on machine learning or some sort of AI, but on my way there I learned how awesome Alexa plus WolframAlpha can be. I just wish I had come to that realization earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So I was able to learn Javascript and was able to add three different functions, Binomial calculator, Poisson calculator and CommonName.
Binomial and Poisson calculator are exactly what they sound like. For example, if you wanted to calculate the probability of getting two heads out of ten trials, given the probability of success or failure, you can use Alexa "Wolf" to calculate.

                <p>
                    Mostly, a friend named Nathan. Also, from youtube videos, reading stack overflow and other such websites.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for me this Hackathon was not knowing what to do, and how to do it. This being my first Hackathon, it was awesome, but I wish I had known a bit more about what happens at a Hackathon.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. I tried my best to learn as much as I could, and I did. I learned how to program in JavaScript, Alexa Skills - Kit, integrating WolframAlpha API and ton of other things while helping others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I had to learn how to program in Javascript and the quickest way to do that was by watching videos and reading as much as possible. Also, I ended up making a few projects while trying to learn how to get Alexa to say what I want.
Eventually I got the hang of it, but then it was too late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wolf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I will check and see if it is legal for me to integrate Alexa with WolframAlpha as much as I think I can. If so, I will probably integrate it fully and make it open source. If not, I will make whatever part of Wolf I am allowed to make open source, open source.
