                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we wanted to make an app to help people navigate the city, so, with Opentrends vision in mind, we decided to have a look at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app detects what's the nearest Monument around you and displays how far are you from it. Once you get there, the app will show you some information of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it for android using android studio. The app code is written in Java, and the database, using MySQL and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had almost no experience with databases, so it was quite a big challenge to connect the phone with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What's out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more Monuments to our database to make it more enjoyable.
