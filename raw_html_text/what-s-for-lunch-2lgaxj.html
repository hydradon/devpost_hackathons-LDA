                <p>
                    Who hasn't made lunch plans with friends, only to have the restaurant location change last minute? Your newly acquired taste for Italian is suddenly left unsatiated. The
                    <strong>
                        What's for Lunch?
                    </strong>
                    app helps prepare you for these last minute changes.

                    After inputting some simple search criteria,
                    <strong>
                        What's for Lunch?
                    </strong>
                    seamlessly presents search results for restaurants offering something completely unlike what you are craving.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of Xcode and sheer willpower, we built this app with the indecisive eater in mind.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oddly enough, software is much easier to write when it performs logical functions- allowing the user's inputs to trigger
                    <em>
                        opposite
                    </em>
                    responses was a challenge.

                    We would love to expand into the dinner and breakfast markets!
