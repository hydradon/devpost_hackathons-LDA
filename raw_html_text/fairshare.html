                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the hackathon we were puzzled trying to find the best way to divide a pizza slice evenly. We came up with an idea of an app that helps you decide how to cut food on even pieces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You tell the app the dimensions of your food, it decides how to cut it for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript and html. In the future we plan to use image recognition API to make the app even more professional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial idea was to make it a phone app that interacts with camera and plans out where to cut the food on a photo. Soon we realized that time constraints of a hackathon force us to go for a simplified version.

                <p>
                    use API to take picture of food recognize the shape and the app gives the best possible cutting method. perhaps we can also use augmented reality technology to make it even better. there is a lot we can do to improve this app in the future.
