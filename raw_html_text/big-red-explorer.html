                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hate seeing walls of text when looking for something simple! No wikipedia, please! :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges the way we show and consume information on the web. Instead of providing walls of text for simple queries, we provide an intuitive, unique and engaging graphical interface - allowing us to explore more and bump into things we otherwise won't have explored - all without losing context of what we were originally looking at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a few existing Cognitive APIs from Microsoft, used DBPedia and Wikipedia as much as we could + some basic HTML, CSS, Scripting skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to generate the cleaned, filtered data we actually wanted, that we feel captures the essence of what we want to represent!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Come, visit us for a demo - we are changing the way we explore and experience textual content!
