                    Detects if a stranger is approaching from behind and notifies the app via Bluetooth which in turn alerts the user. The app can say hello back, or send a message to the user's chosen emergency contact telling them that there is a stalker.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Arduino and Android Studio development environments using C and Java.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth.... Bluetooth connectivity from the Android app to the HC-05 Bluetooth transmitter didn't work!!! That was the reason why we couldn't finish this project, everything should have been easy in comparison.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides the failure with Bluetooth, we are very proud of the app and hardware that worked in the first place. The hardware was able to detect human presence and theoretically transmit that data over Bluetooth. Another achievement we're proud of is that Google Maps was implemented successfully and the permissions worked out on the first time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Bluetooth has its own nuances and to be more prepared next time.
