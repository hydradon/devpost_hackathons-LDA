                    INSPIRATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by hearing the devastating statement of our dear friend Tony-
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        "The hardest part of being homeless is not the lack of shelter, it's feeling like you don't have a voice - like you don't have meaning."
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those experiencing homelessness are people who have names, stories, hopes, and dreams. h&uuml;m strives to humanize homelessness by giving a voice to the voiceless, goods to those in need, opportunities to the downtrodden, and most importantly - a spark for actual
                    <em>
                        human connection.

                <h2>
                    WHAT IT DOES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recipients make a profile and share their story in a short video. In their profile, they can specify relevant information about their needs and particular skills they have. Their profiles are then populated via geo-location to nearby people who have the desire and means to help. Connections are formed and relationships are developed further in a chat interface that hopefully culminates in a face-to-face meeting, the delivery of a particular good, or a job opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    HOW WE BUILT IT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on UI/UX and poured our efforts into interactive mockups that showcased video of real people experiencing homelessness to emphasize the impact h&uuml;m could have if it were a real app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plan is to build in React Native or Flutter for quick cross-platform prototyping with a backend hosted on AWS.

                    CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limiting our scope to a mobile platform knowing that many but not all have access to smartphones and those who do have a hard time keeping them charged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ensuring security and safety for both users. Eliminating the possibility of money transfer. Establishing public locations for meetups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE MOST PROUD OF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fantastic product design, color scheme, logo, and concept. A plan to move forward regarding goals and resource allocation. The collaboration, work distribution, and interdisciplinary team dynamic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    WHAT WE LEARNED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that meals, shelter, and physical goods while being important, are still temporary fixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned about the many reasons the homeless population would be wary of people, the prevalence of human trafficking, and the soul-crushing reality of barely being acknowledged let alone treated like another human being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the technical side - we learned UI/UX concepts, hardware design, programming, agile, user stories, software dev prototyping skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    WHAT'S NEXT FOR H&Uuml;M
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue developing the plan and will look for more help on the software development side.
