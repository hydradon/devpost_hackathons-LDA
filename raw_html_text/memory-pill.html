                    </strong>
                    This was the case with Target's red prescription bottle. Called "Clear RX", it was much more readable than the traditional pill bottle, preventing accidents and increasing user satisfaction. However, in 2016 Target switched back to cylindrical orange bottles,

                    <strong>
                        Our idea was to solve the readability problem of prescription bottles by creating a mobile app that visualizes the important information in an easy to read format.
                    </strong>
                    Rather than scrap the orange bottles entirely, companies could add QR codes to the bottles that, when scanned, present the most important information to the user. Our original concept for this app involved displaying who the product is for and instructions on how to use it, as well as remind the user whether or not they've already taken their medication.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the
                    <strong>
                        Merck Supply Chain Blockchain Lab API
                    </strong>
                    to communicate information about the products. This involved using Unity's WWW class to get a response from endpoint URLs, and parsing the response with the JsonUtility class. We also used the
                    <strong>
                        ZXing plugin
                    </strong>
                    to read the QR code in Unity.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to time limitations we were only able to create a prototype of the application we envisioned. We were not able to get to adding our own trade items to the Blockchain that would have identified individual prescriptions. This meant that we did not include the wealth of information that we first envisioned for this application.

                <p>
                    We were able to successfully read the QR code on a mobile phone and provide a look at what the engaging results screen would look like.
