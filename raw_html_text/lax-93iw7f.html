                        Humans have the tendency to make simple things complicated.
                    </strong>
                    I've developed a program intended to guide the user back to comfort. Let's sit back and Lax.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    C++, Finger-Knuckle Grease, and Optimisim

                    Setting a timer. within c++ to allow for a more realistic feel.

                <p>
                    Finishing the product in c++ within the time period. and creating something that probably everyone that competed may have needed the past day.

                    What's next for Lax'

                <p>
                    Conversion from C++ to an app for iPhone and Android. This improved app may also use wearable technology to better time the exercises and decide whether or not a loop for longer breathing beyond the initial minute is necessary.
