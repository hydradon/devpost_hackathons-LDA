                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to solve posture problems that students face
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sensors detect deviation from regular posture and buzzes to alert user when their posture is not right, which is all attached on the human like an iron man suit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Arduino, lots of tapes and wires, ball/tilt sensors, and laser emitter, photoresistor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receiving light source, attaching the receivers onto the body. We went thoroughly with other hackers but it was still difficult to solve, so we decided to use different sensors which are just as reliable. It was also challenging to attach the wiring and breadboard/circuit boards to the t-shirt of user which can fully implement the sensors, and it took a lot of time to fully calibrate them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much our first hardware project; we learned a lot of Arduino overall as computer science students
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, grinding out projects, and solving hardware problems, no matter how long it takes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vertalign
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a full-blown suit similar to iron man which does more than correcting posture, as well as more efficient ways of tracking movement (using more sophisticated sensors next time which may be available such as gyroscopes)
