                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to track our personal growth using the simple prompt, "What did you do today?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application that would allow the user to type in what they did on a particular day and analyze what the user enters. We will also store what the user did by date so the user can &ldquo;archive&rdquo; everyday of their life. The user can come back any time in their life to see what they did on a particular day and their sentiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allow users to become more self-aware of their daily personal growth
Track feelings and activities
Mental awareness
Helpful for therapists or people with depression
Allow the user to keep an archive of their life and how they felt each day based on text analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the IBM Natural Language Understanding API using Machine Learning to analyze data the user inputs so we could perform sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made our own classification model that would classify each word to a particular sentiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a web application as a way for the user to type/store what they did everyday. Coded in HTML and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We had problems being able to call the API, but we overcame it.
2) We had problems that did not allow us to call external JS functions using require, so we had to give the raw JSON output from the API
3) We had troubles toward the end trying to fit the graphs in, but we did not have time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We were able to implement machine learning into our program
2) We were able to learn about using APIs from IBM and working with JSON files
3) We were able to make something as a team that we would not have been able to make individually
4) We were able to make something that can have a significant impact on people's lives by improving their self-awareness and mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use machine learning API's. We also got more experience creating websites in html, js, and css. We learned how to use the IBM Natural language understanding API. We learned how to collaborate effectively and divide tasks efficiently.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sentima
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make our web application also an iOS app and Android app 
Graph the percentages of the different sentiments each day
Store the users past entries 
Add a more secure login system
Be able to export the user data to CSV
Link user&rsquo;s information to psychologists if the user gives permission
