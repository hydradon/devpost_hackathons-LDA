                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends mom is a doctor and said that the problem her and her doctor friends were having is that the they cannot access their patients files sometimes and patients have bad recollection of previous medical history on such things. We found that we could create a platform for patients to be able to record and keep track of their own medical history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a form for people to fill out based on previous or current medical history to be able to keep track and help doctors help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with 4 developers each splitting up roles. We used GitHub as a version control. We created a front and repo and backend repo. The front end was coded with react while the backend was coded in Node.js with express using a sql database. We first discussed on features and functionality then we created a design on how it would be based on looking. We then split into two groups working on the frontend and backend.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was thinking of a project to make, the second challenge came right after which was arguing about how the design and functionality of this project would look like. The third challenge was getting just getting everything to show the way we wanted to, there were multiple similar problems over the past two days where the project was not working the way we wanted it to.
