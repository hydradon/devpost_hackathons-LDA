                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student who struggled in high school to find a college that would be right for me. My goal is to create things that would have helped me out when I was younger. If this project is implemented, it could help many students find the right college.

                <p>
                    College Fit comes into the picture in high school, when choosing colleges: a very proactive student could look at maybe 30 colleges, but likely less than that. This is a problem as there are hundreds if not thousands of colleges that he or she cannot consider. With College Fit, a student can tell an application what they want in an ideal college, and the application will give him or her a list of colleges that would best match that ideal college.
College Fit helps to streamline the process and use modern machine learning and web scrapping of first person sources/ reviews to build models that can establish a 'fit' of a person's college experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way it works on that back end is that there is a script that scrapes review data from sites like niche.com or U.S. News College Rankings. After gathering the reviews, the data would be combined and put though a program that uses a natural language processing API, such as Google Cloud Natural Language Processing, or IBM&rsquo;s Watson. By running a sentiment analysis, the program can find the specific advantages and disadvantages of each aspect of a college.  From that point, there would need to be another program that weights the salience (importance/relevance) and of each general area (sports, academics, extra-curriculars, etc) as well as more specific groups (in sports: baseball, tennis, etc.) After all the information is sorted and weighted, it will be compared to the provided student data. The student data could be gathered in multiple ways including an few paragraphs about what they want in their ideal college, or a survey with choices such as &ldquo;A good physics department is important to me, rate 1-5 with 1 being it is not important&rdquo;. By using this data to create a profile of the student, we can used a combination of the college&rsquo;s and student&rsquo;s  difference in their weights and sentiments to arrive at a score that can predict how well a college would match a given student.

                    -Honestly, I learned: I knew nothing.
-It was a hefty and tedious learning curve. Filled with confusion, pain and the will to give up.
