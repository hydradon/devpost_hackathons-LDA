                    **Our story begins in the fall of 2016. 4 freshmen from very different backgrounds teamed together on this very day to form the most intelligent, most API intensive application ever. We present to you, on this very day, Volun-near.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    **What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application is designed to make volunteering less boring.... by inviting a friend! Or a random stranger with a similar passion! From our database of volunteer opportunities we get opportunities for each unique user and match each user with another user based on their choices and preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    **Challenges we ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a backend that needs to sync up with our frontend was excessively difficult. Our IP messaging was extremely had to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    **What I learned
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned how to deploy a Python webserver using flask.
