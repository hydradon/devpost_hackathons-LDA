                <p>
                    Climate change is not a hoax, but many politicians wants us to believe it is. Climate change is real and we are already seeing the consequences of that phenomenon, recent hurricanes Harvey that flooded Houston, and Irma which resulted in mass evacuations of almost all Floridian residents, are recent examples of the kinds of destruction caused by climate change.
