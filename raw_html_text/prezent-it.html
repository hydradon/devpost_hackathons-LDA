                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attending the Velocity Venture Fund Pitch Qualifiers, one of ours team members realized that there was a need for pitchers to practice their presentations. Further, we all agreed that it would be helpful for any presenters to be able to practice and review their presentations prior to an event. Often, presenters are unable to get an unbiased critique of their presentation. We scoured the app market and web apps but discovered that there was no simple solution to this problem. We decided to provide THE solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows presenters to record themselves presenting over a set duration of time, emulating their real presentation. This is similar to how athletes improve in their abilities, by watching themselves perform. The only required inputs for the app are setting a presentation duration time and pressing a go button. The user session is recorded and is available for playback later, in app.
