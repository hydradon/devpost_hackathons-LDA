                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that a major challenge that farmers are faced with is financial support. This is a big hindrance in their operations in the sense that they may not have sufficient funds at a particular moment when they need certain resources. So we developed a platform to curb that issue and enable continuous operation of the farms. However, we did not limit it to monetary resources. There are varieties of things to loan such as assets, labor, products, services and so on
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Agriloan is  a web-based platform that connects farmers with resources
The platform connects farmers who do not have certain resources to loaners who can provide such resources in a mutually beneficial negotiation which they do independently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Powered with PHP and MySQL, All users are stored in the database and all interaction is made using PHP mailer and twillo
We began with the wireframes for the project using Figma to design the user interface and then made use of  HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap for the front-end while using PHP for the backend. Sample data was created for potential farmers and loaners to exercise the variety of loanable elements on the platform.
We employed the use of .Tech domain to create a domain name for our project then hosted it on the Linode server. The Twilio API was also integrated into the platform for message notifications to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding a way to contact farmers when an investor shows interest was a challenge because we realise not all of them will have access to emails or visiting the site frequently - twillo came to the rescue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hosting on linode was a big step, we face alot of challenges as regards this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we had to make a big modification towards the end of the project. Initially, We wanted only farmers to make the request, But we decided that investors should also be able to showcase resources they would like to loan out
                </p>
