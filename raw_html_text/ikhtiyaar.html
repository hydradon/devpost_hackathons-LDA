                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2013, Pakistan ranked at a staggeringly low 127 among 175 countries which, both ironically and sadly, is still the best ranking we have been able to achieve so far. Since our last government, the statistics have improved a little, but there is still a need for more drastic measures to be taken on a government scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to provide a technological means for solving the aforementioned issues in our country, and to hopefully collaborate with the KPK provincial government to aid us in implementing this project in future. The aim is to improve transparency, accountability and inclusiveness of government institutions and processes, and moreover, to allow for easy communication between the government institutions and the poor and marginalized people.

                    </em>
                    is an initiative to address the corruption and transparency issues prevalent in our system of government. It's a prototype for website where users can give their feedback by posting their issues/complaints online and keep updated about other people&rsquo; problems and concerns in their area.

                    </strong>
                    is used to get information about the user posting the complaint. Users can simply login using their Facebook IDs, saving them from remembering extra passwords. An additional option for posting anonymously can be added later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While filing complaints, users have the option of including up to 5 photos with the complaint. They also have to select a category and provide their location. A partial voting system is included through which users can vote on complaints increasing their priority.

                <p>
                    For the front-end, we've used the popular and well-tested CSS framework,
                    <em>
                        Bootstrap
                    </em>
                    . jQuery plugins we've used include:

                        geocomplete

                    </a>
                    . Fonts used are
                    <em>
                        Open Sans
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        Crimson Text
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back-end is coded in PHP. We've used a third-party library
                    <em>
                        Ultimate MySQL library
                    </em>
                    for database communication.

                    </em>
                    is used to integrate the social login feature. Images are resized on-the-fly using
                    <em>

                <p>
                    A major challenge was to incorporate AJAX in posting complaints. Integrating the
                    <strong>
                        Dropzone
                    </strong>
                    plugin was another task difficult to implement for us.

                    We've paid special attention to the usability and practicality, and we're quite happy with how our design has turned out to be.

                    Nothing of significance really, except that this website has no practical use without the involvement of the government.

                <p>
                    Future work in Ikhtiyaar may involve adding a comments and proper system of voting. Other features would include:

                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    Administrator should have access to a dashboard where they can view all complaints, sorted into relevant categories. The admin should be able to respond to a complaint, and change its status once the issue is resolved.

                    </strong>
                    An SMS service could be added, to enable users to post complaints using only their cell-phones without the need to visit the website. Users would have the option to select how and when they should receive notifications about any updates.
