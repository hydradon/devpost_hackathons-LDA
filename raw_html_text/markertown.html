                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an application using the smart town theme that helps everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows people to collaborate on Google Maps. There, friends can plan outings together, draw on the map together, and browse parks and emergency shelters together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to make our backend. For the front end we used Javascript and Bootstrap to make our website. The app was hosted on Amazon Web Services with the help of Docker. We used Google Maps' API and Montreal's public data as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many ideas but trying to figure out which ones were feasible in terms of time to complete them given the APIs and data we had was difficult. Trying to get the sessions on different computers so sync up changes with each other was also very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a very nice website and made great use out of the Google Maps API. Most importantly, we gave ourselves goals and we were able to complete them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use flask to host a web app, as well as experimenting with pure Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MarkerTown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some ideas include making better use out of data provided by Google and Montreal better. For example, showing restaurants and their lines on our website or showing users where they can park in Montreal for free. We could also use a different tech stack for our app when we scale, in order to better manage the big data given to use and handle a larger load of users.
