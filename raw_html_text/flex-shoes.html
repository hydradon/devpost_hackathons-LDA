                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apparel art was a big interest within our team, and a better way of going about creating designs for shoes in particular would be very welcome for all of us. In conjunction with doubling as a Hackathon project, flex-shoes came to life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that lets you upload images and incorporates them into a shoe design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using React and React Router and the backend using Python's TensorFlow library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges figuring out how to combine sample designs to the image of the shoe. We also had challenges with react-dropzone to upload and render images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app can allow the user to upload an image of his or her choice and it can render on top of the picture of the shoe. We used Cloudinary to allow for the rendering of the inputted image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write a program to upload and render images without writing an extra server-side backend specifically for that by using Cloudinary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for flex-shoes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flex-shoes still needs to incorporate designs with the shoe. It needs to have a complete Python backend that processes the inputted image and the image of the shoe and combines them to form a unique shoe design.
