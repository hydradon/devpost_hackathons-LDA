                    This is a Domain.com domain-name entry. The domain I wanted to register is: samoasamoas.com. Unfortunately by the time I had this idea, the Domain.com coupons expired, so it's just hosted on my github pages.

                    I did not spend the entire hackathon working on this. Most of my time was spent with a dead-end Pebble app followed by a couple of other endeavors, none of which are in a state I'd be satisfied presenting. I thought the joke was worth spending a very short amount of time getting up and running, and I learned a little about web hosting along the way.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the domain name challenge for this hackathon. Nick said that he likes puns and I thought this name was so great that it needed a website to go along.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Push the button and another picture of a Samoa cookie appears on-screen.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and javascript. It's a very short program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never put anything up on github pages before so that was kind of challenging, but well-documented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    The name is great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how github pages work and a little about DNS and domain names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Samoa Samoas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think this is the peak for this little app, though I hope to take the things I've learned from hosting to bigger and better projects in the future.
