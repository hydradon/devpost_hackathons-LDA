                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the october cyber attacks that included targets such as US DNS servers and the country of Liberia, I knew something had to be done.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since these attacks were handled by botnets consisting of thousands of hacked iot devices, I wanted to make a program that could monitor and respond to iot devices connected to it.
