                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quality education is not possible when students cannot see the reasons for what they are learning, so we decided to go to the source of the problem and provide both institutions and students with a tool to bridge this gap.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualizes classes in a skill-based format based on the career opportunities they lead to.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We conduct research on the skills necessary for a variety of work fields, as well as the most popular career outcomes in the communities where DownToLearn is implemented. We compile these data, using JavaScripts React to handle the visualizations, into an adaptive visual map displaying the classes available alongside the skills each class helps the student develop when completed.
                </p>

                    Data handling. Complex data visualization in an interactive manner.
