                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I bet you are waiting for your hackatown diner right now and all you are thinking of is how you could skip this huge line.. Well sorry for you, there isn't any other hackatown as fun as the one at Polytechnique Montreal! We wanted to try out new technologies and use an API that emerged recently. Bring all the clues all together, yes we are lazy to wait. Clinics and Hospitals are places where you could do an entire hack and still be waiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gouvernemantal agencies could add a device to their already existing famous wait-in-line-ticket. Our application can publish data in real time, which gives good aproximation of the waiting time in each clinical establishments. Don't worry, it wont take you to British Columbia because it also takes into consideration the time you have to get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a web server as a REST API built in with NodeJS. It gives the possibility to store all the data to a PostgreSQL database and to filter the information of Clinia's API. Each "clinic" calculates their approximate waiting time and sends the data to the web server. On the Android application, we retreive the information of every clinics and we give the user the possibility to see the information of these, either on google maps or on a list.
