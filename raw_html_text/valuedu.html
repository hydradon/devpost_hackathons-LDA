                    Inspiration: With technology getting smaller and more capable, the inspiration of our project comes from the discovery of linking diverse, but powerful APIs into a small device to used for a purpose that pushes the boundaries of hardware, data, and creativity from a tiny sized piece of machinery called the Pebble Watch with practicality in consideration.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: integrates with IBM Bluemix api, chegg api, to find majors based on subject which is spoken into the Pebble Time's microphone and converted into text.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: With Cloudpebble with C to operate the mic, and JS to transfer data.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Many problems with API's being withheld by the companies that we wished to use, as well as scheduled maintenance that took down our major API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: The most time invested, most contacts established, most experience in an API environment gained in a weekend.  Not bad for my first hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: There are many hurdles, but they can be cleared.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ValuEDU: Beautification of the app, optimization of the data transfer in consideration of speed and security.
