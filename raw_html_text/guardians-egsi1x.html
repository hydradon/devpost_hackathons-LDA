                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    32,000 people in America die each year to car related accidents and 1.35 million around the world
20 to 50 million are injured every year around the world based on car related incidents
And depending in where you live, the average response time can be from 6 minutes to 30 minutes
During times of such crisis, it is important to immediately get the help that you require because the difference between life and death can be a matter of seconds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, Guardians, will immediately message your emergency contacts or loved ones such that if there was ever an accident, they can make sure that you are ok and if no one is able to respond or call you and you don't use the app, it will call 911.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works is by using the accelerometer from the phone, we can detect rapid decrease in speed and acceleration such that if there was ever a decrease, we can message their emergency contacts immediately and if there is no response from either the user or the emergency contact, it will call the police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By doing this, we can hopefully increase value in downloading messenger as we can reduce the average response time for potential injury or fatal crashes and get people the fast responses that they need which can have an immediate global impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to create a base app and took advantage of the accelerometer that is built in to the phone. Then we sent the message when there is a potential crash to messenger so that your emergency contacts gets notified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the accelerometer data, running tasks in background, messaging people/groups of people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT WORKSSSSSS. If messenger actually adds this to their app, I believe that it can add a lot of value as safety and family is an important concern for everyone.
