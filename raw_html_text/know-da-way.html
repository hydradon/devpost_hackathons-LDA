                <p>
                    This application is meant for all people, especially those who are directionally challenged. It is meant to allow users to have an easier time following directions from a maps application.

                    Know Da Way is a augmented Reality application that provides the user with a personal guide. The user can input a destination and the application will have an augmented reality arrow lead the way, making getting to places simpler and more entertaining.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenged we faced was implementing the AR aspect of the application. Specifically, understanding directional vectors and creating 3D avatars to be placed in the plane in front of the user.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that this application can be very useful, while being entertaining to its users. It takes the mundane task of following directions and makes it more clear and enjoyable.
