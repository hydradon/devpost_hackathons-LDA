                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have gone to a grocery store and forgotten what we need. Do I have this at home? How much do I have left? We wanted to create an app that can help consumers overcome this challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android app that can help users know what products they need to buy and in how much time it will run out. This app makes grocery shopping cost effective and efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we drew out what our screens would look like and what the specific function of each screen would be. Next, we used MIT App Inventor 2 in order to code this app, specifically for Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever done any major coding projects before, so this experience was quite new for us. Despite this, we were determined to create the best app that we could. We used some online resources and input from the mentors in order to learn how to implement new elements into this app and find ways to improve it. We wanted to be able to allow users to take a picture of the food and use Google Vision API to identify the item.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create an app like this in such a short amount of time. We enjoyed making something that can help us and others in our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginner coders, we learned a lot about what goes into creating an app and how to overcome obstacles that we were presented with. We also learned how to create an appealing yet effective user interface and how to work effectively in a team.
                </p>

                    What's next for Grocery on the Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to use Google Vision API to make the experience for users even easier and have more categories to sort the foods into. We want to develop our use of machine learning in order to learn how long it takes for the user to consume a certain product to make the number of days left more accurate.
