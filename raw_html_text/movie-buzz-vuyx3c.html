                    It is a

                        fun and interactive quiz game

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first major challenge was the idea for the game, then I had to rely on how user friendly the data and interesting it should be, finally decided on my favorite hobby -
                    <strong>
                        watching movies
                    </strong>
                    . 
There were few technical challenges to ensure the app passes through the certification which was a challenge.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I love movies, I need to build a proper icon and improve the game with additional features and keep it relevant and informative.
