                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an apartment is a slow and tedious process. But what would happen if we applied the latest innovations in image recognition, socially engaging techniques and machine learning? That's how we came up with guatajaus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds your perfect home based on a personalized recommendation brought to you with TypeForm technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the user data collection with TypeForm, we process the data on the web with a backend based on Django running on Heroku, we cache the results with Sqlite. When all of that information is ready to be served we use an application built with Angular to make the best matching possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular was kind of hard to integrate with TypeForm, and we couldn't do much to deal with it. We also ran with Heroku, which posed some extreme challenges on the processing and efficiency of our system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to built a proof of concept of a possible real-world app based on some of the most modern technology stacks available and fully extensible and profitable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work as a team, to take the falls when things don't go as expected, to properly asses the difficulty of even the simplest tasks... Because at the end of the day everything we've learnt about Angular is pretty important, but what's more important is the ability to push ourselves further and work as a team, because none of us could have done this individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for guatajaus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This fully extensible system can be modularized, can increase in features -ability to look at more images, to contact the owner, to read a description, improve our heuristics-... We see ourselves pushing the limits of this technology further.
