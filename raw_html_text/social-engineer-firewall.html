                <p>
                    No matter how secure your code is, the biggest cybersecurity vulnerability is the human vector. It takes very little to exploit an end-user with social engineering, yet the consequences are severe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practically every platform, from banking to social media, to email and corporate data, implements some form of self-service password reset feature based on security questions to authenticate the account &ldquo;owner.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people wouldn&rsquo;t think twice to talk about their favourite pet or first car, yet such sensitive information is all that stands between a social engineer and total control of all your private accounts.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Social-Engineer Firewall (SEF) aims to protect us from these threats. Upon activation, SEF actively monitors for known attack signatures with voice to speech transcription courtesy of SoundHound&rsquo;s Houndify engine. SEF is the world&rsquo;s first solution to protect the OSI Level 8 (end-user/human) from social engineer attacks.

                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SEF is a Web Application written in React-Native deployed on Microsoft Azure with node.js. iOS and Android app versions are powered by Expo. Real-time audio monitoring is powered by the Houndify SDK API.
