                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build a simple telegram bot that has practical uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The telegram bot takes in location queries from users and responds with the weather and temperature of the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and the Telegram and Open Weather Map APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to understand the Google API, hence, we had to change to using the Open Weather Map API due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a telegram bot which is for practical use and taps on existing APIs. This is our first time working with APIs so it was a very good learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt to operate the Open weather Map APIs and how telegram bot works with the server and users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to extend it to a web front end by using the common back end. As for now, our telegram chat bot is working on the local server, we want to use Heroku to allow the bot to be working even when we are not running it locally on our computer.
