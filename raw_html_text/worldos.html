                    Screens surround us every step of the way. Not only in our homes, but also in public. You can see ads in shopping malls, information screens in tourist centers, TVs in gyms. On every one of these screens is generic content designed to reach out to as many people as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe we can personalize this content for people passing by these screens.  In the end, every device connected to the internet can specifically serve your needs. It can show you content generated specifically for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We add QR codes to public screens. When you scan the code with your mobile &amp; login with Facebook, we adjust the screen based on your likes and interests. This concept can also work when connecting other services like Google, Airbnb or Uber. Practically, a graphic on the screen changes. For example: &ldquo;ZARA has new spring collection&rdquo; is a generic message. &ldquo;Hi, Jerry! These are pieces of cloth you might like based on your preferences. Use these discounts&rdquo; is more personal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into technical challenges like connecting our MVP to Facebook. We figured it eventually. Other than that there is user experience problem. Public screens showing your data is obviously very sensitive matter. There is a need for a data classification and remote screen control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have designed examples of use and developed event recommendation system based on your Facebook preferences. We also developed a way to change any screen connected to the internet by scanning its QR code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to work further on this concept. We might present this MVP to a number of organizations and retailers having screens in their properties attended by tho public.
