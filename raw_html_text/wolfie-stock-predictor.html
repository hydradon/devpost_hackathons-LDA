                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automated trading has been a growing sector since special machine learning algorithms have developed like SVM, Random Forests which have high p-value for predictions and also are really great in identifying and incorporating seasonal and cyclical trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This motivated me to leverage advanced plotly visualizations to view time series graphs and make predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My code uses Blackrock and Google Finance API to collect stock price data of S&amp;P 500 companies by identifying them from Wikipedia.com. I analyze Volatility data and verify the time-series graph with Price data. Finally, I have deployed some machine learning algorithms to predict the stock price data for companies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I used Anaconda package for coding in Python. Anaconda provides a great interface which compiles into Markdown for ease of access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used Blackrock's Aladdin Performance API to get volatility data and stock price data for more than 10 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        using libraries like Matplotlib, Graphlab, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Request, CSV, I created data visualizations and predicted values.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There were quite a few challenges as I struggled with date formats after making the query and also converting the text data to JSON and then JSON data to csv.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, since the examples were in Jquery, I had to figure out all the functions and data types returned by myself.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using google finance and Blackrock's Aladdin library, I was able to verify that volatility curve is very similar to stock pricing graph
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how volatility data is a better predictor for automated stock trading as Risk of buying a share worth $100 will be very different from a $10 share.
                </p>
