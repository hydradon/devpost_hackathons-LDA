                    Our inspiration comes from find some sick deals locally where shipping is not a thought on the mind.

                    All you do is just look through categories, or search if you want, on items by your nearby university and make offers on an item. This in no way binds you to paying for that item. If a seller likes your initial offer, they may start a conversation with you to discuss price and how to pick up the item. It's that easy!

                    The biggest challenge we ran into was time. There are tons of features we would love to implement, but did not have the time. Overall the app still looks as fresh as daisy.

                    We built an entirely functional app! That's pretty sick if you ask me.

                    We have tons of ideas for Expo, but for starters we would want to build an Android version of the app. This would be too hard since most of the app is build on the backend.
