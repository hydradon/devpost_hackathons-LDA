                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Why are there so few entry level resources about silicon?
                    </strong>
                    People hear about silicon products a lot but they never get to know much about it. As students from E.E and BME, my friends and I decided to make a small game to give people a brief introduction about the production and applications of silicon.

                    This little game, named the
                    <em>
                        Silicon Journey
                    </em>
                    , is a rather cute game that simulates the process from silica to silicon. People can play this game and easily get through the technical process and grab the gists of the silicon industry.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have three people in the team and all of us are first time hackers. We were thrilled to present the production process through game. Due to the limited time, we only presented the most simplified steps: the production of raw silicon and the purification of raw silicon. 
We also divided our work: one of us is in charge of the code, one in charge of the graphics, and one in charge of the words. 
RK - introduces the knowledge of silicon production and does all the paperwork ^_&lt;
Alice - our talented artist who draws amazing pictures!
Agnes - puts things together into a game!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, none of us has many experiences with code. We switched between different game makers and finally decided on the rpgmaker. Everything went well afterwards.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a great artist, so our game has a fantastic user interface design and is appealing to people from all ages and all majors - super friendly to people who know nothing about silicon.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork requires effective communications. Frustration is inevitable sometimes, but it&rsquo;s always important to overcome the obstacles together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Silicon Journey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we&rsquo;ve only finished the first stage of silicon production, we&rsquo;ll go deeper into the industry and expand on the numerous purposes and products of silicon. We will also add some detailed information about the different side products and by products and how people deal with them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We also need to make the package smaller, since right now it&rsquo;s way too large that we cannot even submit onto the hackathon :(
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please look forward to the continued journey in the future!
