                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being too busy to properly track our diets, we wanted an easy and conventional way to eat healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foodograph is designed to let you take a photo of every meal you eat, at which point the app detects what major food groups occur on your plate. Every day, your list of food groups gets reset - your goal is to make sure you cross them all off every single day by eating diverse and snapping photos! It takes less than a minute, and you can even check out food photos from around the globe in the social tab!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built as a web app designed to eventually be ported to a webviewer for both Android and iOS. Lots of css and some javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally everything. We didn't get the server we wanted to go live, so we resorted to hosting on GitHub instead. We also completely messed up the Clarifai API despite hours of attempts to get it right. We ultimately had to retreat from the mission (rather than hard coding a fake solution).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We rallied as a team during the last night and pulled through to make something both useful and valuable. We are proud of that, and see value in a company based on an app such as ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to starting a company, you need to know where you are strong and exactly where you are weak. Then, you gotta be as resourceful as humanely possible to meet your goals. #Hack

                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodograph
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rapidly scaling into the fitness industry in full in the next 2-4 months. Potentially attracting the attention of notable investors, such as Ashton Kutcher.
