                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    5G will change the world as we know it. Unprecedented latency and data capacity will have far-reaching socio-economic impacts. 5G requires massive investments in novel infrastructure. If these investments are optimized, we will reap the benefits of this technology (1) faster, (2) cheaper and (3) with more public support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using LIDAR datasets (alternatively satellite imagery), signal attenuation models and perspectively detailed information regarding existing (fiber) infrastructure, we reduce the number of antennas needed to provide 5G to urban areas and optimize their positions. We estimate we can reduce the number of antennas per square kilometer from 25 to 20. In the 100 most densely populated urban areas of Germany, this reduction alone would result in 2.3 bn EUR reduced investment costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, for our customers, the companies having auctioned 5G frequencies, we provide names and phone numbers of people potentially willing to accept antennas on their property. This segmentation is achieved using solvency indices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modelling of beam expansion and signal attenuation with respect to the relevant frequency bands, absorption and reflection spectra was achieved by a comprehensive literature review. LIDAR data were extracted using a number of tools including Java, R and python. For the optimization, mainly tensorflow and openCV were utilized; the whole optimization solution is packaged into a web app built with Python, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The optimization problem is a non-trivial one. A working prototype was achieved. However, we believe that there is further potential to be tapped. The lack of available LIDAR datasets could hypothetically be overcome by using Low Earth Orbit high resolution remote sensing satellites (e.g. from planet.com); this is, however, outside the scope of this project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved a business case with the potential to save several billions of EUR in Germany alone. The concept is completely scalable to 5G roll-outs worldwide.
