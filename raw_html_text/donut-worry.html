                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to know all the options I had with all the ingredients available so that I could optimize my grocery spending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's supposed to return a list of recipes that can be made with user's input based on ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend: nodejs to parse through raw json data;
Frontend: HTML5 and CSS3 ;
Donut Logo and background: Adobe Illustrator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having trouble waking up on Sunday lead to less work time on the project. In addition to that, implementing node.js and pushing through everything in 24 hours were very challenging. We have yet to add all the features we want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the very least, we made a working website with basic functionality of our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there's a whole lot of unaccounted bugs that you might run into when building a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Donut Worry

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our backend remains buggy so we must fix and improve our search function
                    </li>
                    <li>
