                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starbucks has a fairly large turnover in terms of new employees (65% in the U.S.). Each time they train a new employee, they can waste anywhere from 4-6 gallons of milk per trainee. Over time this adds up. Hopefully, by introducing new employees to the Starbucks environment in VR and allowing them to get familiar with the machinery will reduce the amount of wasted resources and decrease training time. This would be beneficial for Starbucks from a cost standpoint and the environment for less wasted resources.
