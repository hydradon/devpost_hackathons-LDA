                    I believe that employers asking new hires about starting pay, ironically, allows the employer to take advantage of their employees. Ask too high and a job applicant will be rejected. Ask too low and a job applicant will be taken advantage of. This causes unfair pay discrepancies between employees, most notably contributing to the ongoing debate about the gender pay gap. This program is meant to take numerical data to decide a new hire's starting pay.
