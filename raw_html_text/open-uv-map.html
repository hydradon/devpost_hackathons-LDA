                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from finding a practical solution to address changes in UV radiation in a user's given area. UV radiation can tell us more about environmental problems such as global warming and also help us take better steps towards prevention of DNA damage.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that takes in input from a UV radiation sensor that is connected to an Arduino 101 board. With this input, we were able to display a chart of the UV radiation measurements over a given span of time. In addition to the chart, we also have a map of locations where the sensors are reading the input from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of technologies from hardware to software for this project. For the hardware portion of the project, we utilized a UV radiation sensor which was connected to an Arduino 101 board. The input from the Arduino board was sent to our Node server hosted in Microsoft Azure. We also utilized Azure maps to create markers for locations our sensors were in. Last but not least, we utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the display for both the map of locations and the chart displaying the changes in UV radiation over time.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into included soldering the wires to the sensor, creating the Node server on Azure, figuring out how to post data from the Arduino, and creating location markers based on data we collected from the server.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we finished with a minimum viable product. We are also happy to say that we have incorporated both hardware and software in our project rather than using only software.
