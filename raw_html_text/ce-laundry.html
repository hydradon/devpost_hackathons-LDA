                    Trying for best freshmen hack and most socially useful hack.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming back after a long horrible day to drenched laundry / Laundry gone with the wind
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checks data.gov.sg for weather conditions. Utilises openCV to measure amount of movement. RaspberryPi SSHes into an EV3 controller, and moves the rack in/outdoors, and rolls the blinds up/down. Notifies users via email when laundry has been shifted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting openCV to run on a potato RPi, getting locked out of twitter api, NOT HAVING A MONITOR/KEYBOARD to program the pi with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying up till 6am, getting openCV to run on a potato computer, interfacing RPi with EV3 through SSH. Spending money to buy the necessary components also gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bring a monitor and a keyboard if you want to use a RPi.
