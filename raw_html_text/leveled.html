                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to find food in Boston, I read a tweet from someone at Lambda School. He had a student that was so promising that he was willing to pay their first month's salary to get a company to take them on. There was more to the arrangement, but the power behind someone putting their money where their mouth is was interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, I don't know many people that have someone who can just throw down a few thousand dollars on their behalf. But we do have our communities.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walked through a full design and development sprint. Starting with user personas and validated learning through interviews with both companies and potential candidates. We made journey maps for all stakeholders and then moved into low-level prototypes. We used Elixir and Phoenix, hosted on Heroku, using Cloudinary for image storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a lot to build in 12 hours.

                <p>
                    This went from a vague idea to a reasonable business model and MVP in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet is a never-ending series of forms. And you don't need React.

                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe putting some polish on this, doing some marketing and taking it to market. We've already done a little bit of market research and this seems to cover a niche in hiring.
