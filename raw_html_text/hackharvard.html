                    Bunch of students who have basically no web experience whatsoever cobble together a little web application over the weekend for Hack Harvard 2016 - waypaver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    waypaver detects the presence points of interests (which are tourist attractions or places for food) along a path between two points. The user then has options to add any of these additional points to their road trip, and a new path (with new attractions!) is automatically drawn for them.

                <h2>
                    How it's built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figured that now is a good of a time as any to try our hand learning some web dev stuff, and we're all pretty decently proud of what we've made. Built using good ol' JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we also tried out the Google Maps, Geonode, Routes api's (and a few more) Can check it out on our GitHub!
                </p>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time and work management - making sure that group members aren't doing the same thing at the same time. Learning basically a whole new area of development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Also, getting our domain up and running was a total nightmare: our account was insufficiently privileged to actually edit the site, and we spent a large amount of time tussling with staff and support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned

                <p>
                    A lot. A whole lot.
