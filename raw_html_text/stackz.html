                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need for simple education for those wanting to learn data structures without all the egregiously boring documentation online. Also, for those struggling with understanding the language online due to a language barrier, tis program provides a no-bias solution to computer science education.

                    How I built it
                </h2>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaFX is not a great way to build visuals. I was recommended to use other languages but I wanted the challenge.
