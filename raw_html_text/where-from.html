                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the Philippines, where human trafficking is a big problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought that there ought to be something like the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch app (which can tell consumers which seafood is fished/farmed sustainably), but for products (which will tell consumers which products were produced ethically).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can scan a product.  The web app compares the product to what we have in the database of products that MAY be the result of labor trafficking.  If the product is something that MAY be the result of labor trafficking, it will show people alternate options.
                </p>

                    We got data from:

                    We use a Rails API, jQuery, the Google API for logo recognition.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should have agreed on which version of Rails &amp; Ruby to use first before we started, because that gave us a lot of errors at first.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to work very well together and all of us got along really well.  We learned new things, and challenged ourselves with learning new APIs that we didn't use before.  Also, our web app looks like a good prototype.

                    Expand the database, add more features, add translations to other languages.
