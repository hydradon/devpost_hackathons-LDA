                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have tried different symptoms checker mobile apps, but current there is none that could automatically identify the human features and provide possible symptoms from the human image picture itself. What if we leverage the power of Azure Cognitive Service and Azure Search to extract human features (face landmarks, gender and etc...) to quickly provide symptoms and learn about our conditions in a matter of seconds.
                </p>

                        SympMD
                    </strong>
                    is your daily mobile health symptoms checker. By just taking a selfie, the app will able to provide all possible symptoms based on the generated age and gender from azure cognitive computer vision service. From the selected symptoms, it will able to provide you all possible health conditions that may you currently experience. Also, it will able to provide you all the know-hows about your selected health condition. Also, it has a "Discover Alternative Medicine" feature wherein you could discover different medicinal usage of some plants/herbs by just uploading a picture of it.
