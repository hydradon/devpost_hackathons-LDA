                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deep Learning is powerful - Deep RL can solve real complex stochastic problems and we wanted to show a proof of concept that Deep RL can be used with Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have a look at the G-Drive. There are a lot of moving cogs (especially with Spatial OS)!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Come around to our table and we'll be happy to tell you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpatialOS - Spent a lot of time trying to get C++ workers to work. Made great headway but couldn't quite make it all compile due to errors with C++ Tensorflow API. Code works in part although integration has been very difficult due to the novel nature of all the software packages we were using
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to create a complex Deep-RL architecture that trained successfully on a Unity simulation. We also got the (notoriously difficult) Tensorflow C++ API to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deep RL + Spatial OS + Unity is a powerful combination that can be used to train complex AIs in a scalable manner in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpatialRL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More research. More layers. (Much) More hyperparameter tuning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But more seriously, we want to dive in more into multi-agent problems with more complex simulations because we believe there is a lot of scope in this area!
