                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're teenagers, so almost by definition, we're broke and want pocket money. This app offers a friendly interface for teens and other willing parties to make a little money while also helping homeowners get on-demand, cheap service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Uber, users submit a request to be picked up and driven, a service. Hire Me takes this idea of on-demand, cheap service, and expands that to every services - whether that be fixing a computer, moving a couch, or mowing the lawn. Using Tinder's swiping system to match potential workers with job providers, sorting potential jobs by distance from workers. Finally, once a secure connection has been established, Hire Me allows workers and job-providers to text and call each other to confirm their transaction.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built entirely in swift with a Parse back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had worked with Parse before, and while we lucked out that Parse was intuitive, there was a little bit of a learning curve there, which hindered our ability to complete all our desired features in time. Another challenge we ran into was that we did not compartmentalize successfully. At previous hackathons, we had created a pipeline and assigned tasks at the very beginning. However, we did not have a concrete idea coming into the hackathon this time and so had to spend the time we usually would dividing up labor on hashing out the idea. This lead to problems in time allocation and confusion as to who was doing what.
