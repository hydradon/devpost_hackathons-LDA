                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a personal trainer is expensive, upwards of $50 an hour. Lots of people want to learn how to work out and lift, but have a huge barrier to entry because of the steep learning curve. We wanted to allow people to get lifting advice even if they didn't have anyone to lift with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This piece of hardware allows people to look at their lifting form through the perspective of a highly sensitive piece of hardware.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled an inertial measurement unit to get gyroscopic and accelerometer readings. We streamed that via Bluetooth to a server to our API to leverage the power of data vizualation.
