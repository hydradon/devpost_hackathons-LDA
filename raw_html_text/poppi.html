                    The Problem: 
Have you ever wondered who the actor/actress was behind the character they played in a movie? Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen them once before, or maybe twice, and became curious about their name or other relevant movies they were cast in?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Solution: 
Well, we have a solution to this. Our android app can allow you to take a picture or a screenshot of this mystery celebrity and run it through a facial recognition API, returning the name and relevant features of this star, including other movies and a basic biography. This allows for you to get search results fast without having to go through the laborious process of searching through the whole movie cast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technical Hurdles: 
Some technical hurdles we experienced were the multiple functioning difficulties of Android Studio, as well as the APIs we implemented. From connecting to the computer vision microsoft API, as well as the films API, to converting the file to the right form and setting the correct headers to the POST. We also encountered a hurdle when trying to save the image in the device after taking the picture so we could scan it through the the facial recognition procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future: 
Our goals for the future of this app include finding and implementing a better API, as the time it takes to run the picture through the computer vision microsoft API can be a lengthy wait. We are thinking of adding more features to the celebrity profile it displays after you feed the app a picture, such as relevant actors/actresses they might&rsquo;ve filmed a movie with. This would all be displayed in an organized, modern day design.
