                    We had seen several similar attempts of utilizing different electronic systems as controllers and wanted to make a somewhat realistic approach through a unique integration of controllers.

                    The collection of programs allows the user to play a first person shooter game, Counter Strike GO, using a Dance Dance Revolution pad for directions and a toy replica gun for aiming and firing. The player has to step in the given directions to walk in game, as well as other functions like jumping. By roughly simulating real movement and a real aiming system, this adds a realistic and more active element to the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the movement, we utilized  a keyboard emulator to connect the pc to a Dance Dance Revolution pad with four directional inputs as well as a jump pad and a few other buttons to navigate the menu in game. For the aiming system we installed an Xbox Kinect sdk and tracked the position of weapon to aim the weapon in the game creating a realistic simulation. For the firing mechanism, we took apart the toy gun installed a small electronic button behind the trigger which we wired to an Arduino which was wired to the PC. This allowed us to utilize the "click" function in the game to execute the fire command via the trigger.

                    Several challenges we faced included the Kinect sensor being very sensitive which caused a lot of trial and error. We also had planned to use a pair of wireless Bluetooth connected Arduinos for the firing mechanism however we lacked the necessary hardware and were forced to wire the mechanism directly to the PC via an Arduino to USB. We also has planned to add a reloading function via a voice command system but ran out of time.

                <p>
                    We were proud to make a system that is somewhat realistic with a reasonably accurate aiming system as that took the longest to calibrate and configure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We primarily learned further uses of C code as that is what the majority of the coding for the Arduino required.  personally also learned a lot with the various hardware experimented such as Arduinos and raspberry pi's, even though the pi's were not used in the final project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With more time and resources in the future we plan to clean the system up overall, integrating more hand gestures into the Kinect system as well as implementing the voice command system using Google Voice AIY kit for a raspberry pi.  This would open up our "controller" to many more control possibilities and executions. We believe using these would further make the control system much more realistic and easier to navigate, all for a relatively low price.
