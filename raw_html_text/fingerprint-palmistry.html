                    Fortune telling is fun because of the illusion of accuracy it creates. We thought we'd go a step further and introduce technology to add to that illusion.

                    This Matlab script takes the pictures the Synaptics fingerprint sensor produces, and analyzes your thumbprint. Using an image analysis technique known as cross correlation, it measures the similarity of your print against ten base types. Based on which types your print resembles most, it tells you your fortune, as well as how accurate the fortune is likely to be (based on how much the print resembled the type compared to others).

                    With Matlab, its Image Processing toolbox, and the synaptics fingerprint sensor.
