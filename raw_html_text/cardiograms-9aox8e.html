                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My long-term goal was to predicted heart attacks or other fatal heart disease days before they occur. I didn't want anyone else to go through what I went through when my  grandmother, unexpectedly, died from a heart attack
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have created several ways that humans could visualize raw data from ECG scans of patients with different heart conditions, so we could understand the data and perform data analysis and predictive analytics to avert these conditions to patients as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used online forums like stack overflow and referred to the documents that my mentor provided me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sometimes the program didn't work. But the semantic error was the hardest to fix like sometimes the visualization was just way off.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cardiograms
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding the best way to utilize data analysis and then using predictive analytics, so these methods could be implemented on IOhTs like wristbands that could gather data through pulse rate that not only patients but everyone could wear.
