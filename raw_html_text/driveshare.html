                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as students, especially those without cars, rely on carpools to take us to events around the area. However, sometimes, it is not possible for us to obtain rides due to scheduling or location conflicts. Thats were DriveShare steps in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DriveShare allows users to plot all the different locations for their carpool members, and plots the optimal path for them to take to reach their destination in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the google maps api, we obtained geographical data regarding our waypoints and created an algorithm that takes the distance into account in order to obtain the fastest possible route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to obtain route information, specifically the time it would take to reach each waypoint, however, we were unsuccessful in implementing that into our route determining algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully solve the Travelling Salesman Problem for our bounds, which is nontrivial. We also were able to synchronize our asynchronous calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PhP is not the ideal login solution.
JQuery is nontrivial to implement.
Asynchronous calls interfere with synchronous tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DriveShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement a solution using real-time data from google, specifically taking into account traffic trends and time taken to travel a specific database. We would also like to add directions in the future to make it more user-friendly. Since it currently an HTML and Javascript based web application, we would like to port it to mobile evices to make it more accessible.
