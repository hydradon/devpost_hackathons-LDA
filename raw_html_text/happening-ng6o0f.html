                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student in University of Maryland College Park, we always see and hear lit events all around campus to DC and the whole DMV area!. So we decided to create a web application that can help up us track these events and promote events that we will possibly host!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does is simple! It's the fusion of Instagram and Tinder, but with events! All users will have access to the same newsfeed which features events near by! If they are interested with the event they see, they simply hit the "like" button and this event goes directly to their profile. This way users will be able to keep track of the events the "liked."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty straight forward, we started doing the backend by designing our database using MYSQL as the database and PHP for communicating with the database. From there on we step by step added features in the web app and finished by designing every page of the app with simple CSS and JS tricks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides the wifi, we do not have enough experience with JavaScripT/Json/Jquery in order to do task that feed data from JS to PHP to MYSQL, so we were stuck for hours trying to do such task such as feeding images and our "like" feature, but we were then able to find a way without using such languages for that specific task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from not having a google api, everything that we planned from scratch were met! We also were able to finish sooner than we thought and had time to make the website more endearing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I do not need the internet as much as we thought we do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Happening
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand more with this web app and add more features such as, adding google maps and calendar api. We are also planning on adding statistics of events - how much people came and a 5 star ratings feature. We would also have "follow" feature - users will have the chance to follow other users and see which events they are interested on going or "like".
