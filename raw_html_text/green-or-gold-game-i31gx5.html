                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Environment changes and pollution bring serious issues to this planet. Governments and some organizations try so hard to inform people about the importance of pollution control and environmental sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, in some area, some people are still trying to make more profits by polluting the surrounding environment of their factories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from this fact. We tend to advocate environment protection. The main idea we want to express is that the damage we made to the environment is irreversible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of the game is to stay alive. The sum of years the earth exists and money a gamer own (only have a very weight) will be the result. The bigger the result is, the more successful you are. You can build factories to own money, but it will increase the emission of CO2 and pollute the air etc, which will shorten the life of earth. To make the earth live longer, you can put your money in afforestation and wastewater treatment, which will slow down the pace of destroying the earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter how much money you own, you will end up dying because of the irreversible damage you have made to the earth. So please protect the environment for ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using the Unity 3D game engine. In the 24 hours of HackRPI, we designed UI and mechanisms of this game. UI includes models, texts, and buttons in the game. Game mechanisms we designed are some mathematic equations that define the relationship between pollution, HP of the Earth, and gold the player has. All scripts are written in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge we have is none of us is an experienced game developer. Two of us did not have any experience using the Unity engine and programming in C#. So, in the 24 hours of HackRPI, we had to learn to use the game engine and C# grammar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge is the game mechanism design. 24 hours are enough for building the structure of the game, but not enough to have a well-designed game mechanism that looks very reasonable and precise and is able to catch user's interest for a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we did not have any background in game development, I am impressed that we can make such a game in 24 hours. I have a clear understanding of the Unity 3D engine and programming in C# now. And the game actually looks very nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Experience in game development. Use of the Unity 3D game engine. Programming in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green Or Gold Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing we may do is to rework the game mechanism. If we can have well-designed mathematical formulas, the game will be much more interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we plan to add an online feature that allows friends to compete their game score.
