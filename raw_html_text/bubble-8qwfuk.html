                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite have the ability to see what our old acquaintances are up to through various social media platforms, we likely miss many real-life connections because we are unaware with where people are in the real world. We wanted to solve that problem by creating an application that would alert the user when one of their friends has entered their bubble, prompting the two of them to meet up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app creates a visual map of your social network. Users appear as pins on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized facebook API for the user base and firebase API for the location tracking to build the app. It is strictly an iOS app that was coded in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we have coded in Swift, so there was a steep learning curve. We were unable to do the back-end development of building out the database of users, so we can't really test our application yet. There are still a few tweaks we need to make
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came out of the weekend with a wealth of knowledge that we didn't have prior. We created an application in a language that none of us were familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some useful techniques for iOS development. The mentors were extremely helpful in getting us over some rough patches. We learned that sometimes it's not best to divide and conquer when you can't bring the two pieces together seamlessly at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bubble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to build out the remaining features of the app. Each user will be grouped into their closest metropolitan area, and not displayed as a single pin on the map. When a user has a friend enter their bubble that is not normally from the area, they will receive a push notification encouraging them to meet up.
