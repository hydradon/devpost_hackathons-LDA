                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After struggling for a few hours on a project well out of my depth. I stormed out of the building and headed back to main campus. As the wind blew the snow right through my sweater, I realized I needed a coat and a new project idea. The idea came to me somewhere between 30th and the math building.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Its a blog to chronicle my experiences at this hackathon. As a noob I had a steep learning curve and I felt very insecure in a room of people who all look like they have taken at least one programming class.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the HTML experience I got over winter break learning with codecademy and sheer will to write the code. CSS and I are friends now

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My lack of experience and need to google simple things like how do you add a photo ... then how do you resize that photo! I also struggled to get my code onto a test site. I'm still struggling to get my stuff onto github. that is why my submission is on a crazy URL. If I can figure it out before 12 then maybe I can put it on github.

                    I'm just happy to have something to turn in. Yesterday I was ready to quite and just leave. I felt so out of my depth and lonely with out a team. Now I can say I put in a solid effort
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where I started in December

                    just to show how far I have come and I'm proud of that.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you can make a team with strangers when all your 'friends' don't show up- Do it. I had a really good time, but I think it wouldn't have been so rocky and anxiety filled if I felt like I knew other people there.

                <p>
                    Maybe this is be the landing space for my thoughts as I enter more hackathons and chronicle the experience of getting better at coding
