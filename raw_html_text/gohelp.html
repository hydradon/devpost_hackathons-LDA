                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we went camping together, we would often not know what some camping materials are because we are not too familiar with them. We had trouble finding what spots to visit, so we had to keep going around asking people.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoHelp scans an image and outputs news headlines about the product or about the events happening in the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Xcode, JSON, Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to get the data that was in the picture into news that was related. We also had a hard time setting up json. We ran into many dead ends so we had to trace ourselves back a few steps and work our way around all issues that occurred.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have made an app that can help many people in the world when they go to explore the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even though there are API's included there is still a lot of work that you need to do to get the app running the way you want it.
