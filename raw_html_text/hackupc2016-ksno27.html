                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever think about how to visit cities in a different ways? So now you can do that while having fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple, it's only an app to play while you are make tourism somewhere trying to know the environment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop most of the project with the different tools that it provides. After that, we used another technologies like node.js and API calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to use API's that we never used before and get a different qualities such as learn a lot of git (and crying with the fail merges)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackaton and we could finalize our basic purposes, make an app :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few things about API's for logins in android, how to create and improve a server with an API REST using nodejs (but we didn't had enough time for use it correctly) and also we improved our abilities with android and git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking about going to another way, we learned many things but it is better to create some different stuff like hardware (like drones).
