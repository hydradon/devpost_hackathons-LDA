                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this project by the problem  of
                    <strong>
                        cyber bullying
                    </strong>
                    that impacts many teens and adults today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project works in a manner such that when one says certain negative words, it entices a positive response from Alexa to replace the negative one. One example is saying "you suck" and receiving a response from Alexa saying, "You said 'you suck,' but that was not nice. Instead, try saying 'you rock.'" This command on Amazon Alexa is intended to encourage people to treat others respectfully.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we began by using ifttt.com, but we soon became frustrated with the little freedom given in the application. We discovered a way to write the code on Amazon Web Services, yet we weren't familiar with it, so it was difficult. This led to us adding our fourth team member, Brittany, who expanded our knowledge of Javascript and helped us navigate the website. On the website, we used Amazon's AWS Lambda to write code that detects certain negative words and replaces them with positive antonyms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we began using AWS, it was a struggle to navigate their website and pinpoint errors in our code, but adding a fourth member to our team expanded our knowledge and understanding. We worked together to develop a code to combat bullying, but upon testing the code many errors were found. Finding and correcting those errors was the hardest part, as it took much time and concentration.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make a meaningful project while most of our team were only beginners. We are also proud of our perseverance, especially while debugging the code since that took several hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded our knowledge of Javascript and AWS Lambda. Also, we learned the best ways to approach using Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Combating Cyber Bullying with Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on growing Alexa's ability to detected hurtful words and phrases. This program, after undergoing more development, could eradicate bullying through the use of Amazon Alexa. This would be accomplished by reminding others that there are better phrases to use and to give them a moment to reflect upon what they are about to say. Therefore, making the world a happier place.
