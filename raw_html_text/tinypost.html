                    We were inspired by people who felt like they could not share information about their mental health on traditional social media platforms. We wanted to create a space solely for this purpose. The app provides a forum in which the user can post their current feelings and struggles. Other users can reply with advice and encouraging comments. Users can also use the events tab to see when local events are occurring. There is also a resource tab providing the information of local mental health professionals.
