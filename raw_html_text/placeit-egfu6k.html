                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a fun and easy to use travel related party game application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A two player web based application where both players must guess the allocated point of interest of the other player. This is done through a chat without using any of the words in the place name! Points are added for every correct answer to a scoreboard. We even cleverly educate people by teaching them how to use latitude and longitude!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript; primarily through node.js utilising npm modules such as socket.io, express, nodemon and sass. The Google Places API was used to fetch data about the points of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilising the Google Places API to integrate well with the Socket.io system that was already in place required some thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full implementation of a full chat protocol and deployment of a multi user working application. Also, working efficiently as a team and collaborating well throughout the duration of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing technologies that none of us were previously familiar with ensured that we gained the most out of the project; not only learning how one would produce such an app, but also implementation using new technology tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlaceIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accounts API for permanent user leaderboard. Add levels. Also including better checking of answers and even possibility to answer questions using location (by going there) to gain bonus points!
