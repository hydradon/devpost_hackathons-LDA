                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was written in python using pygame.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to write another controller using a websocket and swift, but it was more trouble than it was worth.
Pygame is supported differently between Ubuntu and OSX. We had to write a bunch of janky stuff to ensure OSX was stable while running the game.

                <p>
                    Our game is playing with both keyboard and xbox 360 controller input.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    First time using pygame, so everything used which was pygame related was learned.
