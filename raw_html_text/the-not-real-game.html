                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A.I. may prove to be the most powerful thing humans have ever invented. Many people are unsure about it or even afraid of it. But also not many people know that A.I. can create interesting and beautiful art. And who doesn't love art?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to make A.I. more accessible through a trading card game where you collect and trade A.I. generated art. Also, the idea of an art discovery/creation marketplace is interesting and unexplored.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Lots of moving parts, with 5 different repos. Lots to take in without context. Great project though.
