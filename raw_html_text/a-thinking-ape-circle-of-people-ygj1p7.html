                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that challenge very interesting for being unique. As back-end developers, many times we don't have to solve mathematical problems like this and is was a great opportunity to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge is to remove every second person in a circle of people and try to guess who is the last.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simulate the problem many times with different number of people and tried to identify a pattern for the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could realize that when the number of people is power of two the last person will be always the first in the circle  and were able to formulate a mathematical function when that number is not a power of 2.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that this is a classic problem in computer science and it was more difficult than we thought at first.
