                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prompt 2- MS (Healthcare)
The strain on caregivers for MS patients and others that are made dependant by debilitating sickness is immense. Lisa aims to be an assistant that can watch when you are not around and identify you when something is wrong based on a deep learning model.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses computer vision and speech analysis to identify when the patient needs assistance or is at risk then notifies the designated caregivers that their attention is required.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built python scripts that use Tensorflow and OpenCV for computer vision intended to run on a raspberry-pi. We built a demo of the application using figma prototyping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm for image analysis was a difficult algorithm to wrap our head around in 24 hours, but eventually we understood it's functionality.
OpenCV documentation was sparse or difficult to to find and made the process quite difficult.
We had a lot of difficulty connecting the raspberry-pi and eventually were unable to use it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using deep learning models for analysis
Using twilio to send texts as alerts
Using figma prototype mode for an interactive experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The constraints of a pre-trained model
The true expense of training a large model (time and computational)
