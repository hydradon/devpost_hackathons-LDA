                    HACK PREMISE: As California has gone through one of the most devastating fires since 2007, it has come to our attention that while most evacuation orders were completed with enough allocated time for a family to collect their belongings and follow emergency guidelines, the ability of individuals to react to fires was unevenly distributed, especially for those with hearing impairments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the deaf community, there is no accessible and portable device that alerts them to a fire, so whenever a deaf person moves into a new apartment or travels, they either have to go through a cumbersome process of alerting the fire department or housing occupants on the nature of their disability or share a room with someone with hearing. Furthermore, as one ages, sense of smell degrades rapidly, making it especially difficult for older occupants to respond in time to fire threats. Currently available alarms that can help, however, such as strobe lights and bed shakers are either very expensive or difficult to set-up in a room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HACK IDEA:
We wanted to build a device that would serve as a portable alarm for the deaf community, and is bluetooth shielded, therefore eliminating the need for internet access. The device detects the acoustical signature of the building&rsquo;s fire alarm (the frequency is standardized by fire code) and sends a notification to an android watch via bluetooth. The watch will then vibrate and alert the owner. Additionally, the device includes a temperature sensor in case of fire in one&rsquo;s personal vicinity while they are asleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we understand that currently on the market there is the Nest Protect, we believe our device will better accommodate users because the device does not require a direct connection to the internet in order to alert users. Furthermore, our device&rsquo;s low-cost components makes it cheaper and more accessible than that of the Nest.

                    EXTENSIONS:
If possible we would like to use a TI Sensor Tag, which includes a more accurate barometer, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and light sensor, in a financially accessible package. We also see another possible extension in attachable wall sensors that can sync with an arduino board to detect changes in air pressure, temperature, and humidity. This would increase the area screened by the arduino and provide for a greater expansion of services, such as gas leak detection.
