                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product is a credit card for those who want to give back. Instead of getting cash back directly to your account, individuals with the TD Spark card get 2% cash back to donate to a social cause. The credit card is designed to have a characteristic look and feel to have a brand that is as impactful as the people who use it.
