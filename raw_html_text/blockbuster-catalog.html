                <p>
                    With BeaverHack's Winter 2018 theme in mind, our team figured that there would be no better-fitting project to submit than a project that "rewinds" the clock and lets users relive the glory days of VHS video rental services, before online streaming became the norm. And, as everyone knows, it's only proper to rewind your videos before returning them to...

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows users to relive the experience of renting movies from BawkBuster (totally not a knock-off of a much better known, and probably trademarked, video rental store).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Search for movies by title, genre, or director from our catalog of over
                    <strong>
                        5000
                    </strong>
                    unique titles!
Users can add the movies to their cart, review the movies they've added to their cart to make sure they have all the movies they want, and even remove movies from their cart (just in case they change their minds).

                    This project is made entirely in c++ (except for the movie data set, which is a .csv file courtesy of

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the information in the movie data set, figuring out menu navigation and integrating the object class' member functions with the menu functions are all challenges that our team overcame over the course of this project.

                <p>
                    We overcame all the challenges in our way to create a working project in time for the demo!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned so much about how to use Git and work as a team using that platform!
With so many different menus that the user requires access to while using the BawkBuster program, this project emphasizes the importance of organizing the project in an easy to follow manner.
