                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a way for users to easy model graphical data (family tree, dependency graphs, etc.) and run queries on it. We planned to use our unification framework to write rules that could be used to provide powerful views of the object graph and write interesting queries. For example, you could define that a grandmother is a female parent of a parent, and then later query for grandmother given parent and gender data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time building the user interface which supports Apple Pencil input for drawing and connecting nodes, and allows for interacting with the graph and rearranging the nodes while they edges provide forces to pull them together. We also built a unification framework to run the logical queries. We unfortunately ran out of time to complete the UI and connect it to the framework, so we ended up with two separate products&mdash;the logic framework and the interactive graph builder.
