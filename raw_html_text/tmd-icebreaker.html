                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our inspiration from web based games such as the Jackbox Party Pack and Kahoot, as these are well loved and very engaging to audiences, something we hope to attain with this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a player to either create a lobby or join a room. Once all the required players are in the room the game can start. A player is randomly selected and has a short time to answer as many questions about themselves as possible. After this they have a set time to explain all about themselves to the other players and to cover the questions they were asked for then once time is up the audience will have to answer the same questions about the person to gain points for each one they get correct. This then rotates for each player in the game and by the end everyone will be well acquainted.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using a mixture of Django with Bootstrap elements in order to create a fleshed out game with a sleek UI. We used a database to save the questions and answers given as well as to save all information on the players such as their score. All of this is hosted on our domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had was getting the domain fully working as this was a problem with connection
                </p>
