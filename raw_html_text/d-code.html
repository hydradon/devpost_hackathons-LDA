                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got my inspiration from teaching my cousin to code. It wasn't until I got started that I realized that there were many aspects to java that required a large learning curve. That was when we decided that we wanted to deconstruct one of the most popular languages and make it simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rather than having to go through the struggles of learning a programming language, we provide a user friendly interface that makes the coding the experience more pleasant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off coding the pseudocode that java interprets and slowly moved on to the UI. Then we moved on to coding concrete example games using the pseudocode. After that we worked on created a descriptive and complete help menu so that the user feels comfortable using the program. Finally we created a index.html to supplement the the program. From the website you can download the program to your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to created a "mesh"/networking ability in our program but ran into difficulties making it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a simpler way to code and interpreting our own "language". We are also happy that the user can interact with a aesthetically pleasing html file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that you can learn and accomplish a lot in 24 hours if you set your mind to it and work really hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for D-Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add networking abilities later and create a well designed website.
