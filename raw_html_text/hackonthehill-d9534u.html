                    So basically, we decided to make an app for anyone to tweet anything to the two most hated presidential candidates in history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Essentially, our web app is linked to an anonymous Twitter account that allows anyone to tweet @ the two candidates. If a user does not know what to say, simply clicking on the tweet buttons w an empty text area will send a random tweet to the candidates for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Underneath, the web app loads two series of tweets with keywords Clinton and Trump. This allows a user to see what other Twitter users have to say about the candidates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is basically a filtered Twitter hub to both express your voice, as well as gain a brief insight into others' opinions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our country is doomed, everyone is split, and the world will end soon. Might as well enjoy hating on our presidential candidates together as one on social media while we can! :)
