                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing each non-profit's presentation, Team HelperUpper decided that the most feasible, and also most exciting project, would be Understanding Poverty's proposal for a "Yelp for Impoverished Individuals".  With backgrounds working on social-impact mobile apps (including a similar project for homeless individuals called Home App), this was the perfect problem for this team to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HelperUpper allows users to access and review resources ranging from Jobs to Non-Profit Help, from Events/Activities (particularly for children) to Coupons/Discounts.  This can be done from clients for both iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is built in Node.js using Express and Firebase.  The frontend is built using React Native, which compiles natively for both iOS and Android.  A variety of libraries, such as AirBNB's react-native-maps, were also utilized.  Our demo server was tunneled through ngrok.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every error imaginable on both sides of the project, both in terms of spelling mistakes and unresolved errors with the compatibility of react-native packages with the current version of react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully-functional live app after hours of being completely lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As always, more about the frameworks and tools that we used, as well as the way apps can be structured for use by potentially non-technical users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HelperUpper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosting the server online, finishing development of Event Maps (dependent on issue resolution of react-native-maps), and beginning public deployment!
