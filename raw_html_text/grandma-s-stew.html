                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thee biggest contributor to health issues in low income populations is simply a lack of proper nutrition.
Basic nutrition becomes a luxury for those who lack money, transportation, and time.
The closest healthy food is a lengthy bus ride; hours away; where you can only bring back what you can carry.
This is not the story of just a handful of people, but is the daily reality of 2.3 million Americans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet Paul.
A 24 year old, waiter from the Bronx.
He eats out 8-10 times a week at places like McDonalds, Taco Bell and 7/11.
That's unhealthy, but what choice does he have.
He's overworked; Underpaid; and does not have a car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meet Rosales.
She's 59
Retired
and lives by Paul.
Unlike Paul, she has free time, and a car.
She loves to cook, and cooks well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect people like Rosales to people like Paul.
People who love to cook, with people who need a home cooked meal.
By doing so, we will help them be healthier.
Telling people they are unhealthy, wont make them change. Giving them a solution will.

                    How it all happened
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an web based mobile app using good ol Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS.
Our backend server is a NodeJS express server, running with mongoDB.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To kickstart the projects we are considering meeting with local pastors to help promote the app.
