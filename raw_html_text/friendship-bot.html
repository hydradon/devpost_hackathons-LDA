                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was an idea given to me by a friend, so I decided that for my first hackathon, I might as well start small and go for something like this.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friendship Bot is a Discord bot that keeps track of when people send messages into a channel in close succession. It interprets that as the two people talking to each other and awards the pair of them friendship points. Each pair of non-but users in a server has their own friendship counter. The bot comes with a few commands to help users use it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot was built using the discord.py api.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided for this project to use an api I had never used before, in a language I had minimal experience with, all while only using Vim as my text editor, which I used for the first time the morning before the hackathon began.

                <p>
                    I made something functional despite the above difficulties
