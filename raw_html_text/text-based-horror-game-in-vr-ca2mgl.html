                    many peoople ask Is vidoe games is art. "text-based horror game IN VR" marries the demonstrably compatible genres of horror and virtual reality -- both of which neatly package the user's sense perceptions -- with an ostensibly incompatible genre, text-based adventure, which relies on the user's imagination to build the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our virtual world is navigated in a first-person context and consists of a game and several other areas to explore. The game is guided by computers stationed in each room that lead further into the maze. Spooky characters and objects populate the maze and 3D text informs the user of their current state. When the user reaches the end of the game, they fall into a magical room that congratulates them on their successful pass through the maze. The additional rooms in our virtual world can be accessed by colliding with objects in the opening scene or in the rooms themselves. They allow for a fun exploration period before the game begins, if the user chooses to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our virtual world using Unity, which we learned to use in a tech talk at the beginning of the hackathon weekend. Our world is made up of downloaded and self-made Unity assets, and c# scripts to control navigation and actions. Testing was made possible by Major League Hacking, which loaned us an Oculus Rift for the hackathon event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was using collisions between the first-person player and objects to trigger navigation between rooms. Another challenge we had was working with the hardware. The Oculus did not work with any mac computers, and none of our PCs met their processing/GPU requirements for high-quality VR. Despite this, we were able to deploy our VR game to the Oculus with a quality that met our standards. Also, basically none of us knew what we were doing.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how design and build a game in Unity and how to create 3D assets in Blender. Megan had used Unity previously for a couple of non-VR games; Betsy had programmed but never used Unity; this was Cal's first hack. Needless to say, our team learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for text-based horror game IN VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we began our dev cycle, the game was mostly easter eggs, the majority of which did not make the final cut. We would like to add these -- a room with a cat chasing a laser pointer, a VR fidget spinner, a jump scare scene, and an iPod interface c. 2005 to match the iPod-like controller for the Oculus -- using Unity's Raycast API to select each scene from the literal easter eggs we have shelved in our home screen.
