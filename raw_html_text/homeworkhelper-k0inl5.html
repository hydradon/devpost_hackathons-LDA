                    Inspiration: On numerous occasions our fellow peers and us have been stuck in a situation where office hours and math tutoring have been inconvenient, unavailable, or their teaching methods were not effective as they could have been. As a result, the idea for this app arose to face the challenge.

                <p>
                    In the beginning the member of this team had no prior knowledge of each other. After getting into the team we found that we had to take time to get to know each other. 
Another challenge we meet was connecting activities that were created to work with each other.
