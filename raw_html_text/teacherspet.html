                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since technology in the classroom is becoming more prominent, every teacher wants to capture the utility of the internet to supplement the learning material available. Hundreds of tools are available for teachers to use for all aspects of education: assignment submission, attendance, file hosting, and deadline reminders. However, this results in hundreds of websites and applications that both teachers and students need to keep track of.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teacher's Pet is a total consolidation of the technology available in the education industry. Teachers are able to have a virtual classroom online by adding homework, files, and assessment dates. Administrative work such as attendance and project collection is also possible. Students are able to access their marks, choose courses for next year, and plan out studying sessions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Calendar API is responsible for the addition and display of events. The website was built with bootstrap and all backend aspects were handled with node.js.

                <p>
                    Making anything work at all.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with more backend, previously working with none before. Also this is Aaron's first hackathon and learned the craft of building websites.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making APIs work is hard when you don't know what you're doing.
