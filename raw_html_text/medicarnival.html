                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the app was combined challenge from Carnival Cruise Line and Express Scripts. We as a team personally would prefer if we could ask for help digitally rather than show up directly to the doctor's office first, especially if we don't know when we'll be seen. We also wanted to encourage crew members and passengers to be more forward with any medical ailments in order to address them more quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The React Native app, which can be deployed cross-platform, allows crew members or passengers to fill out a medical visit form with information such as their name, room number, etc., describe their issue, and request an immediate doctor's visit. From there, a medical staff member currently on-call will receive a notification that there has been a new form submitted and have several options of dealing with the submission such as scheduling a visit, corresponding with the submitter, or resolving the issue remotely. Ideally, this notification would be sent to the safety captain closest to the submitter (determined through access points) to assist them, especially if it is critical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed some mock-ups using Adobe XD, created the front-end of the form in React Native, and worked on connecting the back-end to Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner and I have never touched React Native or Google Cloud Platform before this weekend. Although we've researched it to develop plans for our senior design projects, we had not coded anything in React Native or used the Google Cloud Platform so both the library and technology platform were completely new to us. It was satisfying when we were able to publish some semblance of what we were aiming for but it was extremely challenging to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of creating our first prototype in React Native. We have a group project for our classes in which we will need to use React Native so it feels like we were able to get a jump start on prototyping for that assignment while having fun with our friends at MangoHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the similarities and differences between Google Cloud Platform (which we've never used before) and AWS (which we're familiar with). We also learned some of the syntax used in React Native and how to create forms. We learned about some of the restrictions that belong to attempting to develop for iOS and will be able to apply that to future Hackathons and projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medicarnival
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to become even more adept at React Native, to the point where we feel more accomplished as front-end designers and developers.
