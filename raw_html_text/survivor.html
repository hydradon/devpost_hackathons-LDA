                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an engaging game that inspires the audience to explore different available paths.

                    What it does

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling errors and coding errors with the buttons.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app would crash, and we reconfigured them which made us feel good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Since we're beginners, we learned a lot about coding throughout this experience.
