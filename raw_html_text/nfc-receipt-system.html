                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw a lot of receipt papers being wasted and i realized how long it takes to enter an email or become a member on a store that you visit once a year for an e receipt. NFC Receipt would make things much easier, it'll save paper and make things quicker during checkout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is compatible with Square and it uses NFC to send the final square receipt to another device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Square API and worked on Unity using the C# Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Square API is really badly organized and the specific factors that we needed to overcome were almost impossible due to the way their API is setup. Moreover their Sandbox mode isn't really a real API that we can use for testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the NFC part done, it reads and writes data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned payment gateway APIs and Android development through C# and Unity.
                </p>

                    What's next for NFC Receipt System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably getting things to work properly and maybe having an actual software with a NFC reader(external)
