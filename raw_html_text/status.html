                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the inevitability of fossil fuel supply, our group was motivated to seek a alternative form of electricity and transportation that would remain relevant and innovative in the next century of scientific study.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our new transportation network compares to modern maglev bullet trains utilizing a charged track and a man-made magnetic field, but differs in its energy recycling capabilities. In both systems, the electricity running through the tracks provides the propulsion, but in our invention, the wind produced by reaching speeds upwards of 250mph goes unutilized. In our new design, the train is deployed with side propellers to capture the wind energy during the high speed trips as well as smart glass composed roofs and windows which capture solar energy. These types of energy are converted into electricity stored in an on-board battery. After each trip, the energy from this battery goes towards powering the next trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea consists of a conceptual network, a 3D printed model of a prototype train, and a programmed Lego Mindstorm vehicle representation of the maglev.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into design disagreements based on personal preference and practicality disputes. In adition to this, our 3D model, which we could only print once, was too thin in the wind mill side parts and therefore fell apart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A design like this solves the main problem for the implication of maglevs and can be easily applied of to the conditions of people around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that renewable energy will be vital in a world where old forms of energy/transportation will become outmoded or unavailable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the S.T.A.T.U.S. Train Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, after affecting personal travel, a S.T.A.T.U.S.-like system of industry/manufacturing routes will overtake the outdated rail lines connecting hubs of warehouses, processing facilities, and distribution centers. This would greatly decrease the amount of time necessary for a company to maintain and ship its products as well as enhancing its distribution capabilities.
