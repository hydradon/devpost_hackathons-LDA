                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often, we find that we have questions in class which we don't wish to hold up everyone else for. By having a class chatroom, we can ask our peers and teachers questions and get answers as people are available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can input their class and name, and converse in a group chatroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team worked together with GitHub. I (Peter) worked on the server framework and css, Atharv worked on the login system, and Chris worked on the chatroom proper. We all worked predominantly in javascript and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to connect the login and chatroom functionality, but both are fully functional individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, and we came very close to making a functional webapp with no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use git on windows, some javascript, some html, and integrating our code with existing libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for APC Chat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will work to produce webapps inspired by this, possibly reusing some of the code.
