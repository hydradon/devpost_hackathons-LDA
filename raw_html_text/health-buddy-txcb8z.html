                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first time hacking at a women-centric hackathon, we were inspired to make a web app for women to keep track of their health. The large scope of the project is an app for women to keep track of their daily meals, snacks, and water consumption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Short Describing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calorie tracker that scans bar codes of snacks and recommends snack based on user's health (bmi,bmr).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        node.js, vue.js, visual studio code
                    </strong>
                    We used various platforms to host a site on local server and build a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with syntax as this was our first time coding in javascript so there were a lot of simple tasks features of javascript that we were unaware of. We also learned how to work with various new API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proudest of our scanner feature, and the fact that we were able to figure out how to make a website at all that included different pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the different components that come together when building a web application such as how to implement both frontend and backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to transform Health Buddy into an Android App that tracks meals and water intake as well. We wanted to implement the Nutritionix API so that we could scan the barcodes of products to collect nutrition facts more efficiently.
