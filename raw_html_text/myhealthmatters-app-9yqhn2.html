                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan didn't go as planned and we had this issue that was offered for us to help with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application works for android phones and provides the MyHealthMatters participants fun, work-appropriate, sedentary disruption activities such as exercises to do.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to use the Android Studio platform with java programming.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first project that we came up with did not work out so we had to come up and a new game plan on the fly.
