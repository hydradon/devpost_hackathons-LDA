                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are High School Sophomores attending the Academies of Loudoun and John Champe High School. We designed this application to help prevent further damage to our Earth by educating the next generation through the use of fun, web-based games.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It currently has two addictive games; the first is called Bag Blaster and the second is called Hoo Hops. Both are unique video games with different dynamics, however, once your character dies in order to respawn, the user has to answer questions regarding the environment. We also have a Google Home application and an Android app which helps provide interactive gameplay where ever you are.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application starts off with an index.html page, this page essentially contains two buttons to redirect you to the game of you're choosing. The two games contain their own HTML and JavaScript components. Essentially the HTML creates a canvas/some buttons and text for the JavaScript to manipulate.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Bag Blaster, the canvas was a set site, however, with Hoo Hops, I wanted a full-screen environment. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to set a full-screen canvas. Another problem I ran into was with domain.com, I was initially going to use that for the domain, and use their website making feature to make my index.html page look more lively. However, because many people at HooHacks were using domain.com, domain.com believed that anyone from this network was a bot thus failed to give me the domain. So instead I am using GitHub Pages

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned from above, the full-screen canvas took a lot of time, however, in the end, I was able to grind it out. Also, I never pulled an all-nighter, this was my first time and I'm honestly glad coffee exists.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been coding in Java for the last four years, however, I recently realized that Java doesn't support web-based development as JavaScript does. So just last week, I learned JavaScript. All the JavaScript in this project was all written by me, without any form of copy and paste or any need to reference basic documentation. In addition, I learned how to tie together multiple HTML pages together.

                    What's next for EcoSave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add in more games, we take our purpose of enlightening the future generations about the negative ways Humans have been taking advantage of the environment for too long, and it is our goal to reduce that.
