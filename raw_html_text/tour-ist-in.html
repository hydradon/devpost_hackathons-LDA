                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ingolstadt is well-known in Germany as well as in other countries for many reasons. The headquarter of the huge german car manufacturer AUDI AG is located here, we have a special history including the illuminates and Frankenstein and the "Reinheitsgebot" was published here in 1516. Therefore we wanted people to get in touch with Ingolstadt and learn about its history.
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    will give you opportunities to gain information about different places in Ingolstadt. You can use functions to search for specific topics or get an inspiration about buildings or similar things in your direct area. After this the user has the possibility to get a direct link to Google Maps, which includes a suggested route to the next point of interest.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialogflow to implement all the functions for
                    <strong>
                        Tour.ist.IN
                    </strong>
                    , which will include the detection of your current location, information about places as well as an option to let you guide to the next station by Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the implementation of the detection/permission of the location is not possible within Dialogflow. We tried a lot and even asked members of the Google team to help, but we still get strange error messages (library problems).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to Dialogflow was pretty hard at the beginning and we had a lot of problems with the location detection. But as even the professional Google members could not fix it, this was a great achievement for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Google Assistant and even about actual use-cases, that we did not know. Also we got to know the development area Dialogflow, which was really interesting. Even as totally new beginners we learned many functions.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The location detection has to be implemented after the problem will be fixed by Google. Then we want to include even more points of interest. We would like to include beer types as well as bars and restaurants, which are special for Ingolstadt to give the user a great overview.
