                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app using node.js and HTML, learning together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud how our team rose to the challenge of quickly learning Javascript and node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Javascript and node - this was a new language for some of our team members.
                </p>

                    What's next for Packed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll add more specific location-aware features - like suggesting to pack flip flops if you're traveling close to a beach or coast.
