                <p>
                    Today&rsquo;s Icelandic system of getting a driver's license is really outdated. Every student gets a paper book that needs to be taken to every class, lecture and test. This system is extremely inconvenient for students and has often led students to miss tests or lectures if they&rsquo;ve misplaced their book. The student also needs to bring every application to the district administrative officer, with the proper signatures and/or stamps. This process does not appeal to the intended audience as it is slow and complicated which does not motivate the student to continue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is the solution?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is the online driving book. A website that has all your driving education online and is easily accessible. The website will have seperate views and functionality for teachers and students, while the student-data will also be accessible to any third party that might need to verify completion, like Frumherji, samg&ouml;gnustofa, police and the district administrative officer. This eliminates any unnecessary trips around the city and makes processes easier for everyone involved. The teacher will be able to fill in all information about the students lessons and the student can see all the progress he has made along with taking mandatory lectures like driving school 1 and 2. We want to incorporate a system on the site that would function like a mini-game. The user would acquire artificial points, coins and trophies, and level up, all in the process of getting their licence, for example after each driving lesson. We think that this would motivate the user on finishing the whole process in a reasonable time, in an interactive and enjoyable way.
