                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us didn't have much experience with lower level hardware integrations, so we decided it would be fun to dabble with something like this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our car broadcasts its own SSID so it acts like a router which anyone can connect to. When you're connected, you can control the car that's running Node.JS with GPIO integration to control the vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we decided to collect data on drivers to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to see how well we could get the vehicle to drive on its own for a given task (be it following a track or avoiding objects.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bought two RC cars at WalMart, some RPis and breadboards and went to town. We followed a tutorial online to get it up and running with python - and then ported the code over to Javascript on a Node Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting up the RPis to broadcast their own SSID was a task in and of itself. We had to setup DHCP servers to assign IPs to connecting clients so they could communicate with the Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the Neural Network was a combination of OpenCV for machine vision/image processing and TensorFlow for the NN framework. We ended up having to create a TCP connection and Video Stream between the Pi and a laptop computer as TensorFlow doesn't run on a 32bit architecture. So the Pi would stream video that the laptop would consume, classifying the stream frame by frame - and then sending commands to the Pi - effectively acting as a cloud based decision making platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh were there a ton! For a while we had problems reading data from the Raspberry Pi camera - which took the better half of a day to get working correctly. Beyond that, configuring the Pis to broadcast an SSID ran into several hiccups with the networking connection on campus. We weren't able to download/update node packages for a while - ultimately leading us to have to reformat one of the pis and start from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, after 9 hours of development around the Neural Network - we found out that the Pi couldn't run the code. So we had to create the "cloud based" solution mentioned above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, this project was a great learning experience. We really enjoyed seeing the pieces come together one by one - and we're especially proud of the many different technologies we touched to stand this project up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great learning experience. A major take away was that a sturdy wireless connection is key - and the iterative development pays off!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CyDriver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't have any immediate plans for CyDriver - but it would be very interesting to see how well our vehicle performs on different tasks. Additionally, creating a cluster of pi cars that think collectively would be awesome.
