                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be really difficult to organize a group project (as we experienced yet again in the last 24 hours). Many students prefer the platform GroupMe to message their peers and classmates to work on their group projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tyrone is  bot created in GroupMe to help students plan projects, delegate tasks, keep track of deadlines, among other functions to make group project communication more efficient and organized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a database with sqlite, code to send and receive HTTP requests, an interactive bot "Tyrone", a callback link, and lots of caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many aspects of building the bot that we were not familiar with, so we had to learn them within the 24 hour time span.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of learning all that we did in the short amount of time, and that we finished a quality project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use HTTP requests, how to use JSON, how to convert from Java to JSON (and vice-versa), Heroku, and a better understanding of Github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tyrone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More commands for Tyrone such as better progress tracking, individual task assignment, intelligent AI, and more many more memes.
