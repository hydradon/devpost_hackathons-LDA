                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got tired of our professors pronouncing our name incorrectly and decided to action into our own hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses complex machine learning algorithms and facial detection libraries to associate a name with a person's face, and can also mark them as being present for a class, if a kiosk with our software was set up in the classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using Google's Cloud Platform, python, OpenCV, and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had initially planned on allowing students to be checked in with a mobile device, but OpenCV for Android is not advanced enough to allow this to be possible, so we decided to run it on a laptop instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the facial recognition system fully functional, with zero false positives throughout the duration of our testing was most likely our largest accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an
                    <em>
                        accurate
                    </em>
                    facial recognition system, with consistent results, is more difficult than it seems
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Present!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spending more time, and getting it to fully run on Android devices is something we'd like to take care of, possibly exploring technologies other than OpenCV.
