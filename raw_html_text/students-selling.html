                    We wanted to build a site where students could directly sell their used furniture, clothes, books, etc. to other students.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This website allows for students to sell to other students. It is secure and will require a .edu email address to sign-up. It also will potentially come with a payment method like venmo to make transactions easy and secure.
