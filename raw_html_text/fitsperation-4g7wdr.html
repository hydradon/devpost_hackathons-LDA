                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students with busy schedules and tons of problem sets to get through, it's easy to forget to take a step back from the work and take a breather. Exercising has many proven benefits, and we wanted to find a way to incorporate fun mini exercises throughout the day to help students (and people in general) think better and be healthier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitspiration is an app that sends notifications at specified time intervals by the user based on his or her schedule and encourages them to do mini activities, such as jumping jacks, chair-poses, leg-lifts, incline desk push-ups, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, running on Java, to create Fitspiration.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The formatting of everything was difficult and we had several small syntax errors. It was our first time using Android Studio and GitHub, so getting used to the programs was challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our app to load (#AllGritNoPearl). 
However, we are also proud that we were able to came up with our own idea, plan its various components, find ways to implement them, and work well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of planning that goes into an app and the process was much longer than we anticipated.We also learned a lot more about how to implement Java in Android Studio and perfect the basics, such as adding buttons, changing background colors, uploading pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fitspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand our app so that it can reward users with points that they can redeem at their health-conscious local businesses (i.e. yoga studio, juice bars, etc). We also would like to add more personalization for the user based on an inputted profile. For instance, if the user prefers cardio, the app would suggest jumping jacks, rather than push-ups. Also, if the weather is nice at the user's location, we'd like the app to suggest a walk outside.
