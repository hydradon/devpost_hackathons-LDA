                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Rudy went to China, he was very difficult for him to understand the menu of restaurants because he didn't speak Chinese. That's where the idea was coming from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is really simple. Imagine that you're going to a foreign country, let's say Russia. You don't speak Russian, and you decide to go in a restaurant. The menu is not translated and there is no image. How could you order ? And if you have allergies or intolerances, how to be sure to not order something that you can't eat ?
So, just flash a QR code on the menu and go to a app, with the menu of the restaurant directly in your language. And, if you have any allergies or intolerances, the app notifies the dish that you can't eat.
