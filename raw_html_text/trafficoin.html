                    Inspiration -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were fed up of getting stuck in traffic, and losing hours of productivity to its problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an Android background service built alongside a UI to help and encourage users reduce their drive-times, drive outside of rush hour, and choose alternative modes of transportation, primarily via an open coupon posting/ reviewing platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Java, GreenDAO, HERE Traffic API, and Google Positioning / Transition API. We split up into 2 backend and 2 front end developers to get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right traffic API to compliment our cost constraints and accurate data needs was a huge one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a really efficient and powerful service that we believe will empower end-users. We're proud of being able to perfect our idea through this hackathon and learn valuable skills regarding asynchronous programming, multilayer algorithmic programming, and optimizing local databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the biggest part of participating in a hackathon is growing as a developer and having fun, NOT competing. Talking to new people and sharing ideas is already a huge reward, especially when we're getting a chance to help our city in the process.
