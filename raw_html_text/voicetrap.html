                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to take on the inGenius challenge because none of us had worked on speech recognition before and  we wanted to learn something new. The prize was an incentive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to perform the basic functionality of reloading a page, clicking a button, deleting text from a textbox, typing things on a textbox through speech recognition, highlighting text, scrolling up and down and opening and closing a new window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to implement the functionality that a user would likely perform on a website, such as button clicks and entering/clearing text. We put all of this into a Chrome Extension and used annyang API to implement the speech recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension worked, but ever so rarely. It was hard for the microphone to pick up the voice commands to the trigger the functions, so majority of the time we had to repeat commands over and over again for the microphone to pick it up. We kind of sorted a bit of the problem by using the microphone through headphones.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to create a chrome extension that does what we want it to do, learning the syntax of java script, creating functions and commands that perform a particular task.

                    if we had more time, we would have created more functions, it took us a long time to figure out basic functions because we were learning javascript at the same time.We are planning to access shortcut key to implement the screenshot, search bar,copy, paste and so on. Also, we have found the module to capture the screenshot.
