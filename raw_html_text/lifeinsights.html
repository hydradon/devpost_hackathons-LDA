                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mark is heavily invested in the professional development community. He realized that using productivity apps just didn't cut it. They were too complex. Too unrealistic. What if we could make a more privatized app that just allows you to check on your own status. Many times, people say they want to improve areas of their life, but don't have the data to show where they're slacking. Sometimes, major areas in our lives are neglected because we're "too busy" with something else. Little by little, that thing we neglect can creep up on us and become a huge issue.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app, you will be able to create your own pillars of your life and keep track of them by your own ratings. You get to rate yourself. As stats add up, you can find statistical data on your performance in many areas, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, normal distribution curve/chart, etc. This gives the user a realistic sense of how they're performing/improving compared to their past.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually thought of this idea 10 minutes before submission time. It uses Python as the back-end and will use a Python GUI framework to make it more user friendly. Later, I will integrate this to mobile app platforms.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the Application using UML. 
Finding the best GUI library for Python. 
Figuring out ways to integrate it to IOS and Andriod.

                <p>
                    I started this 10 minutes before closing, and am motivated to continue to develop this app well past Spartahack V to make it into a tangible application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the second mobile application I will be creating!

                <p>
                    Even if I start late, it's about the future and the finish that count past this Hackathon. The hackathon helped me spawn the idea. I will now be inspired to continue to develop this to a tangible app for users who want a data based evaluation on their performance in life.
