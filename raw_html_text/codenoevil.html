                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be the catalyst that ends homelessness in St. Louis by creating a HMIS system that empowers CoC's administering care within our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Service St. Louis is a centralized coordinated entry program that provides resource management, digitized SPDAT, targeted services, and data analytics to improve the service delivery of care by CoC's. We accomplish this by facilitating easy entry of CoC services and SPDAT information. This, in turn, allows us to collect metrics and connect clients to eligible services though the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our simple resource directory allows both a CoC or a client to find specific services for their needs. This directory can either be accessed through our intuitive web interface or by calling our phone resource system that integrates with our centralized data store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has never been easier to connect a client to the care they need with Service St. Louis.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tech savvy engineers leveraged modern, scalable technology to create an intuitive, simple, and powerful HMIS tool.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many features we wanted to implement but we decided to focus on core workflows that directly aid CoC's and their clients.
                </p>
