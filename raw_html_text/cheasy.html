                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students going into college, or just individuals entering the real world in general often come ill-prepared. One of the most important life skills they lack is the ability to eat healthily, due to their inability to cook and their attitude towards it. Thus, many students find themselves resorting to unhealthy foods such as top ramen or frozen foods or just fast food. Thus, we've developed a website to show students how cheap and easy (cheasy) it is to prepare nutritious food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides users with a list of easily prepared, inexpensive dishes that can be replicated. Cheasy will provide the listed ingredients needed, the cost of each ingredient, and the nearest Target store that provides those ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a mixture of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, along with the help of the Edamam recipe API and the Target API to develop our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us were rather new to web development, but the learning curve was not as steep as we thought it'd be. We did run into some troubles with formatting/layouts every now and then as well as some errors in our JavaScript code, but they were relatively minor.
The major obstacle we overcame was working around Target's API which did not allow us to directly search Target's database with the food's name.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our very first website any of us created, so we're very proud of what we've put out this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Off the previous answer, this was the first website we tried to create. We learned how important it was to keep it aesthetically pleasing. We also used Github for one of the first times, so keeping local repositories updated with the online ones proved to be a struggle. We also learned how to implement API's and code in Javascript, a language most of us are inept in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cheasy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cheasy's next step is to incorporate more supermarket's APIs and show the supermarket at which the needed ingredients are the cheapest. After, it will have options to sort recipes from easiest to make to hardest, or from cheapest to most expensive depending on the wants or needs of the user. Then, we will implement a system that allows users to share ways in which they tweaked recipes. Maybe one user skimped on some ingredients and substituted with cheaper ones, or someone added an ingredient to a recipe and it made it that much better.
