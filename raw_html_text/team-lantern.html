                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Japanese Lantern Ceremonies, our project puts the user in a mysterious dark lake at night with brightly lit lanterns floating in the distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user discovers their own blank lantern and a paint brush. They are able to paint a message or symbol on their lantern and then launch the lantern into the lake and watch as it joins the other lanterns floating on the water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and various design/modeling software and modified assets from the Unity store, we each built separate components and combined them into a single unity project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Occlusion and light on the lanterns didn't cooperate. We had to integrate a painting mechanism onto a texture. The water reflections became problematic and we had to try to find a way for the user to understand what they are supposed to do without much instruction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are pleased with the atmosphere and ambiance we created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally learned new ways to utilize particle effects to create water effects and fog.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    That remains to be seen.
