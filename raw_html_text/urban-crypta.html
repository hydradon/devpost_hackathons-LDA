                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It always sucks to forget your password to a website or service and have to jump through hoops to retrieve it. This app will help you keep track of your passwords while also providing an easy way to recover them if you forget them.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Urban Crypta generates passwords of random length of random values. These passwords are then PGP encrypted with the user's key so only they can unencrypt it. Additionally, if they lose their key, they can save a 1 time generated phrase out of Urban dictionary and oxford dictionary words.
