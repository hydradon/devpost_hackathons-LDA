                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got dragged into playing commander with some of my friends, and I've been hooked ever since!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows you a list of commanders and allows you to look up commanders from Magic the Gathering using the Scryfall API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I planned out the features I wanted to use on a Trello board and then I opened up Android Studio and coded. I began work with the home screen and then created the list and search pages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brand new Coding environment, first time using API, Android being a difficult platform to program for
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to actually make this work!!! Also, having the search results show up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use APIs, what an API is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Command Zone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it prettier! Integrating every feature that I hadn't integrated, like a deck builder and a deck playtester! Also, a lore tab would be really interesting.
Specifically, looking towards the future
-Displaying Pictures on the Commander Search Tab
-Dynamic memory allocation so you can see the entire list of commanders
-Deck Builder that recommends cards
-Possibly a website
-Integrate with the TCGPlayer API to allow for purchasing of decks through the mass entry feature
-Deck Playtest (Draw sample hands, play out turns...)
