                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's spring, and cherry blossom bloom. I asked myself what if I could create and move cherry blossom leaves with my hands; moreover, what if I can create art? what if anyone can create art? That would help so much people out since there are so many great things about art! 
   I connected to my own experience of getting scared at fireworks. So to overcome the fear of fireworks, I thought this way of approach in therapy would have been great for me, and obviously someone else who were also scared at fireworks.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Through excessive amounts of research, understanding the power of arts, we applied the concepts with technologies such as wearable gesture control and motion control device - Myo armband, and Unity3D.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lack of time to fulfill all the traumatic cases that we really wanted to cover such designing special therapy theme for Natural Disasters care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We delivered the power of art through these technologies, and made people happy at the end!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That there are way too much people in need of therapy, but the there's too small amounts of therapy available, and they are too inefficient, and sometimes affordable. We need these kind of technologies.
                </p>
