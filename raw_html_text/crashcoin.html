                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by news of three different Autonomous crashes that have occurred within the past month. CrashCoin was born out of the necessity to record accident information

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CrashCoin uses a proprietary cryptographic token based decentralized ledger to record instantaneous collision information and encrypt that information into a token which can be openly read by any entity.
When the token is created,

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The coding for the project was built using Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Restful web services, MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. The hardware consists of a remote control car uses Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi, 14-megapixel camera, a breadboard, a wireless adaptor, USB multiplexer, and a Sphero.

                <p>
                    We have proved that we have an idea that could possibly change the officials determine car crashes and other implementations of using this crypto technology.

                    What is next is a better implementation in or to show of proof of concept.
