                    The theme was sustainability and we tried our best to calculate the carbon footprint of a person's car. We noticed that other websites did not take in account miles per gallon or gasoline type, so we created a calculator that accounted for those. We learned that creating a website is much more complicated that we initially thought. The animation of the oranges alone took around 2 hours of coding. It was a little hard to create this because we had no prior knowledge of building a website before. We found coding in html very different from C++.
