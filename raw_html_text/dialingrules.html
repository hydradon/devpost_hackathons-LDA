                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In call Center environment we get a lot of requests to change rules for dialing on regular basis for various programs and currently we handle all of this by manage engine tickets and assigning dev resources and then engaging database team to finally execute the changes. 
We always thought there was a better way to handle this business need and to hope over various layers to do this change without breaking stuff. 
With the help of LM we build a proof of concept solution which we can eventually handover to business owners and they'll get the ability to manage these important operational setting on there own.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today a user can select a campaign from the dropdown and change some important parameters from dialing filters and some basic prioritization. Once desired settings are selected, upon submission an email is generated with the RTQ fetch filter(SP) which can be sent to an email (for example helpdesk to open a ticket with DBAs) for now.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this application using LM and found it easy to learn over short period of time as we had very little exposure to this application prior to evening of 12/04 but with a little help from participants from Hackathon we were able to conclude this application to a presentable form.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to incomplete documentation we had to figure out a lot of functionality but it was fun for the most part. couldn't find a way to update external databases as our goal was to directly make changes to a dev database instead of sending emails. 
Also some issues with using certain controls which we had to take out of application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we have learnt basics of LM and how different components of LM are put togather to make application functional. We now feel comfortable that we  now know more about LM then before and it and accomplish more with less effort. 
We can work on this tool in our production environment with a little bit of help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We Learned this platform and think we can use this in various areas in callcenter enviroment for different application where we currently use ASP.NET applications. like Voxi, DNC apps License management system etc. basically anywhere were we get configuration changes from business that can be put in LM and a LM Dash board can be provided to end user.
                </p>

                    What's next for DialingRules
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 - We want to modify this application so that it saves settings in LM database so that we can pull last saved setting from LM for a campaign and user would know what is currently in production. 
2 - We are also planing to findout  a way to update dialing rules in in realtime. Plan is to develop a webservice and have that interact with LM and dialer database and push changes on realtime. 
3 - Expand this to control inbound call allocation for our inbound call allocators etc. 
4 - Expand this to control rules for lead distribution between various groups that we currently control internaly in call center.
