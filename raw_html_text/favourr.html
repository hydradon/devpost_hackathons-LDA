                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fiverr was a major inspiration along with the common use of instant messaging for asking for favours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows you to create a favour you wish for someone to do for you in exchange for your time used elsewhere in a one way platform.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# and ASP.NET Web Forms to build the entire system and a MySQL database for storing the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we wanted to use the Google OAuth API but couldn't get it working with our implementation and went with just using an inbuilt login system. We also had issues with the inbuilt SQL Server implementation and went with a standard MySQL server.
                </p>

                <p>

                    What's next for Favourr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to extend Favourr and add more of the nice to have features to it and ensure that it would work in an online environment with concurrent users.
