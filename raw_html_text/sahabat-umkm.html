                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many UMKM actors whose work combines the art and culture native to the area where they live. With the results of the work it should be able to lift their economy and cultural arts in their area. We see that UMKM are less developed in tourist attractions. Lack of knowledge to adaptation to the internet and technological developments experienced by UMKM. they are left behind, especially in their marketing products. So we want to develop an application to help UMKM in Banyuwangi better known by tourists who come.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    in this application we are proud to be able to integrate umkm with the arts and culture in it as well as places of tourism which later will make it easier for SMEs in doing business and make it easier for prospective buyers who want to find local umkm products that must be purchased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learn about economic equality and advance local culture. Because of what? because many SMEs have already made their work and sold it, but there are still a few works sold, not even a few who underestimate their work. So from that we learned about business efforts and put forward more products from existing local umkm.
