                    At time of writing this, Real State is not yet well served in the Alexa store, which encourage to build some skills in such area. Looking for available APIs, found one for rent prices in Europe, which I assume as a good start
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply, open the skill on Alexa by saying "Alexa Open Rent Europe", then you will be asked to enter a city, now you say the name of the desired city within Europe), and it feeds back the average rent price
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've built it using node.js as a Lambda function platform provided AWS, and Alexa Skills Kit
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finding a suitable API was a slight challenge, but calling an API from lambda function consumed a lot of time and effort as needed a lot of testing, and a careful use of "callback" functions, and a good understanding of context object methods
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to thank rentswatch.com for providing their API service (which is free!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planning to provide other possible cities of the world, and more detailed pricing according to the building, like if it is a villa or apartment, number of bedrooms ...,etc.
