                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I realised I've carried a smartphone since 2011 so my location history was pretty reliably captured since then. You can download this from Google but it's just a block of coordinates in KML, so I wanted a visualisation. I thought a single unbroken line would be an elegant way to see where I'd been, like a wake or trail of footprints.

                            flag will tidy up the huge KML file that Google gives you and reduce it to locations separated by at least 100km. For me, that stripped it down to just over 200 locations.

                    Implementing the labels in a couple of hours flat - HERE.com's API was much simpler to implement than I expected.

                    I learned how to handle JSON data, as that was the format the HERE.com API supplied its results in.
