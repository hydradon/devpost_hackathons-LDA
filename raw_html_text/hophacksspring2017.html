                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, a student gets emails, event invites, and is bombarded with information from every side. We seek to centralize that information, and focus it to just what a person wants and needs to know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a student to browse announcements, read articles, and view event data for goings-on at Johns Hopkins. They can manage or participate in clubs, subscribe to different news sources, or keep up-to-date with important announcements from the university.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by building minimal working models on the interactions of the parts - basic communications between the app, server, and database. From there, we build each service up individually: configuring the database to store data, building the server to interpret it, and designing our mobile app to allow the user to interact with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to build enough of a content base to give users a compelling alternative to already-established data ssources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to parse and output key information from all articles on a well-known news site. Well-designed mobile app and website UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A hefty amount of MySQL and Swift, some web scraping, and a good sense of how to integrate them all together.
                </p>

                    What's next for HopHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increased integration with Facebook and other common news/social sites, to build up a larger content base.
