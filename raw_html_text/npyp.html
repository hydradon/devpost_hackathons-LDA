                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning would be one of it. With my Majors being a completely different stream. I had to take in the aspects of a Computer Science student working on a project. Which gave me a whole new perspective on What I could do.

                <p>
                    Make it available for public use and try to make it a native application for some mobile. What else would be better when we get to use the apps we were not aware of it's existence.
