                    Sometimes we can get stuck pondering choices in life: whether you have time to make lasagna for dinner tonight, if you should get out of bed to go to the gym or just sleep more, should you really drink any more coffee today? All of these and more can be answered by the power of your watch, assuming you had the foresight to grab yourself a Pebble watch that is. Shake your wrist to reveal the answer to some of life's most difficult but necessary questions and find certainty with The Wrist of Fortune!
