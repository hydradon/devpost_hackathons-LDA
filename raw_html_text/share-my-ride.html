                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since Each person will be busy in his own work,It is difficult to schedule Uber during crunch times.So it would be helpful to book a uber ahead of time.
Also Even though two friends will be travelling between two common points using Uber,.Since One wont be knowing the schedule/Calendar of the other.They would have to pay up the whole travel cost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
