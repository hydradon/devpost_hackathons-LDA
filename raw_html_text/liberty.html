                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sci-fi movies and cyberpunk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application performs continuous visual search of every item or person spotted. The next part is providing a convenient way to interact with it or with the person: you can get recommendations or places to purchase an item, or get in touch with someone you just met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of the app is neural network designed to describe what phone's camera sees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we needed to leverage the responsiveness and accuracy of visual search performed. It is done with balancing the delays in the flow of scanning and performing visual search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, our interface was needed to be flexible because of different media parts we suppose to fit into. It was considered while the backend responses structure was built.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution is flexible, extensible and scalable. It has a great base to create partnership with many businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's never too late to pick a whole new idea even during the hackaton.
