                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our background is in neuroscience research. As part of our work, we generate three-dimensional reconstructions of patients' brain geometry, computed from spatial images. One essential&mdash;but
                    <em>
                        extremely
                    </em>
                    tedious&mdash;step in this pipeline involves manually removing the patient's cerebellum from the volumetric data one slice at a time, a process that takes upwards of 6 hours to complete.

                    &mdash;a VR "volumetric painting" app&mdash;on a collaborator's HTC Vive, we realized that, if we could intuitively "erase" MRI geometry in VR, we could cut that time drastically enough to justify buying a Vive for our own (
                    <em>
                        totally science-related

                    But, more than that, we realized we were excited just to see what spatial images
                    <em>
                        actually look like
                    </em>
                    . To break away from coronal, sagittal, and axial. To step inside a brain the size of a Volkswagen.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Python libraries (NumPy, PIL, NiBabel) to convert imaging data stored in standard formats (DICOM, NIfTI) to texture data suitable for UnrealEngine 4. This texture data is then fed into a material shader for a system of semi-transparent particles scattered throughout the workspace; this custom material "paints" the particles with the appropriate color and opacity by interpolating the underlying spatial image, creating a volumetric hologram effect.

                        Getting UnrealEngine code to link properly with external libraries can be nontrivial.

                        Constructing UE4 Blueprint scripts requires skills orthogonal to programming.
