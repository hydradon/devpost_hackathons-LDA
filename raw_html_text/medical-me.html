                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people can recall visiting the doctor and receiving a fairly accurate diagnosis and effective medicine. However, health care can be more often than not, inefficient. As Time's Money once reported, it costs about $43 to sit around the doctor's waiting room. The effect of such lack of productive visits are even more noticeable from the perspective of time; while the American Journal of Managed Care estimates, on average, 121 minutes spent when a person seeks medical care, a great amount when compared to the paltry 20 minutes one actually spends.

                <p>
                    How can people save time and money, while not neglecting their health? And how can people receive diagnoses for symptoms that may be serious?

                <p>
                    Medical.me makes accessing you medical information, and getting a diagnoses, as easy as talking out loud.

                    Medical.me integrates your medical history with a powerful AI that helps answer questions about your prescriptions, injuries, pains, and your medical record.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our software uses two powerful APIs to process data and to help connect us with patients in ways that were never possible before. Cerner provides access to vast medical information, including thousands of prescription medicines, doctor history, and patient information. Amazon Echo helps us bring our app to the common household, making it both convenient and accessible.
