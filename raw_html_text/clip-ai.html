                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration to create clip.ai stemmed from a common problem that we would encounter at school. Creating works cited pages for our papers had always been a tedious and inefficient process, and we wanted to create a tool that could minimize the amount of work we had to do. In general, it's tedious to copy only one item at a time, which often limits people's ability to copy and paste effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    clip.ai is a clipboard that allows for cross connection across devices (Windows and Android). Additionally, our project allows users to copy multiple items to their clipboard and stores them in an online database (Firebase). Users can then retrieve copied items from other devices (laptops, phones etc), and can look at past copied items. clip.ai also has a predictor which uses an algorithm to identify which words are optimal for use (similar to an autocomplete function). clip.ai performs all of these actions while ensuring secure transfer of information via the use of Secure Socket Layers and Data Encryption on our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built clip.ai's desktop app using electron and Node.js to connect with our firebase database. Our projects mobile application was built using Android Studio (Java). Our informative website was created using plain HTML and CSS along with some use of bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of problems while importing dependencies on Android Studio and were also challenged as we learned how to use firebase. Additionally, we ran into problems while trying to format our website (transitioning from CSS to Bootstrap).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a fully functional MVP. Additionally, we learned how to set up an effective and responsive database on Firebase. We are proud that we were able to create fully functional desktop and mobile applications, as well as a working informative website. Finally, we are proud that we were able to make our project secure through the use of Secure Socket Layers (SSL) on Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with new software such as Firebase and electron, and built upon our current knowledge in computer science such as web development, databases, cybersecurity, and building multiplatform applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for clip.ai
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand this project to support more operating systems such as IOS and Linux. Additionally, we hope to finetune our algorithms so they will be able to predict (more accurately) what users need.
