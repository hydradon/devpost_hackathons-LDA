                        Our team believed safety is the key factor while driving, since texting and drive has become a growing issue and nearly 25% of ALL car accident are cause by texting and driving, we wanted to reduce this probability. Almost everyone has a slight temptation to use your phone while driving even though we know it's the wrong thing to do, we wanted to give that access without ever touching your phone.
