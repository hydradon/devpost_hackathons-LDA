                    Many people share the view that there are no "good" ads. Those people prefer to not see any ads at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is that the blank space taken up by the blocked ads remains unused. Our project seeks to make use of the unused space by replacing it with useful content. We will build a browser extention that will replace adds with most breaking Fintech industry news.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We called our extention FinBlock.
