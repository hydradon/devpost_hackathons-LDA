                    We were inspired by transformers and we tried to build a transforming robot. We built it by using the UBTECH building blocks and coded it it through our iPads. A challenge we faced was making the robot actually walk. It was not possible due to the servos used being too weak unable to support the robot&rsquo;s weight once a leg is raised. We tried to make it slide through without lifting the leg, but that also caused problems because the robot was unable to move properly due to the lack of friction. We tried to combat that problem with rubber bands, but it made things worse. We eventually scrapped that idea and made it just transform into a car from a neutral form. We are proud of the transformation and the thinking required to make the robot balance and stand up. We learned that it is hard to make a robot walk. We are going to make it walk I think...
