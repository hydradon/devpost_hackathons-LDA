                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, in third world countries, on-site revisions are made to the natural gas systems of people's houses every few years to ensure that everything is safe. But what happens between revisions, what happens if something breaks but you still have 3 years until your next revision, what happens if you are traveling and you let your stove valve open?. By leveraging IoT technologies and Azure products, this tool attempts to provide an affordable, escalable and practical way to solve this problem. It doesn't aim to be a full packing measuring solution with and accuracy of 100%, but it wont cost a fraction of that either. It leverages existing installations to provide some quick, simple, additional insights which can repercute on huge savings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using an IoT edge device, and continuosly reading the data from the accumulated total consumption of the house (reading directly from the same instrument that is used for billing purposes), you could establish consumption patterns and identify anomalies. So for example: On weekdays, gas is used only to cook. If the consumption becomes constant throughout the day, that means there are a valve open or a leak in the system. Any of those would trigger a notification to the people living in the house. If this pattern repeats itself, and on-site revision is scheduled.
