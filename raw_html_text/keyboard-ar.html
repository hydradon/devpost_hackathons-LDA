                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays everything is done on the Internet: online banking, online shopping, online application, etc, which forces the middle-aged population to get online. While some adapt to new technologies quickly, a majority of them does not. Observing my parents and other people around me who have struggles learning how to type, I want to build something that can help them with the learning curve and help them type faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application let user wear the smart glasses and try to recognize the position of the keyboard. The recognition result works best when the glasses are 20-25cm above the keyboard, which is the recommended reading distance between the eyes and the keyboards. The application then try to detect each row of characters of the keyboard.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built on the smart glass Vuzix using Vuforia Engine and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool does not pick up the keyboard image as easy as other images because of the glare reflected from the laptop surface, hence I had to use a workaround.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of stepping outside of my comfort zone and learning Augmented Reality.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Keyboard AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step of the application will give users a way to input words or sentences, either through voice or character recognition of another text, then highlight the keys on the keyboard as user types. Ideally, there will be a dataset of keyboards to enhance the analyzation of different layouts and types of keyboards.
