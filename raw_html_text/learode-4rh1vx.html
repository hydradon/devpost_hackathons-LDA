                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I get home and think to myself that I want to learn something new, but as soon as I start Googling around tutorials, I get lost in front of the quantity of results. So Learode popped up in my mind!
After you finish your coding day and get back home, you fire up the web app, and surprise, it gives you a reading list ! No more googling and looking around. The ideal version would be one that will give you precisely what you want, or even better, tutorials about technologies and languages that you don't know that you want yet, but will make you addicted once you start using it !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learode is a web app that allows developers to create a list of tutorials, guides and about the programming languages they work with in Github. The current prototype scans your github repositories and returns a reading list based on the languages used. For now there's only a small list of resources available, although there's the option to submit your own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The submitted version of Learode took around three weeks of work:
First week was creating a software design document, the two other weeks were developing the actual project with lots of testing in between.
Tutorials were a great help as well, and knowing how to search for your problem online is the most amazing skill I can advise people to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Escaping from my bubble of low-level programming and algorithmics! Also, while I know how to do front-end development, I was never that good in it, so getting something up and ready so quickly while learning most of the things I was working with was a huge challenge, but the most fun experience I had in development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing, developing, testing and deploying Learode. I pushed my limits extensively and learned so many new things. Learode is the project that made me think that while Computer Science is very fun, fathering a project from scratch is an amazing thing as well !
Another pseudo accomplishment is getting to know React ! It's so readable and understandable, yet so powerful, I can totally get why people love it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React, API development, Front-End development, testing, debugging, deploying... What didn't I learn !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of features that can be added to the application:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bug fixes: Some bugs are still laying around and
                        <em>
                            someone
                        </em>
                        has to fix them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Security improvements: The web app currently exhibits vulnerabilities that should be addressed before anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test GraphQL! Already in progress, migrating to GraphQL is something that will probably help with performance and code readability
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Advertisement: Learode has a huge potential for ad revenues. Providing users with suggestions for interesting on-sale books and guides may offer a steady revenue source.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Machine learning: Predicting users learning curve, languages to be used, growing technology interest and level with the language in question can be very interesting to offer better services and recommendation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More efficient tutorial recommendation:
                    </li>
