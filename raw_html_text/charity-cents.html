                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if giving money to charity was painless? What if you could contribute a painless amount on a regular basis automatically? What if lives were changed as a result?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app lets users effortlessly donate your painless amounts of money after each transaction (up to a maximum of 50 cents/transaction) to a pre-selected charity of their choosing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is an idea and a simulator. It could be a sweet idea for a financial institution to roll out. The institution could earn respect for promoting social change and the company would likely see an increase of transactions because users would be more motivated to spend (as their spending has positive social impact).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Ruby 2.2.1.
                </p>

                    What's next for Charity Cents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up next, we plan to develop a front end for this app, add more integration with APIs from financial institutions, and add more charities and incentives to give.
