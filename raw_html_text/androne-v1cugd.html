                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UAV based surveillance systems are
                    <strong>
                        expensive
                    </strong>
                    . Additionally, current systems take pictures, and then send them to a ground station for image processing. Since images have to be captured, and then relayed to a ground station for analysis, extra time is added, which reduces the overall efficiency.

                    !(Androne) improves on current systems by being an app that runs on your android phone and can do the same features as commercial grade systems. Androne is currently able to take pictures, correct picture distortion given geo location, and send original and corrected images to a ground station.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Androne is built using Android Studio, OpenCV, Java, and the Mavlink library.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge with working on Androne is learning all the tools we used in making it.

                <p>
                    We are proud that Androne is able to take pictures, adjust them, and send them to a ground station.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are learning how to develop Android apps for critical applications, work with OpenCV, and communication protocols via TCP ports.

                <p>
                    Androne is part of the Robotics Association at Embry-Riddle(RAER), which will ultimately compete this summer in the UAVSI
