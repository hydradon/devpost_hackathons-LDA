                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tango and the Leap Motion gave us a unique opportunity to create a game that was different from any we had seen before in terms of control elements and thus allows us to provide the user with a truly immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that allows a dungeon master to spawn enemies using the Leap Motion to impede the path of the explorers using the Tango to fight their way through to the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Unity and used Photon Network controls to allow the game to be played on computer and the Project Tango tablet at the same time.  I did the art for Cubey using my drawing tablet and Paint.net.  Other features were built using a combo of built in Unity tools, LeapMotion API, and Tango API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a lot of hardware working together is difficult.
Creating a multiplayer game and handling real-time synchronization is also difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating both the leap motion and the Tango together to create a unique multiplayer experience featuring one player as a dungeon master and additional players as mere explorers of the dungeon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking in Unity using Photon
The Tango Unity API
The Leap Motion Unity API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cubey's Dungeon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More enemy types, better AI, as well as more dungeons to explore and greater power by the dungeon master to design his dungeon will make the game even more amazing.
                </p>
