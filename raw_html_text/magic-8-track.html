                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working on my main project, it was 9 AM and I needed a break
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays music in response to your magic 8ball questions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio, very simple to construct
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accelorometer has been depreciated so I gave up on phone shaking support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Learning about the animation library that made the ball accelerate well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I could have fun after a whole day of grueling work
                </p>
