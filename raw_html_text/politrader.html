                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was always intrigued by political events but struggled to create conversations among our friends. People who actively seeked out the political news at our age were few and far between.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    poliTrader is an online trading simulator where users can invest in politcian&rsquo;s popularity. Traders can grow their balances by reading up on current political news and seeing which politicians are making favorable decisions, thus strengthening their investment choices. On the flip side, buying into unpopular figures can destroy profits. Users can cash in their profits for gift cards.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use python's Twitter API to collect a plethora of tweets and then used the Textblog API do perform sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision was challenged because we didn't know if there was a market for this. However, after preliminary research we soon recognized that a lot of people were interested in learning more about the world around them, they just didn't know where to start.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a plethora of new technologies in such a short time! So exhilirating
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that teamwork and dedication can overcome any hurdle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for poliTrader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the upcoming months, we plan on building our own machine learning models for analyzing tweets. We will also consider sponshorship partnership with promising organizations. Stay tuned!
