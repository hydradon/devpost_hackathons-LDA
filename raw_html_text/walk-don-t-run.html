                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking around at night is intimidating and a lot of girls feel insecure walking at night in paths they don't know.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of WalkDontRun is to come up with the safest and shortest path from a place to another to mainly help girls and women feel safe at night.  It also produces a heat map of a the current region's crime rates to best visualize the surrounding paths' danger/red zones and green/safe zones.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project consisted of two main parts: the front end which is the mobile website and the back end which is the server. The mobile website was built using HTML/CSS/Jquery. We have also used some bootswatch templates to ensure that the website is mobile. The second part of the project, the server, was built using JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us in the team had any experience with using JavaScript in which we planned to build the server with it. While it was very challenging to learn a whole new language in less than 24 hours, we were able to get the sever working with the help of our mentors.
