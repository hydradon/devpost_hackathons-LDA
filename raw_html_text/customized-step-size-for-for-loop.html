                    Inspiration : The main source of inspiration was the same functionality is present in general purpose languages unlike UiPath.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : It basically skips the intermediate values present in the array depending on the step size.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it : I coded a snippet where the array and the step size should be passed as an argument.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into : In the time of execution faced a few bugs which was resolved eventually.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of : Nothing as of yet.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learnt : In terms of development in UiPath learnt a lot to quantify in words.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Customized Step Size for FOR Loop : Can't think of any as of now.
