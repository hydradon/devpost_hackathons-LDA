                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am completely new to Unity and pretty much computer programming in general. However, after seeing a basic tutorial on the Unity web site, I figured I could make something even more out of it. I applied the basics of the tutorial to this new game to include 2 players, separate text boxes, and more environment/obstacles to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2 player game where the objective is to roll around and collect more crystals than your opponent does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to quickly learn about the many concepts of Unity and C# coding. I also integrated my previous experience with CAD software to make the terrain and environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were various bugs that I encountered in the c# coding that I did. Also, I had some trouble understanding some of the concepts that I learned in the tutorials and had some trouble applying them to other parts of the project. However, after a bit of practice, I understood most of what I was doing and succeeded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like I said before, I had to apply the aspects of the tutorial that were on Player 1 (i.e. score counter, sound effects) to Player 2 as independent values. Doing this was challenging though I was able to quickly catch on and figure everything out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of Unity and C# programming. More specifically, I learned how to intertwine things in my project to a player using scripts. For example, I learned about collision detecting or adding sound effects to the game. Also, I learned how to create my own custom inputs or controls which I used to control two different objects. I also learned that computers are very picky because a single bracket can mean the difference between a failed program and a successful one. Other than that, I learned that working as a team can sometimes be beneficial when there is a lot to do, but other times, it's better to be alone and independent. I enjoyed working by myself (though still around my friends) because I got to tweak everything to just the way I wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rolaball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on adding multiple levels of difficulty as well as a better camera movement system. Also, I foresee the use of something like Leap Motion to track hand movements to control the movement of the balls in the game. I also would like to include different point values for other types of crystals. There certainly is a lot of room for improvement and expansions which I plan on working on in the future.
