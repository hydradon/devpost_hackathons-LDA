                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggle to find transferable GE's at affordable prices, so we wanted to create something that would help complete this task easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares classes and prices and how they will transfer to your school.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an Android app that looks nice and is easy to use. We attempted to web scrape for the data, but that didn't work out too well for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    EVERYTHING

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to change colors in Android Studio. We're proud of each other for trying and actually coming back in the morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We suck at coding. Android Studio is hard to use. What is web scraping?????
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Assist But Better
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it actually work on the backend. We hope to continue working on it over the summer.
