                <p>
                    A network where people can post events that have free food! a great way to connect, feed the hungry and advertise!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a Web app using Meteor.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble over writing Meteor's pre-set functions such as front-end styling and database functions that were set on creating a user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are very proud of the free food! Just kidding (kind of)  we are very proud of our front-end (Thanks to Phil for mocking up in photoshop) as well as our database functionality!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to really play to our strengths, it really felt like a mini team we had from front-end, back-end, middle-woman! Anyone can code! Let no person think they can't!
                </p>
