                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being international students pursuing a career in tech, we realized that there are lots of individuals in our country that do not have access to academic resources, hence we decided to develop a mobile and progressive web app to enable users to access the same resources offline without the limitations of unlimited data/wifi or laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product will give students from underrepresented countries access to learning materials that can help them to be a success in the field of Computer Science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by utilizing tools such as Xcode, Swift, Javascript, Html, Css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the materials we did not understand, therefore, we utilize videos from youtube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first Hackathon! therefore we are proud of each other that we went through with it until the end. We also made an amazing product to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are not has bad as we thought.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add future implementations that we couldn't add in the time frame granted to us.
