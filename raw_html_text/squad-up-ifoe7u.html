                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picture this, I was all ready to go to Yale and just hack away. I wanted to hack without any worry. I wanted to come home after hacking and feel that I had accomplished a functional app that I could see people using. I was not sure if I wanted to team up with anyone, but I signed up to be placed on a UMD team. Unfortunately none of the team members wanted to group up, so I developed this application alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I volunteered at Technica last week and saw that chaos that is team formation and I saw the team formation at YHack. I think there is a lot of room for team formation to be more fleshed out, so that is what I set out on trying to fix. I wanted to build an app that could make team building at hackathons efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easily set up "Event rooms" for hackathons, allowing users to join the room, specify their interests, and message other participants that are LFT (looking for team). Once they have formed a team, they can easily get out of the chatroom simply by holding their name down and POOF, no longer LFT!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a Firebase server that stores a database of events. Events hold information obviously regarding the event as well as a collection of all members that are LFT. After getting acquainted with Firebase, I just took the application piece by piece. First order of business was adding an event, and then displaying all events, and then getting an individual event, adding a user, deleting a user, viewing all users and then beautifying with lots of animations and proper Material design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Animation still seems to be much more complex than it needs to be, so that was a challenge and a half. I want my applications to flow, but the meticulousness of Android and its fragmentation problems can cause a brain ache.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general, I am very proud with the state of the app. I think it serves a very nifty core purpose that can be utilized in the future. Additionally, I am proud of the application's simplicity. I think I set out on a really solid and feasible goal for this weekend that I was able to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed the fact that I was able to think about my project, plan ahead, implement piece by piece, go back and rewrite, etc until I had a fully functional app. This project helped me realize that I am a strong developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do not be afraid to erase code that I already wrote. If it's broken and I have lots of spaghetti code, it's much better to try and take a step back, rethink the problem, and then attempt to fix the issues and move forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Squad Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue to update the project as well as provide more functionalities. I'm currently trying to get a published .apk on my Namecheap domain (squadupwith.me), but I'm not sure how long this DNS propagation will take. Also, I currently have the .apk to only work for Android 7.1.1, so I will have to go back and add backwards compatibility for the android users who are not on the glorious nexus experience.
