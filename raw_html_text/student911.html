                <p>
                    Students require time to study for finals. To help them prepare, we designed this website so to offer them resources both in the educational department, but also for their mental health and wellbeing, which is an underappreciated aspect for academic success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website provides resources for many academic subjects, while also allowing students to rate resources and  provide their own for their utilisation and others'. It also includes links to therapy services and lists of advice and tips to do to manage stress and their mental wellbeing.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to design the webpages and python Django web framework for backend

                    It was hard hard at first for all three of us to come up with an idea that we all agree upon.
