                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackMan is entirely inspired by HackRiddle 2019 itself. From the characters to the aesthetics, we tried to incorporate as much as we could into HackMan. Overcome obstacles, shoot code at the bugs that crash you, don't let your energy get drained, and make it all 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackMan is a simple sidescroller game that is surprisingly difficult and pleasing to the eye.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and JavaFX. Sprites and other visual aspects of the game were hand-drawn in Procreate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real challenge happened before the coding began: forming and agreeing on an idea in the first place. Rejecting beloved ideas like
                    <em>
                        Is It an Avocado?
                    </em>
                    (an app that tells you if it is an avocado). We also ran into some other challenges, such as animating the sprite, object interaction, and making quality graphics, but those weren't so bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make sprite sheets, how to implement a hit box, and most importantly, how to love each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackMan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not sure. We just want to sleep.
