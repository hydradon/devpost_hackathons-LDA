                    Study Buddy was created with the intention of allowing students an easier way to meet up to work. Sometimes students want to go to a library to work on projects or study. They might end up sitting alone while unbeknownst to them their friend is sitting alone just around the corner. This app will allow students to find each other at different locations on campus, enabling them to study more effectively.

                    This was a fantastic learning experience! We got to work with Google Cloud, React, and Domain.com for the first time. We overcame many challenges to successfully attach a React web-app to Google Cloud. Although many aspects still need to be developed, we are confident that Study Buddy will be a very innovative app. We plan to use Radar and Blockstack ID to further develop our web-app.
