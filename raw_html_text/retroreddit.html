                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several of the libraries that we had worked with weren't well documented, and weren't the friendliest to work with, but were the only options we had, save writing in Bash, which none of us were all that experienced with. In one instance we had spent several hours scratching our heads on why a library wasn't functioning properly, although everything was properly installed. The author of CurseBox had not registered his work on PyPI, and instead we had pip installed another library under the same name.

                    Adding more macro bindings for an easier browsing experience. And adding more options for user customization.
