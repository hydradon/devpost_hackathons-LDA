                    Xplore: a child-friendly multiplication game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A family member uses multiplication games for their work as speech therapist. The app they use is terrible and some levels are not designed to succeed at. We wanted to offer an alternative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A multiplication game in 3 levels, where at each level the player has to answer correctly a number of questions to move on to the second level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is a JAVA app, developed entirely in AWT/SWING
The back-end part was built such that there's a database that connects with the interface. This part was aiming to be useful for a machine learning approach that we didn't have time to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building interface from scratch, designing the architecture of the app several times, lack of time to do everything we wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a game that works and we have beautiful graphics for children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a business spirit in the team in addition to the developers brought another point of view to the game ! And we got some dust off our coding skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Xplore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop the adaptive learning algorithm, work on difficulties of levels according to the player. And since children learn better when writing, we could make the input hand written and use digit recognition for it. Work on the interface and animations as well. Make better use of the database implementation.
