                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were compelled to create FeelSociety out of a disdain for traditional social networks which motivate users to hide their real emotions in order to gain social acceptance. Most people cannot share things in their life that could result in social stigma. This results in many large social media platforms which are filled with inauthenticity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can record their thoughts in a personal journal and have the option to join an anonymous one-on-one chat room. Inappropriate behaviour in the chat rooms is reduced through optional spectators and a commend and report system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application using various technologies including Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, and Express. Node.js is used to create the server; Socket.io is used to manage real-time functionalities required for the chat room; Mongoose manages our database; and, Express is used to form the REST structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We consistently ran into troubles with Materialize, the CSS framework that were using, for no good reason. We also had a good struggle making the text-chat rooms private. And, of course, time was a concern.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much functionality we were able to include in our web application.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Socket.io engine and our general web development skills were improved.
