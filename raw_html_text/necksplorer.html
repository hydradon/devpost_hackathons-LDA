                    7 out of 10 people will experience neck aches at some point in their lives, according to a special health report prepared by Harvard Medical School in 2016. It is called the &ldquo;text neck syndrome&rdquo; and, according to an international study conducted by researchers from Khon Kaen University from Thailand, a large majority of the 3.3 billion smartphone users in the world are putting their necks at risk every time they use their mobile phones.

                    &ldquo;Text neck syndrome&rdquo; compresses and tightens the muscle, tendon, and ligament structures in front of the neck while lengthening the muscles, tendon and ligament structures behind the neck. &ldquo;The human head weighs 10 pounds. For every inch your head is tilted forward, the weight your neck has to carry doubles&rdquo;, explains Dr. Ciara Cappo, chiropractor at Cappo Chiropractic &amp; Sports Therapy, according to healthline.com.

                    Considering this, and all the postural problems caused by smartphone usage and experienced by all of us, we decided to look for a solution inside the problem: what if we could improve text neck problems generated by smartphones with a&hellip; smartphone game?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose one of the most used social networks in the world, Instagram, and one of its trending features: the filters. Using AR we designed a multi-level game in which every neck movements done right help users pass a level and also improve their posture and decrease the risk of suffering of musculoskeletal disorders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Types of neck movements the AR game uses: chin tucks, side bending, nose spiral.
