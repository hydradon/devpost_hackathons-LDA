                    hey.. so it all started with the annoying alarm.. ringing around 5.A.M as I picked up the phone and guess what, I saw a message from one of my senior msg regarding the hackathon which he was to conduct today. I read the whole msg but as soon as I stepped the last line I read something Goodies... Then what, I jumped off the bed with excitement. The excitement went wilder and I got to know that Microsoft and GitHub are the sponsors of the event. I gave a call to him and asked the details.. and reached the venue as mentioned. After 4 hours of non-stop work, I completed the website. I know it's not that rich in content but still, I have put my jealous effort to make it as attractive as i could.
