                <p>
                    We arrived at the hackathon ready to work(without an idea), pulled out our laptops and we realized that we forgot a mouse!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a program that lets your phone act as a mouse that connects to your PC.
