                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of a collaborative platform that meets the demands of workplace productivity, artistic creativity, and educational connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a multi purpose canvas that allows students, artists, and professionals to pursue their endeavors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the backend using express, mongodb, socket.io; while the front end was done exclusively in react native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing multiple user functionality into the app was quite difficult. Also getting the paper to render near simultaneously was a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working product. Able to communicate through socket to simultaneously display a shared screen between devices. Encrypted passwords for user accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the communication paradigm between front end technologies and back end technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shared Paper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to sync points vs strokes eventually, this will allow the app to become much more smooth for the user.
