                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we live a big house with mutiple bathrooms so it would be nice to know who is in it remotely
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sends a signal to the cloud through rasberry pi, so you can see it in an app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using rasberry pi, and pir sensor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    connecting to google cloud sql was a problem at first, and the pir sensor is not the best choice sensor for our task
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned how to use rasberry pi and google cloud sql
