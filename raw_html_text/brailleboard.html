                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by looking at the difficulties that the blind community faces. It is very hard to get by functionally as a blind person, and we are trying to change that. As the world moves forward into the digital age, we wanted to make sure that the blind community doesn't get left behind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The key caps for the keyboard are 3D printed with Braille. Certain parts of the keyboard have raised dots to represent the letters in the Braille language. As the user feels the Braille, they will be able to use the keyboard more comfortably and efficiently. It also exposes the Braille language to other users so that more people can learn to be accommodating to the blind community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the 3D design software 3D Builder to design the key caps with the Braille. We then sent the files to the 3D printer so that they could be printed.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges included the sizing of the key caps relative to the keyboard and the different types of switches different keyboard have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we were restricted by printing time we were able to print out many keys for the keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use 3D design software and we learned more about 3D printing. We also would like to thank VOXEL bot for letting us use the 3D printer, without which this project would not be possible.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Brailleboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brailleboard is looking to be the next best key caps for the blind community and even the whole world. We want more people to be exposed to the struggles that blind people go through.
