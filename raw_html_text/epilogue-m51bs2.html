                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On arrival, our team came with zero idea of what a hackathon is or what we had to do at a hackathon. Two hours into the start of the hackathon we had no clue what we were going to create. During our brainstorm session, we hit a brick wall. So, we split ways and eventually one of us ended up in front "Go Fish " mural of a guy smoking. That was where the inspiration for &ldquo;Epilogue&rdquo; came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s a modular device that is attached to the magnetic base below you&rsquo;re personal JUUL device.  Which is intended to make JUUL addicts quit by limiting the amount of times the use the device per day. In return the &ldquo;Epilogue app&rdquo; provides the user with: -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daily Status:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Number of puffs for today:
Last used:
Pod juice left:
Pods used this week:
Number of times exceed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Progress:
Graph with weekly progress (that positive growth or decline)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rewards:
A positive reinforcer that promotes user to use less of the juul
That is in turn rewarded with Discounts to stores, prices etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alerts :
The app reminds the user of how many puffs they have taken on the specific day and how many they have left .
This promotes the user to pace himself/herself with using the JUUL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Arduino board to emulate the signal received from the pressure sensor inside a JUUL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Components used:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jumper wires
Arduino board
Breadboard
LED
Touch sensor
We then coded using the Arduino ide and transferred the code into Android studio, where we did majority of the coding for the app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we had 0 prior experience with an Arduino kit, we researched how to use it online and emulated the sensor board. We ran into multiple errors while coding and transferring data from Arduino to android studio.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first-time hackers our team came up with an idea, worked on backend programing, the front-end GUI, hardware and marketing plans all in a span of 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we learned how to use an Arduino kit. We learned how to connect hardware to software, and we learned how to communicate as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Epilogue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a bigger vision for this project in the future. As a group of college students, our social environment is surrounded by friends who have become addicted and enslaved to this product. We have witnessed how it has negatively impacted our society and we aim to put an end to it with &ldquo;Epilogue&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of 2019, we have found documents and patents of a new JUUL that is about to hit the markets soon, which comes with an inbuilt microcontroller and memory storage unit. It also comes with a compatible app which has features such as Bluetooth, location, notifications and a voltage limiter. With upcoming inbuilt technology, we intended to improve ours as well by using fingerprint sensors to detect the user and personalize the epilogue and JUUL depending on the user.
