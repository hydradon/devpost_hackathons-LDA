                    I love going on roadtrips with friends, and being college students, money isn't always there. Splitting the cost of a road trip is easy until you have to account for tolls. You'd need to go to a separate website for every state you're travelling through, figure out which exit you get on the highway in that state and which exit you get out, and then sum it all together. This is where TollGO comes in.

                    TollGO was made to help people figure out how much they have to pay in tolls
                    <strong>
                        before
                    </strong>
                    they go on their trip.
