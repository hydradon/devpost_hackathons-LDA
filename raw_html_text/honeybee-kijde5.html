                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Finn, enjoys cyber security and had the idea for this program. Many companies could benefit from this additional layer of security to help keep hackers out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HoneyBee acts as an external layer of security against hackers. It poses as an unprotected server outside of the firewall to attract hackers looking to find vulnerabilities. When the hacker attempts to connect, however, it communicates with the firewall to blacklist that IP address. Thus, any hacker who stumbles into the trap will be unable to access any of the data on the network. HoneyBee is a blank server with no other functions, so there is no way for hackers to exploit it to gain access to the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HoneyBee was built from the ground up using Python 3.6. A demo environment for testing purposes was also set up in Cisco Packet Tracker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cisco Packet Tracker is very difficult to work with, but there were not any other programs that could be used to accurately test this application. It was also difficult for us to combine our very different skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully completed a powerful tool for cybersecurity. With software like HoneyBee around the web, hackers would have a much harder time getting data from networks, especially if multiple HoneyBees were deployed on a single website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Cisco Packet Tracker as well as some Python networking. Both of us benefited from the other's knowledge about different subjects related to computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoneyBee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HoneyBee will continue to get updates to turn it into a widespread, easy-to-use tool for cyber defense. Later updates will bring cloud syncing, allowing multiple networks to share a single blacklist of IPs. This will quickly put a stop to attackers, as those who attempt to attack one network will quickly find themselves locked out of many other networks worldwide. Despite its apparent simplicity, HoneyBee is a powerful tool to increase cyber defense and stop hackers.
