                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Common housing problems encountered within the MSU College of Law Housing Clinic revolve around a lack of education and proper protocol for addressing repair issues. We wanted to simply be able to walk tenants through the process without having financial ability be a factor that decreases access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walk tenants through the process regarding repair issues - and a possible referral service for housing attorneys in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we process mapped the actual process a tenant would take in order to address a repair issue - whether a tenant can actually withhold rent, depending on the repair. After that we determined a logic within the process map. Then we translated the logic into questions and steps to walk the tenant through the process.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we had wanted this to be a part of the android application -

                    </a>
                    but as time went on we determined that it wouldn't be a feasible option given the restraints. As a result, we wanted to have a minimally viable product to showcase, and therefore switched gears to create the html site.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A non-coder team member was able to create the logic within html and have a product to showcase to the judges.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To have different options (switching to html) when planning, since there are situations that will arise (like time) that we need to account for.

                    We would like to see this embedded into the application we built -
