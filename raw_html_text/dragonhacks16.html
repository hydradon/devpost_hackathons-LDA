                    This is a Gym activity tracker using a single Myo or 2 Myos combined.
It has all the features combined together as it includes features as accelerotometer and emg data.

                    GyMyo is programmed to find our if you are performing

                    </strong>

It also has the previous feature of

Myo is generally an armband used for Gesture based detection. We tweaked it to be used as a
                    <strong>
                        gym band
                    </strong>
                    that finds out the different activities done in gym and the in the later version planning to include a calorie tracker too based on the calories burnt per exercise.

                <p>
                    V 1.2
We have included a calorie calculator too that would give a notification as to how many calories have been burnt.
