                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we are now able to transcribe subtitles for any video in any language, we noticed that there is no technology that facilitates audio-to-audio translation in real time. Oftentimes, when watching a video &ndash; such as a foreign movie or TV show &ndash; in another language with subtitles, attention is diverted away from the picture onscreen and focused more on the text at the bottom, which can detract from the viewing experience altogether. This audio-to-audio translation therefore allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the video they are watching, and concurrently eliminates the need for film/TV companies to rerecord their productions in other languages.

                    This android application converts any video  that's provided by a user and converts it to a new video with it's audio translated into any language specified by the user.

                    <li>
                        Since there aren't any APIs to convert speech to speech, we had to first go from Speech to text, and then text to speech.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Synced speech with the video with right amount of pause. We had to create our own algorithm to do this
