                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time constraints made it difficult to ship a finished product. Several team members did not know how to develop any sort of app.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members knew how to code an app at the beginning of the project. By the end, we had a completed app and website.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to manage a team, work with Arduino, and develop for the web and android.

                <p>
                    The next step is to implement graphics into the game like are seen in the demo images, and add more involved mechanics to make the game more engaging.
