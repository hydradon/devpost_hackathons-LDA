                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know about the star signs but we often mistake our compatibility cause it not always depends on one's star sign element and basic features, etc. So, we tried to create a more personalized dating app that will let you know what exact zodiac is compatible according to your personal choices/preferences/interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app basically takes a short quiz along with your name and zodiac and gives you a resultant zodiac according to the answers you provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back end with python and the front end with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To connect the back end and front end, learn css and create an algorithm for the result to print.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created both the back end and front end which we hadn't expected to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt what all we need to create a web app and how to make it more presentable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ZodiacMingle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on including real-time users like any other dating app but will be selected related to the zodiacs. We also plan on expanding the database for better results.
