                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to bring awareness and acceptance to children with special needs. In middle and high school special needs students are often neglected or isolated when interacting with other kids. This platform introduces and fosters relationships between these students at a young age in order to build the foundation of a more inclusive community.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating an account and filling out a quick survey, PlayPals pairs two elementary aged children, one with special needs and the other a general education student, from anywhere across the U.S. together and provides them with a platform to interact, learn, and have fun. With video chatting and additional features such letting kids read and play puzzles with each other, we aid in building an inclusive community.
