                        Why Women?
                    </strong>
                    Women are often bombarded by media to look a certain way and to follow the latest fad diet (e.g low-carb, keto), This often leads to an unhealthy relationship with food; we learn to see it as an enemy that keeps us from achieving our goals. We hope to
                    <strong>
                        empower women
                    </strong>
                    to cultivate a healthy relationship with food and see it as fuel and nutrition to keep our bodies
                    <strong>
                        strong
                    </strong>
                    .
Women often have different nutritional depending on the stage of life they are in. For example, during pregnancy women should increase their consumption of folic acid, calcium, and other vitamins and post-menopausal women should increase their calcium intake.

                        Why Low-Income?
                    </strong>
                    There are numerous apps that offer personalized diet plans&hellip; for a cost. These tailored health plans can be inaccessible to low-income communities. Our vision is to create a free resource that creates the opportunity to make healthy eating
                    <strong>
                        accessible to all communities

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The foods we eat are a key component to our overall health and energy levels. Unfortunately, cost and education make healthy eating more difficult for low-income people. If we can create opportunities for healthy eating and resources for food education,
                    <strong>
                        we can increase the health of our low-income communities
