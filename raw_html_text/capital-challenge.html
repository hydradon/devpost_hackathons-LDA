                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this skill was to help my 3rd grade daughter learn her state capitals and provide fun state facts along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Capital Challenge is a fun way to learn state capitals using Amazon Echo devices and Alexa.  Participants will be asked to provide the name of the state, the name of the capital or alternate between the two depending on how they choose to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Capital Challenge using .NET Core and C#.  The skill is hosted in AWS Lambda with game assets like images and audio files hosted in S3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would say that the biggest challenge was designing for voice interaction and accounting for input that you didn't expect.  People say the darndest things!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm most proud that my daughter is using my skill to learn her state capitals and it shows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice design is unlike any other interaction channel and one that requires careful thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Capital Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to look for ways to expand the depth of the game to ensure people keep coming back to learn more and have some fun at the same time.
