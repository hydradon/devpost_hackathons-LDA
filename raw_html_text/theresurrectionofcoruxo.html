                        Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, the camera offset depending on how many legs was tricky. Indeed, a new leg unlocks a bigger offset for the camera, but that is not only horizontal! In fact, some places had a vertical offset (up or down or both), and everything had to be perfectly smooth for the player to feel the story and be totally immersed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, having a perfectly drawn background going with the music was a small challenge for our artist that did an amazing job to overcome it!

                        What we learned
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about 2D animation, sprite rendering as well as programming. Some of the scripts such as the Camera offset were more than 200 lines long, which enhanced our programming skills and problem-solving skills as well.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, one must not forget that we came here to enjoy our work. We are proud of being able to finish the complete game before deadline and of course enjoyed building it from scratch.
