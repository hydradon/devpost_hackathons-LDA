                    Convenience and engaging social experience: these are two factors which truck drivers often lack on the job. Given the considerable rise in the demand for these employees around the nation, we wanted to develop a chatbot which would help motivate them to take on this infamously tedious and isolating task.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            One of the most difficult aspects of this application was developing a solid training model with our data set, how could we make something which is both entertaining for the user and convenient when needed? So we made a choice on which elements of our chatbot would serve most beneficial to our target user.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Another challenge was figuring out how to make a connection to Google's Cloud Services in a way that would increase our chatbot's performance especially when it came to learning from a massive dataset. We wanted to run the entire bot from a GCP VM, as this would streamline efficiency and ease of use, however streaming input speech became a challenge when dealing with the cloud VM. Ultimately we determined a reliable _ local _ build would be most practical at the cost of computing efficiency.
