                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that the online advertisement industry has become a rather despised industry due to providing little value to the consumer. Due to this, we wanted to explore a way to provide more value to the customer by allowing them to redirect some of the revenue based on their participation in the advertisement industry to causes that they care about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We automated a web advertisement delivery platform to target audiences that have a desire to contribute a very small portion of their internet usage time to organizations that support their causes. We have a Chrome application that delivers targeted advertisements at user selected intervals (30min, 1hour, 4hours, etc.) and provides feedback on the amount of user contribution as well as total organization contribution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application on a website/chrome extension platform. We stored data in the backend on MariaDB and ran our servers from a PHP platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues with integrating Google API to our application. We had a lot of issues implementing the windows popup screen through the Google Extension API. On a higher-level, we had some issues zoning in on a viable idea for the Hackathon, but we are glad we were able to finish this project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished it! We also we are very proud of actually being able to work as a team to complete this project despite initial disagreements on the direction of the project. We feel that it was a wonderful experience and we learned a lot with respect to program design as well as program implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that, while carrying out a design from the ground up is difficult, the true difficulty lies within the ability to face those challenges as a team and not throwing out an idea because it seems difficult. In addition, we learned much about website development and server side control. From utilizing new tools such as Google's API to sharpening our existing stack of HTML and PHP, we have made the most of this experience and had a wonderful time.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will take the judges/peers opinions into consideration as well as do some more business side analysis on the feasibility of furthering this project. Perhaps, you'll be able to see it live and fully functional soon!
