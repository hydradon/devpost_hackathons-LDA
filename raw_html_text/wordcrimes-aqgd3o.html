                </h2>
                <p>
                    You, the player, are a detective in the field, and the only resource you have is an AI that is trained to connect clues.
Your task is to find the right word associations among a grid of words, using hints given by the AI computer. But if you
guess the wrong words too many times, you wont have accurate enough clues to solve the case.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The player selects one word at a time from a grid, and must select all of the correct words to win.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They are given hints by the AI, each consisting of a word, and the number of words that it is related to in the grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a word is correctly chosen, it is highlighted green. Otherwise, it is highlighted red.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For every incorrectly guessed word, the player gets a strike. It is too late to connect the right words after three strikes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
