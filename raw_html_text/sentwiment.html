                    Twitter is a platform where a dynamic range of opinions and emotions are expressed by a wide variety of people making it an effective tool to use data for many research applications such as political, financial, sentiment analysis etc. Our goal with this project was to give researchers who need this data an effective way to analyze the sentiments of Tweets. We use Natural Language Processing, a form of machine learning, to analyze a set of tweets for their polarity or sentiment. Once we had completed the back end, we made a front end website that would be run locally on the users machine. This front end website connected to our back end using a framework called Flask. Our next steps include making a more refined language processing model and getting our project fully uploaded to the web.
