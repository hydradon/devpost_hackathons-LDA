                    AccelScreen uses the sensor fusion built into your Android device to combine measurements from your accelerometer, gyrometer, magnometer, and other sensors to build a high quality model of where it is located in space.  It uses this to provide a window onto a larger virtual screen, which can span an entire tabletop.
