                    This is the first time I have coded in Swift and Xcode for a long time. As expected, relearning the language wasn't easy, but it was doable. 
Since this was my first Hackaton, I didn't know what to do for most of the duration. I came with two other friends, and we all did our own things. My project was the longest and most in-depth which is why we're submitting mine. 
What the app does:
The app is really front end. Like almost completely. It's what it does that counts. What I decided to do was just have some fun and create an app that blatantly roasts all my friends (all in good fun). The app is essentially a ton of funny images with labels/other images roasting them. It's pretty self-explanatory if you watch the video. It's all in good fun. Let loose and have a good laugh.
