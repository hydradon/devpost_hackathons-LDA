                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous experiences with hospitals stays taught us how you are left in the dark about future examinations and procedures. Most of the time, these appointments are set but not communicated to the patient. When we started thinking about possible hackathon project ideas this came immediately to our minds.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app gives a transparent overview over appointments and schedules via a built-in calendar, Amazon Alexa provides this information even to those unable to use a mobile device. There are two modes to the app: Children will receive a special layout which has been optimized for children, with data being made more simple. Children will be guided by the mascot called Bob. Bob encourages the child to be strong and will be able to provide health tips. Parents and adults can use the app without the changes, seeing all relevant medical information.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using a webserver to enable communication between Android clients and Alexa. The webserver also serves as a secure way to store the data centrally. Alexa functionality uses AWS Lambda functions to execute and manage reposnses in a almost server-less way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started building the infrastructure to support the app, programming a backend with Node.js. Initially we planned on using the Kontakt.io Kits in our project but we only had time to work with the kit when Kontakt.io-Staff was already home, and support was unresponsive. Due to miscommunication we were unable to incorporate Kontakt.io into our project.
Building for Amazon Alexa proved difficult as well since documentation was lacking in many areas. Luckily we discovered these problems early enough to be able to resolve them with Amazon-Staff.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a almost complete platform which the individual parts being mostly fleshed out. There are many more features we wish to build into our product but for 23 hours we believe we built a presentable project.
