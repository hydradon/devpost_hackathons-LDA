                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tableau is an expensive GUI for making interactive graphics.  Despite it's price, it has many flaws. A free and better version should exist in 2015.  D3 is a javascript library for creating svg and canvas visualizations.  It has a steep learning curve and is inaccessible to many people who would like to create non-standard visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One data source (json via get request), one analysis (comparative word count)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polymer, javascript, bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first experience with Polymer.  I made some incorrect assumptions about the framework that cost me time and altered my original design.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get a working demo put together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polymer, time management, the importance of dependency management.
