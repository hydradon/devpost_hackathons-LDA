                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps developers and companies find other enthusiast devs that use similar technologies. This promotes the development of open source software and increases your professional network. 
Besides that, it gives the employees a tool for finding passionate students and attract them for their jobs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is written in Python, which calls the GitHub REST API in order to generate the user/company profile used in matching. The data is displayed on a responsive website which uses Flask alongside a high responsive Google Javascript framework, AngularJS, which provides a full MVC architecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time building any type of web app using Python &amp; AngularJS, never used Flask before and we made some "rookie" mistakes.
                    <strong>
                        There was lots of StackOverflow-ing
                    </strong>
                    . Besides that, we spent an important period of time to design the architecture of the project, in order to make it scalable for a big number of users and to build a friendly API from the Git HTTP requests.
Later in the project we realized some data from the GitHub API is a bit power intensive to obtain. But overall we managed to overcome all challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a client-server, architecture, build a complete API from scratch, create an user friendly and responsive website and managing to finish the project within the hackathon time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Flask and the way it manages CSS for example (it's painful), how various architectures and design patterns work and how to optimize web operations, which was good practice for our web dev skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for git connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future plans can include a cleaner UI and UX. Better GitHub OAuth and maybe a GitHub market app implementation.
In addition to this, we thought about implementing a suggestion machine learning algorithm in order to provide feed for users according to their various needs.
