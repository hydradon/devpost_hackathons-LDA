                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and pet finders API to get the shelters and put information about the user to fire base we also make it so if your eager about getting the specific pet you can even call the shelter or email them with their contact information we provided within the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    implementing the API smoothly without crashing and getting the location to work before they sign in and before the dead line
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    working with the API with little to no bugs (because nothing is a 100% bug proof not even Raid)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a better understanding of android studios, fire base, APIs, working through tremendous bugs and when you want to give up you don't because the amount of knowledge you learn after words is enough to make you better. Data is the Primary Key its not Foreign to us.

                <p>
