                    Inspiration- Mieux Accueillir, Mieux Vivre.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a mobile app that was universal for both the community members and tourists alike. We as students and graduates of Bishops University haven't had the chance to explore Sherbrooke and everything it has to offer. We hope with this application it will allow for everyone to explore the city around then and enjoy new things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app starts with a scroll view of a list of categories. Once you choose one of the categories you are shown a list of results. Within the result page (at the bottom) there is a closed ended question. Based on the answer, will filter the results of the search to be more specific for the user. After you answer one question, another one appears, until you find the place you want or until there are no more questions. If you really like a place you may save it to your favourites and access it on the home page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we decided how to divide the work and some worked on the code within Xcode while others developed the design and theme. The first team worked on the constraints, implementing classes, and making the code work together. While the second team chose a colour scheme, formatted questions, and designed the layout of the mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since two of our members were unfamiliar with swift, finding other projects to use all of our team members was a task but as a group we determined what each could do and it all worked out. One of our programmers had an issue with the constraints and worked hard until they fit every screen perfectly. We wanted to use the YELP api to implement ratings on our restaurants but unfortunately were unable to implement this within the allocated time. We also had an issue finding a character within a string using swift to be able to use to narrow results based on dining times/offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our app has a basic framework but we built it up to be unique and more complex. We are very proud of how much information we gathered, implemented and designed within the time restraints of the competition. We are also proud of our time management and group communication. If we did not focus on these two aspects we may not have been able to get every thing we did get done done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to apply learned class concepts and apply them to real world problems. Some group members learned how to program in the swift language. We also never had to program in groups, it was difficult at first to delegate tasks but with time and patience everyone participated and programs intertwined nicely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SherVivre
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to limited time, we had to focus on creating a working prototype. We have great plans for SherVivre like:
1.Add events to a randomization to plan an evening (random choice of restaurant &amp; activity) 2.Create a dislike folder; The user can choose to never see a location they do not like 3.Multiple language compatible 4.YELP restaurant rating(also give an option to user to sort via rating) 5.Public services (i.e. garbage schedule, bus schedule, hospital locations)6.The map -centre it on the users location
