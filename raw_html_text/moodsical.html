                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times we search spotify for playlists that we want to fit our mood but we can never find them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IOS and Android app that generates a playlist from spotify based on a series of moods (joy, anger, sadness, depression, and love)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using cordova js, spotify api, node js and ionic which translates html and css into app code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify playlists not generating the way we wanted to. Aesthetic problems with the app. Many others as well
                </p>
