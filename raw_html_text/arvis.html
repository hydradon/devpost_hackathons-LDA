                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were scrolling through the list of categories for this year's Technica, and competitions for the best programs during a crisis and for spreading education and diversity caught our attention. Since we were all passionate about at least one subject, we decided to create a chatbot that could educate people on the different subjects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, the chatbot prompts the user with different buttons, each pertaining to a different subject. Based on the user's choice, the program will return information relating to the subject of the button press.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react to build the chatbot, and a combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build around the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges in trying to get the bot to work using react, but help from mentors and research helped to better the challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arvis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the topics Arvis will educate people about, and become a more widespread application where people can learn about different topics from a reliable source.
