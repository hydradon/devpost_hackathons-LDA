                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have to wait 4-5 years to elect an official or person in power who may potentially not achieve anything meaningful during his time. This simple addition to Envel puts the power and ownership of the community back into their hands. A single dollar may not achieve much, but a million one dollars will.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an option for Envel users to donate residue cash from daily budget to a local charity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our concept design was built through photoshop and premiere pro. Photoshop allowed us to easily manipulate and experiment with potential UI elements. Then we brought life to our static ideas by animating them in premiere pro. This allowed us to experience the possible user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing an attractive and alluring interface was our primary challenge. Incentivizing users to participate in activities charitable in nature is inherently difficult. As a result, we ran through many designs until we felt like the entire process was as frictionless and as inviting as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was able to conceptualize an application function and effectively materialize the concepts within our very strict time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What businesses do is not single faceted. With the current ever-evolving industry, businesses must adapt and grasp these facets in order to survive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The power of the dollar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, our Design concept is still only a concept. Our next step would be to work with backend developers to actually program our design to the application and tackle any potential problems that we may encounter.
