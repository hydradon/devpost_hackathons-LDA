                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many tools are available for text auto-completion: spell check, voice command; however none are available to finish off a text with an appropriate emoji. We want to make the world a better place by providing everybody with our tool, so that everybody can emojify their sentences.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EmojiNinja can look inside your heart and your mind and 100% accurately make your message complete with the emoji your message needs. Emoji is life
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a node.js web chat we made using sockets. At the heart of the project is a neural network which analyzes the sentence and suggests an emoji.
