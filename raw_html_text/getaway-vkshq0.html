                    What we've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have realized the limitation about bus service in Hong Kong where the route may not cover some of the places and the bus schedule is not accurate. If we need to solve this situation, it is necessary to track the GPS location of the bus and provide api for developers to use. All we can do is to suggest our users to avoid some foreseeable traffic jam situations and change their plan as a divergence purpose of GetAway. Moreover, the GPS that enabled the users to use the app function is very significant for developers. As GetAway need to utilize the GPS location to locate how many users in one specific spot and provide the realtime information to other app users. That's why more users of an app can provide more accurate information and generate a better user experience.

                <p>
                    Stage 1:
We plan to spend the first month to fine-tune the prototype (prototyping, iterating, testing). This should be consolidated with extensive user testing. Then we plan to spend 3 months to code the product and launch beta version on iOS and Android market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stage 2:
We will start to promote it through social media advertisement and hiking communities in Hong Kong. By doing this, we will start to have real users using our product. We will then gather user feedback from them to continue improving the user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stage 3:
When a mass numbers of users registered our platform, we have more data on hand and we are able to utilize those data to optimize users experience. For example, those reviews for the countryside spots help users to better understand the sight.
