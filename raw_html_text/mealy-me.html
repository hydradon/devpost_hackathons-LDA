                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mealy.me is a novel way of dining. It utilizes meal-sharing technology to improve the dining experience at UMass Amherst. We utilize an Android app and IBM cloud services, to allow users to share their meals with one another. Our project will make dining cheaper for people who do not have meal plans and will save money for people with meal swipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever ran out of meal swipes? Or had too many? We're here to bring back the balance and provide a platform to sell your extra meal swipes to hungry souls around campus. Yes, you're welcome.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are pretty new to web server design and development. There were also issues we ran into when integrating the app with the web server. One of the major challenges involved writing web server code from scratch. We used python, databases, bluemix and google APIs for the first time!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a Python Wizard.

                <p>
                    We are pretty excited about our team and individual accomplishments. Each of us learnt something new through this hack and enjoyed hacking web pages, building servers and going live.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing webpages in python! Database structuring and android app development.

                    What's next for Mealy.Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to see our app be used by UMass peeps on campus. We are excited to use it ourselves. There is definitely a lot of improvement we can make to displaying dining hall menus and improving the entire user experience for our app.
