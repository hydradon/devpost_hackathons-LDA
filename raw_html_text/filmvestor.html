                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was taking  a film class when I came up with an idea, what if we can raise money for films and distribute differently? This idea was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People set up a budget for how much they need for production of their film, and then regular people can use Paypal or eCommerce payments to fund the film at any amount. We take a 3% royalty for every film after its released. Here are the details of how it works:
​
A partner website or theatre can sign up through the platform
A production company or investor (person) signs up for the platform.
The production company works with us to create a crowdfunding campaign, let us say they are raising $25000 for 30% royalties in their film.
People donate any amount of money between $1 to $10000 in the film using paypal or a third party checkout button
Once the campaign is fully funded, the production company has a 10 month period to finish the film.
Once they finish the film, they submit it &amp; it gets published through the partner websites &amp; theatres that signed up, and a system keeps track of the royalties.
The royalties are distributed equally on auto pilot for the duration of the site.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a customized CSS and HTML theme. We made it compatible with Android and Ouya as well as start the development of a future smart car app for Mojio as well as started development for an IOS app. All the graphics were custom made such as the logo, comics, and social media pages. We have set up a GitHub page as well, used Google Trends for SEO, and made custom trailers using Apple IMovie.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to focus on creativity, time, and user experience. I am not gonna lie, at some points it was tough to customize.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished, and whether we win or lose we still have a good site
                </p>

                <p>
                    We learned how to customize themes better

                <p>
                    We may try getting an investor or going to a startup incubator program, we will finish the smart car app and the IOS app, and we may sell the site or see what we can do with it.
