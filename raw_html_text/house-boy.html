                    What Inspired me?
In our day to day life, we spend a majority of time at home or at the office. Often we tend to forget where have we kept certain items like keys, wallets, kitchen items etc.
I observed this common problem where I or anyone of my family member has kept the item somewhere and later searching it throughout the home.
For Example: My Mom keeps a lot of snacks items in kitchen drawers. When I hungry and Mom is not available I struggle to find it and end up opening all the drawers to find just one pack of biscuit.
                    <br>
                    Other Example: My Dad keeps important documents in the locker somewhere and when Mom needs it she always has to call up Dad for locating it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to come up with some solution which can help in day to day routine tasks like remembering things, welcoming guest, greet people. So was pondering upon this and at midnight
                    <strong>
                        1:19 AM
                    </strong>
                    the idea of "House Boy" was borned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does?
Currently
                    <strong>
                        House Boy
                    </strong>
                    provides are simple and effective solution for being a household companion for day to day tasks.

                    How I built it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into?
One of the challenges I face was to save family members by name. I wanted to give a very personalized experience to the users. 
For example: If Alexa is asked "Where is My wallet? ", Alexa should know who the "My" word is referring to. Because many members of the home can have a wallet.
So I had to make sure that I ask and save the names of users and at the same time maintain a smooth user experience.
