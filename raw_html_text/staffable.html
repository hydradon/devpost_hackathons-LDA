                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students, especially at UC Berkeley, often have 1-2 free hours in between classes. 1-2 hours is not enough to make a trip home, but it IS enough to work minimal shift at a nearby restaurant and make a quick buck.

                    Meet Staffable, the mobile application that uses Google Cloud databases to provide a directory of active employers and employees. Think of Tinder, but for short-term low-skill employment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode/Objective C to build an IOS app. We developed and implemented our own API using a local Flask server and used Google Cloud's Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginning hackers, we ran into many challenges. Learning Objective C on the go was extremely difficult, and implementing Firebase and Flask, as well as data structures and data processing for the first time made for a grueling but extremely rewarding first hackathon. We hope to participate in more future hackathons, especially future CalHacks events!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are VERY proud of our work: from developing an elegant GUI and front-end to implementing data structures far beyond our previous capabilities, this hackathon was a success for us. We learned new computer languages and frameworks, and overall discovered excitement for computer science.
