                    By detecting your beta brain waves through muse, Zen will know whether you're concentrating or whether you&rsquo;re relaxing. You can stay focused without being distracted by people contacting you through technology. The sender will instead receive a message back saying that &ldquo;[Insert Name] is currently busy. Your messages will be sent when they are available.&rdquo; Whenever the wearer decides to take a break, Zen will detect it and unblock your digital world, flushing the message backlog and updating you on what you've missed.
                </p>

                    From a manager's standpoint, this can allow employees to keep focused, and the server can also track when and which employees are most focused and productive. This allows the manager to optimize teams and schedules.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Mobile platforms don't allow apps to toggle airplane mode, so the only way we can get this effect is by going through a web server that uses Twilio to act as a middleman between the texter and the textee. This added an additional layer of complexity, as there had to be a remote backend that connected to the local server. It also means that the user has to forward his or her number to Twilio.

                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    While video games hold your attention, they don't really work your brain very hard.
Leaning forward actually does improve concentration, and leaning back makes you more relaxed.
