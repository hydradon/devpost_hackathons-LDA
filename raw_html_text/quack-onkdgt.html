                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story is often told of a
                    <em>
                        Little Ugly Duckling
                    </em>
                    who didn't fit in with his family. He was not accepted as a beautiful duckling, and was always pushed aside by his brothers, sisters, and everyone around him. This ugly duckling did not get the respect he deserved, but was not alone as almost each duck family has at least one ugly duckling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Approximately
                    <strong>
                        1 in 6
                    </strong>
                    people in the United Kingdom are affected by hearing loss. This ratio is extremely large and as it is continuously growing around the world, our team felt that these people should not be left out, should not feel alone, and should not feel like the ugly duckling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We feel that the world needs to be educated. The world needs to learn the language of the unspoken, to be able to converse with, include, and respect those who are hard of hearing. With this, we created Quack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quack is a program that uses Leap Motion to teach and test your knowledge of basic American Sign Language through physically signing as well as identifying signs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used existing open-sourced code and developed on it to improve the learning experience that it provides for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we came across was never having played with or programmed a Leap Motion sensor before. We spent some time exploring and testing out the device and in the end were able to create Quack.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we created a very study-friendly, easy-to-navigate system for learning American Sign Language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the course of this hackathon, we learned how to implement the redis server using python.

                    What's next for Quack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While developing Quack, we noticed a lot of minor issues with the user interface, which we hope to improve in the near future.
