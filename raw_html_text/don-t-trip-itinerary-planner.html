                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of a satisfactory itinerary planner and frequent use of Reddit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users would post photos from their vacation.  We would then geolocate the photos based on EXIF data and plot their itineraries. Other users could view these itineraries and "upvote" and "downvote" so only the best would be on the top.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built everything in JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble overlaying photos with the GoogleMapsAPI and connecting our front-end with our back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we came up with an idea that we feel is unique and useful.  We also made really good progress on the idea despite not finishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To brainstorm more before the hackathon. Also learned a lot about how to use database systems and create a user system that allows for only one action per user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don't Trip --Itinerary Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could finish connecting all of our backend ideas. We could also use different APIs to provide restaurants or hotels to users to provide a complete plan for users.
