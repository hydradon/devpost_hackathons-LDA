                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inconvenience of visiting several websites and going through multiple pages to find the optimal mountain conditions and trail types. Also, we wanted to experiment with several different assets at our disposal that we had not used before such as nodejs and jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It summarizes the conditions, weather, and trails/lifts in real time, whilst giving you an immersive online experience complete with pictures and links to the website for buyer friendliness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started with a raw css, js, and html webpage using materialize css. Then we used web scrapers to sift through the large amounts of data on the ski websites and find real time weather and snow depth reports. Also we used a DreamHost hosting service to post our website online. Our dedication was so full that we actually spent a dollar on the domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web scraping is really really challenging. And also the responsiveness across screen sizes is also not optimal so we had to partially manually adjust it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we finished it on time and that it is such a simple and promising and useful site makes us very proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned all sorts of new assets for future projects (such as coding languages and hosting sites) we also learned that we cannot make infinite power loops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SkiWeb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making another great and innovative project that will be of use to the masses. Such as expanding our current service to include more mountains and promoting higher-level web scraping techniques.
