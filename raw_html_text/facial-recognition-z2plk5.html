                    A team member had their interests on the Gait approach, gait analysis. We decided to explore around these options with facial recognition, machine learning, and computer vision to understand how we would be able to create a profile for each person.

                    Explored through package installations and examples of how the human pose estimation algorithm would be implemented with Tensorflow.
