                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our deep passion for food. Sometimes, we have this one ingredient in your fridge that you never use, and we would like to create an app to help us use those ingredients in those situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will auto generate meal options when you input an ingredient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift on XCode, and used TheMealDB API for the meal and ingredient data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with parsing the data returned from the API, and implementing the user interface. We also didn't really know how to use GitHub and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn the entire Swift language in 24 hours., along with learning how to make iOS apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The language of swift, using GitHub to push/pull/commit, graphic design, how to use APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodMan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team plans on improving FoodMan as it isn't full complete. The final product of food man was intended to spit out recipes and ethnic backgrounds of the food. The various APIs that we planned on using all had paid access. If food man does blow up, we'll use adds to pay for the access to these APIs, allowing us to further optimize FoodMan. With the user interface, we intend to add image previews of the meals and more eye-candy.
