                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes the batteries in our phones die quickly, preventing our friends or family from contacting us. Especially in the case of an emergency, it would be convenient if there was some way for our friends and family to communicate with each other without necessarily having the other's contact information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to create a profile, where they can add up to five top friends, and five top family members. In the case of an emergency, these circles of friends and families of the user can communicate through the messenger component of this app. Conversely, the user can access the family or friends circles of others who have added him/her to one of their circles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Firebase iOS platform to create and hold a database of users, their personal information such as phone number, and their connection circles. We used XCode to design and construct the app's UI and layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time at a hackathon and making an app, so we had a significant amount to learn about XCode, Swift, and using Firebase. Accessing the friends and family members from the database was a great obstacle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the great amount of information that we learned, especially implementing the database, and the visual appearance of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Swift and XCode, JSON, and Firebase. Additionally, we became very good at Googling unfamiliar topics.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement the messenger feature, as well as an authentication feature for logins.
