                    I was looking into Best Graph Database Search and Compare (EDR) among the prizes. Creating a pattern matching algorithm to select records from the database interests me. I looked more into it, but realized that this idea applied to graphs is beyond my abilities. Therefore, I tried to learn about pattern matching algorithms within the context of text. The idea of using hashing to solve the problem interested me, so I decided to learn about the Karp-Rabin algorithm. I also learned a lot about hashing, prime numbers, and complexity.
