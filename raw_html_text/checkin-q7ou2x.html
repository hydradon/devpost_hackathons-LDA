                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent flu outbreak and its impact on community health. Social Media is known for its ability to impact virality, and so we decided to turn this into something positive with an emphasis on infectious diseases such as the flu.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product uses self-reported user data to create a real-time contagion tracking system in the form of a map. Users can access these maps which additionally inform decision-making about travel in impacted areas and local healthcare providers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We approached this product through a methodical and community-focused lens. First, we surveyed physicians and other healthcare providers alongside community leaders such as teachers from areas of low SES. These responses informed our trajectory in building a solution for community health in a sustainable, functional, and easily integrable way. Next, we conducted research on health needs by focusing on recent issues occurring in the news, leading us to consider the impact of contagion in infectious diseases such as the flu. Following this, we researched viable solutions to empower individuals in healthcare-- noting apps that have been successful, taking into consideration statistics for healthcare app use in general, and popular apps that rely on community as well, such as Snapchat and Lyft. As part of our implementation, we modeled our product using wireframing through Adobe XD. We were able to show the interfaces we want the user to experience in our final application. Simultaneously, we created an Android application to bring our wireframe dream to life.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a software that is currently in beta posed challenges on the development side. We started development using Mendix, a seemingly easy to use interface to help create easy to use applications. However, we later faced obstacles which caused us to switch to making our mobile application in Android Studio. There was also difficulty in extrapolating information from data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to complete the Adobe XD wireframe. We also carried out extensive market research. At the beginning of the project, we surveyed doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals in order to get a sense of fundamental needs in hospital settings and among individuals from underprivileged backgrounds .

                    <strong>
                        It&rsquo;s never too late to start over.
                    </strong>
                    We learned the difficulty of working within a software that is in Beta (Mendix). We acquired rapid prototyping skills via the Adobe XD software.
