                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nashville is trying to become the next smart city. They have open data  on a lot of public services and culture. Our initiative was to incorporate smart city data into an Amazon Alexa app to find parks, art, history, etc. This will hopefully teach people about Nashville and get them to be more active and go outside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Amazon Alexa skill queries Nashville Open Data for information on a variety of data collected by the city of Nashville. You can even ask which parks have picnic spots or about Nashville sculptures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using AWS, Amazon Developer, Amazon Echo, Serverless, and the SODA API. We used Javascript and node.js.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This was our first hackathon ever!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was our first time developing with an Echo, AWS, Lambda, Open Data API, and the Alexa-SDK
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa-SDK is complex
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HTTPS request module took multiple tries to implement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two of us were familiar with node.js and software development, while it was the first time coding with node.js for our other 2 members.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was our first time using the Open Data API.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We can ask Amazon Alexa about multiple ameneties of parks in Nashville.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned a lot about Open Data, javascript, and Alexa programming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We see huge potential for this in other cities. It is as simple as changing the API links.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write Amazon Alexa skills, which we have never done before.
                </p>

                    *We would like to implement cards, so that when you ask about a park, a card pushes a picture and an address to your phone

                    <li>
                        We would like to add more natural and parametrized utterances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to see this implemented across other cities! The SODA API has data for other cities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to be able to query the closest park. We have the proper Google Maps API, but did not have time to implement it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, we would like to implement 2 slots per query.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We would like to add Alexa to wearables so you can ask about Nashville on the fly.
