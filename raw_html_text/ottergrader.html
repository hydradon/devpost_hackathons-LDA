                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scantrons are expensive, and not very portable. Nowadays, almost everybody has a smartphone. With OtterGrader, teachers no longer have to purchase specialized Scantron forms or equipment to create simple tests. The only equipment necessary are a computer and camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first half of the program allows you to generate a test. Currently, we only support true/false question types and automatically export a file that can be easily printed. When students have filled out the test, teachers simply have to take a picture of the exam, run it through the grading system, and get the score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is coded using python and the GUI uses kivy. Our image recognition uses the open source computer vision library, OpenCV, to automatically score the test.
