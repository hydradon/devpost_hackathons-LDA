                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought out a project that would be challenging within the time allotted for the hackathon. we might have come up short, we're still proud nonetheless!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It rolls dice, gathers resources for the players based upon the dice rolls, and has the cation robber
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using only the pygame library for Python, we started by mapping out the Catan rules, then coded our way up from there!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hexagonal grids and Graph Traversal where there is a multitude of cycles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hexagonal Grid implementation
The texture loading
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    graph traversal problems always sound easy on paper
use a library in future to generate hexagonal grids
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Catan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    not sure.... probably a full implementation at some point!
                </p>
