                    My two great teammates, Imtiaz and Adarsh worked long and hard to get the cross platform User Interface working. All the while, myself, Hugh, and my mentor James Brady were working on the API Interface for our back-end AWS server. There were struggles, there was strife. We went through highs and lows, but one thing that always remained constant was out friendship and comradery, which carried us through to the end.
