                        There is a growing disconnection between people and the items they use. This is notable as the Generation Z cohort increasingly adapts to technology, despite a growing abstraction between the system and the user.

                        Although there are many massive breaches, many of them are posed as foreign actors acting aggressively when often enough, the vulnerability is simple and committed by a sole individual.

                        Hackathons are focused on building projects. As xkcd references, towards the deadline, code quality often gets thrown out the window. Lower code quality is simply prone to more vulnerabilities.

                    openSec is a non-profit platform that aims to bring quality cybersecurity education
to students of all ages. openSec is track-based, and relies on a CTF/wargames style-manner
in order to foster problem-solving and competition.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan built the backend, and Alan worked on the front end and server for the CTF/wargame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    openSec's CTF platform is built with Python's Flask API, as well as responsive HTML/CSS.
openSec is hosted on a physical server at the moment, running Ubuntu Server. The client and challenge
manager is built with C and Linux bash, utilizing the power of nCurses API for text user interfaces.

                <p>
                    C is a very low level language and Alan faced a lot of problems in terms of memory. nCurses is also very undocumented, and became a problem when he attempted to build the CTF management system.
We were not able to get AWS, so we had to rely on a local server to do the
