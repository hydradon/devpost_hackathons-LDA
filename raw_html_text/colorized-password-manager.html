                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw a post on a subReddit of a funny password generator that added a color code to a password for additional encryption. I had been wanting to create my own password manager for a while and decided these two ideas could merge well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prompts the user for a website to generate a password for, a base word, and a color. This data is sent through a Restful API server where a python script handles the calculations and returns the password to the client. They get their password and it is stored in a file on the server for later fetching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started by building a command line application with text-based input, then migrated core functionality to its own script and moved front-end to a C# form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult getting the server to work, as neither of us had any experience with servers before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a project in multiple languages was one of our goals at the beginning of the competition, and we're proud to say that we did just that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved our teamwork skills and our ability to explain our own code.

                    What's next for Colorized Password Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better UI, more options in the back-end for customization by website. Possible browser plugin.
