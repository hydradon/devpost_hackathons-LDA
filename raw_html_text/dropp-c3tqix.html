                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate Change is getting worse every year. And at the same time, people are ordering more and more products online, contributing tremendously to air pollution by shipping. We sought to build a product to meet modern shipping demands while also reducing our products' carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dropp is a peer to peer ground shipping service. It is an alternative to services like UPS which aren't very environmentally friendly. Dropp provides allows people to deliver packages while commuting along their regular route, and earn some extra cash along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When requesting for a package to be delivered, Dropp will find the best path to go through the network of deliverers' commute. This way, deliverers can drop packages on their commute, prioritizing those who use public transports to reduce the amount of pollution generated from the process. This additionally gives users can a real time map of their packages' position all the while having the peace of mind that they have reduced their carbon footprint by choosing Dropp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a mobile application using React Native and Expo to handle the user-facing interfaces for both the regular users and deliverers. The mobile app uses Google Maps to display the route and current status of the users' packages. It also includes a ML facial recognition algorithm when confirming that a package is delivered to verify that the package is delivered to the correct person. This mobile app contacts our Flask server to talk to the MongoDB database, process all of the deliverers' commutes through an advanced pathfinding algorithm, and notify the next commuter using Notivize if they're in the radar.io geofence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled a lot to get some of the APIs working, especially the Notivize for notifications. We also struggled with fitting the various moving parts and different constraints together, having to rethink our database multiple times after encountering various obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having such an advanced project with so many moving parts working by the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned about Node.js or Python. We also got to practice our React Native skills and use functional components' hooks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dropp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd love to better optimize our pathfinding algorithm but, most importantly, refine some of the user experience such as by separating the users and deliverers sections.
