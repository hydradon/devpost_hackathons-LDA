                    We wanted to build an app that would give us a good intro to mobile development.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It attempts to change someone's mood based on what they want to feel and what they really feel
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built it through android studio
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The challenges that we've faced were mostly aesthetics. We also had a lot of trouble writing specific tasks because we had limited prior knowledge.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud that we have a running app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned a lot of things including how to use the Android sdk and what it takes to write an Android application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Da Feelz.... Not much for the app; however, each of us will most likely go work on different projects on our own.
