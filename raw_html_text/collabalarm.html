                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We nearly missed our train on our way to Brown. I had to keep calling my friends to wake them up! That is why we built CollabAlarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CollabAlarm allows you to setup an alarm for the entire team and ensure that the whole team wakes on time every time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a native Android application with Spring running in the background to allow the phones to communicate and setup a group alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The network operations!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting up a working app at the end of it!
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <h2>
                    What's next for CollabAlarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make the group alarms more interesting by using voice messages from the user who first wakes up as a ringtone for the others who are still asleep.
