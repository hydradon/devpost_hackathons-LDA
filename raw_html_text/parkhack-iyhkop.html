                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know people can have situations were they get to school late and cannot find a parking spot because there is no way to tell if a deck is full before they get to the lot, creating a waste of time. This project is meant to assist and save time in finding spots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, it is a simulation that will notify students if there are available parking spots at GSU affiliated parking decks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using programming languages html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do not have much experience with backend so we created a simulation of what the webpage would do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to connect the decks with links that would generate a number of how many number of spots were available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained more experience on the programming languages that we used. We also learned that teamwork is very important and is vital to be successful and producing a completed project.
                </p>

                    What's next for myParkHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will focus on working on the back-end of the webpage to be able to connect to a real database with information linked to the school system.
