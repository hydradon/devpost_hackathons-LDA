                    What makes MentorSpace unique
Creates a platform to connect users who may not otherwise have access to each other. 
Horizontal mentoring relationships. People are not pigeonholed into strict mentor/mentoree roles, but rather can assume either role depending on the topic at hand and who they're talking with.
Emphasis on personal safety and quality relationship-building.
All-inclusive, but with an emphasis underrepresented in tech.

                    Features:
Create profiles outlining professional skills, interests, and goals, as well as indicate the desire to mentor and/or be mentored.
Search and filter profiles by occupation, skills, professional interests, and geographical location.
Formally request conversations and meetings through a chat application, video calling, etc. 
For in-person meetings, automatically determine safe, public spaces (coffee shops, book stores, etc) equidistant between user's locations.
Light scheduling capabilities to indicate when people are available for conversations. 
Automatic pair matching, dating-app style, utilizing AI/ML. 
Reviews of user interactions (ex: "this person was a no-show to our meeting").
Reporting system for users who behave inappropriately to maintain everyone&rsquo;s safety. 
Events page for things like meetups and hackathons with location check-in features to see who's shown up (and not just who said they were going to show up).
