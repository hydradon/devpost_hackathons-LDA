                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration from this app came from disliking one of my friends music tastes. Now, everyone has a say in what song comes on next!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iQueue is an iOS app in which people can vote for the upcoming song they want to play. By hosting the server on Google Cloud, you and your friends can control Spotify with only the iOS apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and the Spotipy API to add music and control playback. Google Cloud hosts the Python server and Firebase holds the potential songs to choose from and how many votes they have. Our iOS app is made in Swift4 using XCode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Spotify API was challenging to set up on iOS until we found a better alternative to using it. It was also hard to account for slow connections when the current song is ending and nothing is coming on next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to set up and bring together so many different technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about threading in iOS and constraints to support multiple phone sizes. We also learned a lot about Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iQueue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a way to choose which playlist the host uses as well as querying songs by searching spotify.
