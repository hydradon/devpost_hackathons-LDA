                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by card-combat games like "Slay the Spire"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scene includes some basic interaction featuring a hand of cards that run a selection of more atomic commands (such as a card that performs 2 attacks and a defense)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was build by a four man team using the Unity game engine. Three members developed code and one art assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Architecting a combat system in 24 hours is no small task. Issues with compatibility between git and unity caused some issues with lost work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is in a decently finished presentable state. It lacks polish but oozes charm.
                </p>
