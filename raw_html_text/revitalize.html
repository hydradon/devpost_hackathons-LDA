                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our school, we have recycling garbage cans everywhere, but we had hard times to figure out what whether the waste we have is recyclable. One of our hobbies is DIYs, sometimes we make decorations out of the wastes, and we wanted to inform people about the different things they can create with the waste that they have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you don't know whether or not the waste is recyclable, enter the item on the search bar, and you will get an instant answer and if it is recyclable the site would take the user to the DIY pages of that recyclable category. For example, bottles are recyclable, it falls under the plastic category, the site would link the user to the plastic DIY sites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a static page with html, design it with css and created buttons using javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we have very minimal knowledge about html, css, javascript, we have a hard to code for the search box
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished making our website, it can do the basic features that we wanted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to code in html, css, and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Revitalize
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we have time, we would implement more features such as areas for users to upload their DIY ideas using wastes and we will try to implement a feature that detects if the brand of that product is recyclable to impede the detecting process.
