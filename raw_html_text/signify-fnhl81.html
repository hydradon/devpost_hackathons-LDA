                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the project came from observing the lack of support for people with disabilities. We choose to focus on bringing an equal footing for death and/or mute members of society. Small actions can go a long way!

                <p>
                    Signify:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Provide a fun and educational way to learn sign language and bring together different communities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        recognizes a subset of sign language through the phone camera and translates the gesture to a letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        translates a word into a set of hand gestures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore a dictionary that displays the ASL alphabet with a quiz feature, which allows a user to guess the gesture.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application is built using Microsoft Azure Custom vision and the newest Apple framework SwiftUI. Azure was used for training, testing multiple iterations of ML image processing. Given the short period of the event, it allowed achieving advanced ML techniques without extensive prior knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were struggling with internet access and creating a live video feed for the phone camera. Azure definitely removed some of the heavy lifting in our workload.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an app with the feature that isn't available on app stores. It is nice to know that it could potentially help a lot of people when we continue to work on our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been learning about many new features of mobile development as data science.
                </p>

                    What's next for Signify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are gonna try to involve more students and make the application opensource so the programming community can help it turn it into something bigger.
