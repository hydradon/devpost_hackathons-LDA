                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reading various computer science research papers, I came across the concept of steganographic images and their ability to hide information in plain sight. I thought that it was a fantastic concept, so I was driven to develop a program of my own to implement it. There are times when I feel that sending emails or messages over the internet is not very secure, and LockPic is an attempt to remedy that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LockPic will take text or an image and hide it within another image given that the image is large enough. The image that stores the text or image will have virtually no perceivable difference in coloration to the human eye, and the text or image that was hidden away can only be retrieved by LockPic itself. This allows one to hide a message or image away into another image, with little to no way to tell that the image is hiding any information at all. It is perfect for sending confidential messages discretely or to hide sensitive documents
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LockPic was made with c++ and the CImg library, a fantastic open source toolkit for image processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary challenge that I ran into was determining the amount of image quality trade-off that would be acceptable for common use when storing an image within an image.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am most proud of learning the CImg library sufficiently enough to finish this project within the deadline. However much of this accomplishment was a result of CImg's extensive documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project heavily reinforced my bit manipulation ability and I learned a good amount on image processing.

                    What's next for LockPic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cleaner image storage, quicker execution, and harder-to-break storage of information
