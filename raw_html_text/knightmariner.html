                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created for HackUTD with the "weeb hack" category in mind, Knightmariner was created as a way to incorporate Code Geass' iconic Knightmare Frames into a traditional shooter game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knightmariner is a multiplayer shooter game which up to eight people can play at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Blender to make the models and Unity as the game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially the game was supposed to be a virtual reality game; however, we soon realized that the oculus rift technology wasn't compatible with laptops and required a desktop computer.  From there we decided instead just to make it a PC game.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments We're Proud Of

                    <li>
                        Knightmare Frame Animation

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, Knightmariner was a tremendous accomplishment for us.  From the beginning, we realized our project was ambitious and consistently doubted whether or not we'd even be able to get close to finishing.  HackUTD was a wonderful opportunity for us to test ourselves and really determine what we were capable of.  The majority of our group had never even used Unity or Blender before working on Knightmariner, so we genuinely surprised ourselves with the progress we made in the past 24 hours.
