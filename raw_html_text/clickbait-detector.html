                <p>
                    It's a web application (backed by Azure) that tells you how much a title is clickbait, giving it a score from 0 to 100 (and sometimes higher!). Titles from Buzzfeed receive higher clickbait scores, and titles from actual news sites (CNN, PBS, etc.) will receive low clickbait scores.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first collected hundreds of sample titles from Buzzfeed (considered clickbait) and other news sites (CNN, PBS, ABC, Fox, etc, not considered clickbait). Then, I came up with and generated values for a variety of heuristics, such as "does it begin with a number?", "does it include a word in ALLCAPS?", "how many words are in the title?" for each title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then plugged the data into Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning platform and ran a regression on predicting clickbait-ness based on the heuristics. With some trial and error, I found a Boosted Decision Tree to be the best regression type for predicting clickbait, giving a mean error of ~23% in predicting the training data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trained model was then deployed to Azure's web application platform, which generated an API for querying the model. I wrote a PHP middleman for abstracting away API access (and secret keys), and then a HTML/JavaScript frontend for making requests to the PHP script.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering article titles was difficult because few news sites have official APIs for pulling down their news article titles. Some titles were simply copied and pasted one by one. I was able to strip elements from some webpages so I could copy lists of titles at a time, which made data collection much faster. My training data included almost 1000 titles in total, and is available on GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming up with effective heuristics also took some work. I used some online word analysis tools to find the most commonly used words and make that a heuristic. Some clickbait titles could "look" like legitimate news. Having many heuristics enabled Azure to build an effective decision tree that could handle the tougher cases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It actually works! Most titles ripped right from Buzzfeed will score highly in clickbait scores, while other news pieces from other news sites will score low.

                <p>
                    The dream is to build an API and browser extensions that automatically block out clickbait titles while browsing the web.
