                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from nothing. I wanted to learn 3D graphics, and eventually learn VR, Unfortunately i wasn't able to obtain any gear, but I was able to make a really cool game.
                </p>

                    This is a

                        <em>
                            really
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    rough version of what I would like to be, but has all of the basics that I learned in there. It is a 3Dimentional space that utilizes the space for the paddle.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with C# in Unity3D. With the occasional 8 crashes overnight...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges that include syntax error, just barely the incorrect logic, the web not having the right answers, and many useful mentors that left at 10pm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel accomplished that I was able to finish this project at all. I knew that I was going to be able to finish it and feel proud about myself doing it. I was constantly going to mentors asking for help for my problems to get solved besides staying stuck, and watching youtube for excessive hours..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned C# which is very similar to Java, also learned how to use the Unity api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Pong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is next is what else I learn to do in Unity. For example, when I learn the Api for VR, i will do movement with the paddle with how you face. Or ray casting or something for the mouse movement instead of the arrow / wasd keys.
