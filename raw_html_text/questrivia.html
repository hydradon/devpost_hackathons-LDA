                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired when we went to an escape room over the summer and thought it would be fun if we created an online version that offered the same experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simulation of built-in quests and a "make your own" quest. It asks the user questions and lets them respond.
