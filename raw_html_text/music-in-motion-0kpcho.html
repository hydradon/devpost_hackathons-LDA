                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing an instrument is cool; playing an
                    <em>
                        invisible
                    </em>
                    instrument is even cooler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play an instrument with the power of the Leap Motion: Use your hands to play an invisible piano. It also doubles as a soundboard. An octave of a piano is displayed onscreen, along with the current position of the user's fingertips. When a user moves their fingertip close enough to the sensor, it plays the note they hovered over. Press M to switch to Daft Punk mode!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experimented with the Leap Motion API to pull data from the sensor for individual fingertips. Our program was constructed in Java, with graphics rendered using the Java Swing framework. We render a two-dimensional piano on-screen, with circles that represent the current position of a user's fingertips.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Leap Motion API was a challenging experience. The tracking of the Leap Motion, while precise, cannot comprehend complex finger patterns that are required for playing a real piano. And the program crashes for unknown reasons when initally bringing a hand into view of the camera, but only sometimes.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a functioning piano, and a really cool Daft Punk soundboard! We're especially proud of the Daft Punk soundboard feature since waves ripple the user's fingertips and the keys glow neon colors when pressed.

                    Future iterations could include new instruments and more sound fonts for the soundboard.
