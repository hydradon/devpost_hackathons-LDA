                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the current problems facing recipe websites - if you look for a steak recipe, sometimes the comments suggest edits that end up being even more popular than the original itself. We want to use a tree structure to document the meaningful variations / evolution of recipes, and realized we could apply this technology to other problems as well.

                    For example, when authors write stories, their progression of ideas is anything but linear. This infrastructure allows authors to more easily revisit older ideas and have any number of new ideas branch off.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores data in a node-like format. Each node can have any number of children that stems from it, in a "branch" like way.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Express framework to develop a RESTful api that services our frontend and talks to Firebase on the backend.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to use Firebase and Express, so this took a good chunk of time.
