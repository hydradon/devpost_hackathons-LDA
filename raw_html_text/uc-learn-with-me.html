                    Sometimes it is hard to make friends and form a study group in your courses - especially as transfers or first years.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We wanted to create a platform for students to easily connect with each other so that they could form study groups.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Using php, javascript, html5, and css, we developed a website for students to register for and access to find students in similar courses.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It was Irene's, James', and my first experience with javascript, css, and html5. James and Irene worked on the backend in Javascript which they learned only recently. Although it was definitely a challenge learning a new languages on the spot, we all picked up something new. Karan and I also had to build up on frontend which was not his or my strength. Karan also had to connect javascript and php to mysql. This was a great learning experience.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Irene and James are proud that they designed a successful search algorithm to scan for CRNs in an html file. They are also proud of their implementation of file upload. Karan and I feel accomplished in learning more about frontend.

                <h2>
                    Although we did not get a chance to implement all the ideas that we had, we will finish what we started throughout the next few months.
