                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beginner's story: Coming to Hack Duke, I really didn't have any experience coding. So, this project is simply a walkthrough project that an instructor here at Hack Duke walked us through that uses google api in our web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an alert timer where if a person is in danger, they could type in a phone number and start a timer,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using visual studio code, we created three files: a css, html, and javascript file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to the syntax was quite an obstacle. Over the seven hours we worked on this, I began to understand javascript and my fascination grew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I came to Hack Duke and learned a new skill set. Now, I have a lot of ideas that I want to create. For example, I want to create a web app that utilizes the google and twitter api to create a live stream hotspot map for natural disasters all around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to code in javascript and some other languages as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for TroubleTimer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll probably not further my TroubleTimer project, but I have other projects/ventures that I would like to
