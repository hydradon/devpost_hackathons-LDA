                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have made twitch bots in the past, and I really had this idea to make a better chat client for streamers because for awhile a client called Chatty wasn't being updated, which was saddening for me because I enjoyed using it. Luckily it has been worked on again, but I still felt inspired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects to a Twitch chat client, reads and displays messages while also allowing you to post it.
Currently you can customize the font, text color and size, etc in a menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a framework called Electron by Github, it combines the environments of node.js with a multi platform web environment and allows for easy making of desktop apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, and too many goals to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to get it working, I added far more customization options than I initially anticipated, and was super hype to get a lot of different features working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about calling different APIs (Twitch's APIs are used to get badge and emote images), I learned more about some CSS properties and changing them with JS, and a bit about CSS injection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chat Client
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More customization options, better cheering support, plugin support (Better Twitch Tv and FrankerFaceZ), and a better overall UI design.
                </p>
