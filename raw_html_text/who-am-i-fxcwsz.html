                    ##What was my Inspiration?
Since a long time I have been obsessed with riddles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    when invoked it gives the user ten riddles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    how I made it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Alexa developer console for the client side and used amazon web service lambda function for backend
 backend script is written in javascript node.js and uses Alexa-SDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a tough time making it in javascript since I am relatively new to it, and APL was a major hurdle since it is relatively new and there were not many detailed tutorials for it for it . And I had I tough time figuring it out. The tutorials from Twitch were really helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    my skill is voice-first multimodal and so its supported across all the Alexa hubs,  echo devices and tv,'s
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first experience making a Skill for a voice assistant and I am looking forward to learning more about it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for who am i
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will add more Riddles and sound effects and probably a few buttons to it
                </p>
