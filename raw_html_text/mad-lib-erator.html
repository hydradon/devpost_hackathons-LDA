                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you remember all your childhood memories, now tucked away in dusty boxes in your attic? And, perhaps, inside one of those boxes are stacks of Mad Libs, completed with friends and family during long car rides and rainy afternoons. Mad Libs, a classic American word game invented in the 50s, consists of one player prompting the other player(s) for random words that complete the sentences, resulting in a nonsensical story. Throughout the years, there have been at least thirty different themed versions, reinstating their mark on American culture with each release. However, what if the user could determine the theme of the story rather than the story determining the topic? Our team explored this possibility of rebooting the American classic with a new, modern approach.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Mad-Liberator helps despairing Mad-Libbers by prompting the user to input parts of speech and a keyword to serve as a 'theme'. The Bing web search API uses the &lsquo;theme&rsquo; to extract text from the first ten search results on Bing. Using this as source text, and the Linguistics API for part-of-speech recognition, the Mad-Liberator randomly selects words that match the part(s) of speech the user asked for.

                <p>
                    The Mad-Liberator was programmed in Python and implemented the Microsoft Bing web search and Microsoft Linguistics APIs.
