                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve ZEISS' ability to ensure zero defect photomasks and thus the chips that improve our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, there is a training phase with only image labels (vision/train...).
Thereafter, the very small model is used to segment new images. An inference script infers more attributes from the segmentation masks (whether the object lies on the edge, orientation, size).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our combined passion and skills ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exploring off-the shelve image analysis functions took some time until we settled with the final training regime.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weakly supervised training on only about 70 images.
1 1/2 minute training time.
                </p>

                        10 Mega Pixel per second inference on GPU.
Solid Dashboard that is setup to work with many machines.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed, developed and tested a new form of weakly supervised loss that works well for turning image labels into accurate binary segmentations.

                    What's next for Apollo PhotoMask Rescue: Defect Detection + Dashboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This setup is ideal to continually learn with easy to label data. On top of that, predictive maintenance tasks become feasible because it tracks performance over time.
