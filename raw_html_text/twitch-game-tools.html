                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being avid members of the gaming and live streaming community, we were greatly intrigued when we learned that Standard Library's Autocode beta had Twitch integration. We thought of the potential of building tools for game developers to create games that involve both the streamers and the spectators, bringing everybody together in one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch Game Tools is a proof of concept Twitch Chat command query API built in Node.js and Autocode. It is built to allow game developers to easily implement a tool that will connect twitch streamers to their audience through the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Autocode to handle commands and queries, the Twitch API to handle messages and commands, and Node.js and Phaser 3 to create the back end and demo game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No twitch chat support through Autocode
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficulty with integrating all components of the project

                        Learning Http requests in JS

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing the game and having a fully functional prototype. We are also proud of our versatility and productivity in our teamwork, allowing us to all work on the project at once and create a fairly polished final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned the functionality behind Autocode, as well as how to deploy and create APIs using it. We also learned how to integrate the Twitch API into different projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitch Game Tools
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assuming a wider breadth of commands slowly being integrated into the new Autocode ecosystem, we hope to move all of the twitch chat interactions into Autocode, allowing us to quickly prototype and deliver a full API that provides all the tools we wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also hope to implement Google Cloud Natural Language Processing to make interactions with the game more natural and seamless, rather than commands.
                </p>
