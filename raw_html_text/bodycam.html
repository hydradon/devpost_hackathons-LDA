                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our curiosity about hardware and spyware.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website streams footage from a (hypothetically) hidden camera.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a webpage using html and css, and then we hooked up a camera to the computer.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our major challenge throughout the creation of this project was how to insert the video. The rest was fairly simple, just code a functioning website for the footage to play in.  We originally wanted to use a wireless system for the camera, but we didn't have the resources for that. We tried hooking up the camera with an Arduino and then a Raspberry Pi, but both had unforeseen issues that made it impossible with the tech we had. Eventually we ended up just connecting the camera straight to the computer for demo purposes.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we managed to persevere in the camera department after experiencing what we thought was sure failure; none of the hardware we borrowed was working and didn't seem to be compatible with the computer. We pulled through this, problem solved, and got the camera connected in an entirely new way.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a technical standpoint, we learned how to operate hardware incorporated with software. We also learned that sometimes you have to completely re-think the problem before coming up with a solution. We received a lot of great help from the mentors and the helpers at the hardware table, and as a result we know a lot more about hardware than we did before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BodyCam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to connect through SSH using a Raspberry Pi in the future to allow the camera to be remote controlled. This is possible, we just didn't know to bring the monitor and keyboard needed for the Raspberry Pi. We also hope to expand the website and make it more simple and user friendly.
