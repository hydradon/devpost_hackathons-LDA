                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop an innovative way to learn new languages. Our solution, conVRsation, combines the joy of learning a new language with an enticing VR environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program works by using a Google Cardboard or other hardware to view our virtual reality simulation. When you enter the VR simulation, you can answer language questions by looking at boxes that reveal the answer!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our program using Unity. Our script for the Virtual Reality environment was written in C#. We also used Google Cardboard our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of this project was learning how to use Unity. It was the first time any of us have used any form of Virtual Reality development software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to learn how to use the fundamentals of Unity to create our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into tons of bumps and problems along these past three days, but ultimately learned more than we could have imagined. From coding in Unity and working with VR to cup stacking and meeting new friends, HTN has been an amazing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ConVRsation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to keep building on ConVRsation to make it more user friendly. But more importantly, we hope to keep honing our VR coding skills to build even bigger, better, and more impactful apps in the future!
