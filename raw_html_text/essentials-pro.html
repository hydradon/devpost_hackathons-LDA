                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make an app that has a large customer base on Alexa devices, and with the growing interest of essential oils this seemed like a great opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask the application what uses of commonly used essential oils.  It responds with the uses and then suggests another oil to search for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the recipe template provided by amazon, making changes as necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had issues with making the recommended next oil to make sure it does not recommend the same oil twice in a row.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    What's next for Essentials Pro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have already created a quiz app people can take to test their knowledge in the area.  Next would be go back to the drawing board and rework this original app to be more what the people want.
