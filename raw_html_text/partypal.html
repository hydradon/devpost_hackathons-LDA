                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea that parties can be anxiety inducing, and that this would significantly reduce stress
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    partypal Takes in a series of commands and does certain things based off them. You can call for help, alert the host of the party, and start a party session that periodically checks in on you to see how you are doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are implementing an app using react native, and the rest of our stack is python and twilio to process the text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to thread our tasks to get things to run in parallel, its more efficient,
                    <em>
                        efficiency
                    </em>
                    is good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about react flask ngrok and development with twilio.

                <h2>
                    What's next for partypal
                </h2>

                    a full app to help combine numbers and parties and a corresponding webapp.
