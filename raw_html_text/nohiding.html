                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that there was no crowd information on campus. We decided to come up with a solution to solve that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Informs the user of the crowd density level at a particular study area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python scripts, opencv and pre-trained YOLOv2 Algorithm. This software was then made to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Raspberry Pi Camera module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble setting up the raspberry pi without a monitor and getting the basic pre-trained model up on opencv.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We somehow managed to pull through as a team :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer vision is not that straight forward, but it was fun to figure it out on such a short time notice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoHiding
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to use what we learn to apply CV techniques and AI techniques in our future projects.
