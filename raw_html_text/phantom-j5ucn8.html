                    We were inspired to create this project after one of our team members read an article on phantom limb pain and learned that it affected more than 70% of all amputees. After learning that there is no reliable solution for phantom limb pain, we decided to try and offer our solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses a Myo armband to take EMG data from the stump of an amputee and recreates the limb in virtual reality using a google cardboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we initialized the Myo armband to try and gather some data. We then used unity to display the virtual arms using the motion data from the Myo armband and used google cardboard to display this in virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time connecting the Myo armband to our android phone automatically and getting the virtual arms to mimic the movement of real arms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Myo armband to connect automatically to the android device, getting the program to correctly display on google cardboard, and having the virtual arms mimic the movement of real arms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use blender for animations. We also learned how difficult it is to create a product in Virtual Reality and how to use Unity program programs in Virtual Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phantom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using low-cost EMG sensors instead of the Myo Armband so that it is more easily accessible for those in need.
