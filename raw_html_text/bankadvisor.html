                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a professional I, I rarely have the time during the day to speak to my financial advisor at my bank. Most branches' opening times are prohibitive and so I don't get the financial advice I need. At the same time the bank loses the opportunity to sell me the product that suits me best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BankAdvisor is an AI capable of delivering the financial advice I need. It holds the bank's product portfolio as well general advice based on the current financial status. Using the client transactional data it can detect changes in the clients need for financial products and offer them proactively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a concept for now. Would be using the Postbank API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will run into problems: training/building an appropriate AI, NLP, where to get the sources for financial advice. This is not an easy task, but it has a lot of potential.

                    Let's make it happen. I am still looking for people to join me :)
