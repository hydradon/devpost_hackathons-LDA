                    In researching blockchain infrastructure for an undergraduate project at Rutgers, team member Ryan wanted to shift from theoretical knowledge to an actual application. He presented an idea to team members Lucas, Paul, Alexis, George, Urja for a way to reward artists for their work in an industry that is known for exploiting free labor as "exposure." The idea was revised to instead fund charities to have a greater social impact, and the idea for BlocKontribute was born.

                    In BlocKontribute, the members of the blockchain are randomly selected as through a sortition algorithm to verify the next block in the the chain. Unlike other blockchains, BlocKontribute's verifiiers become judges of pitches for charities, deciding which charity should be awarded cryptocurrency upon the verification of a new block. This allows users to contribute to charities without any investment on their end other than a small amount of time.
