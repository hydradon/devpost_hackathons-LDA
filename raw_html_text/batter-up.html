                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day there are up to 15 games in the MLB. It can be hard to keep track of each game and see the interesting players play throughout the league. Instead of manually having to check box scores for each game and switching the MLB.TV game, this chrome extension is an easy place to keep track of all the players you are interested in. You can check whether an interesting player is about to bat and click on the MLB.TV link to watch the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chrome extension checks our backend with a list of subscribed players. The server returns the batting order data and shows you where they are in the batting order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by building the server side code that would call the MLB API and format it to our specifications. We then designed the chrome extension to call our server side API to get the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are new to developing chrome extensions so doing this part is especially challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new things and having a MVP ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better understanding of how to use foreign APIs, and since some group members didn't have any prior knowledge on creating chrome extensions, it was valuable experience for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Batter Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add pitcher data to this as well. It seems to use a different part of the MLB API that we'd have to research before we'd be confident in submitting it.
