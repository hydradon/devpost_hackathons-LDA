                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is inspired by the MOSA internship search presentation, which displays statistics about the results of applying for internships.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program allows the user to just enter their information, and they would be able to see a list of positions they have applied or about to apply without the hassle of formatting a spreadsheet. Our program also allows the user to put in the status of each position so that charts would be automatically generated so that the user would know how many positions they have applied, how many offers or rejections they have received, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will use Java to implement our concept, and the user will be able to interact with it via Java Swing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was implementing the GUI. We could not figure out how to transfer data between two JPanels, which caused us a large amount of time that we did not expect. This leads to another challenge - time management.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to choose an idea to implement out of many excellent ideas for the project. Also, though the project is not finished on time, we worked hard to get as much done as possible, such as implementing the display of charts, part of the GUI, and methods that modify the user's input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that when we plan the timeline for a project, we have to take problems and challenges into account, meaning that we should dedicate some time for debugging and solving problems that we did not expect, or else we would not be able to finish the project on time.

                    What's next for Job Hunting Helper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for this project is to continue to figure out how to link two JPanels together and the GUI as a whole.
