                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brought a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino Pro Mini, and some other various hardware to the hackathon, which were a solution without a problem. We decided it would be interesting and funny to use them to build something which would react to politicians' tweets by angrily flailing around, thereby lightening up the tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot's Python script has a list of Twitter handles to which it will respond. When any of these users tweet, the bot will respond by reading it out loud and waving its arms around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot is built from a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino Pro Mini, two servo motors, and some cardboard and red plastic cups. The Raspberry Pi and Arduino communicate with each other over a USB serial connection. To avoid undervoltage on the Pi, the Arduino and thus the motors draw their power from a powered USB hub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Tweepy to handle the Twitter API calls, but the streaming module wasn't really well documented. It took a few hours of tinkering and reading StackOverflow before we were able to have the bot start reading tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a Raspberry Pi to read from Twitter using the API was the major accomplishment of this project. During our testing, we also created a Twitter account to check if the bot was working; this account is now a mass of irrelevant and humorous tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing a Raspberry Pi with Twitter and Arduino, and using Python in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Media Outrage Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot is fundamentally a script which listens for tweets and responds accordingly, and as such is fairly extensible. Because Tweepy can listen for both users and keywords, this bot could be spun off as a device to help companies monitor public discourse about them, as some kind of emergency alert system over social media (akin to Facebook), or more lightly as a toy or gadget which lights up or waves when a certain user tweets.
