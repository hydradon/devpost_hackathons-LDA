                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created this game because I really wanted to publish a game to the Android app store for the first time. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to upload and get it published today, but I hope on doing so in the near future. I am glad to have had the opportunity to create my first fully-functional, fun Android game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jumpy Jeb is a game with only one objective: jump, forever. Or, at least, for as long as you can. You must control Jeb and help him make it through an endless series of monsters and obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Jumpy Jeb using the Unity Editor, which uses C# for its scripts. From there, I was able to build it to .apk format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the creation of this game, I faced frustrating challenge over frustrating challenge. Whether it was something simple as how to fade between two colors in a length of text, or something as complex as how to continually produce randomly generated platforms and monsters, each challenge lent me some knowledge I didn't have prior to this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have made this entire application on my own. There were moments where I was glued to my seat because I wanted to solve a certain problem, and there were also moments where I just wanted to close my laptop and be done with this. I am glad that I was able to see this project through to the finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the true power of Google during this project. Everything question you can imagine has already been posted with answers online. No matter what feature I wanted to implement or problem I needed to solve, nothing was beyond a search away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jumpy Jeb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on making improvements to the design of Jumpy Jeb and to integrate audio and sound effects. Also, before I publish this game to the app store I would like to build a level-based 'Campaign Mode.'
