                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were motivated by the need for wanting to be able to see past flights taken and be able to have easy access to their points earned, miles traveled and frequently visited places. Our primary inspiration was also trying to come up with a visual experience for users to relive their travels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application is designed based on the current American Airlines mobile app, with an extra feature of "Past Flights". This feature allows you to be able to see a year worth of flight history, miles, points earned and a video recap of places they journeyed to. The video recap starts off with a time-lapse showcasing different places and cultures around the world followed by symbolic pictures of your traveled to places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with React.js trying to connect it to what we were trying to accomplish. The API we were given did not have the data for Users' flight history and information that we needed. Hence, we shifted to a more UI based approach to mimic our potential design and plan. We also had some issues with scaling the website to different sized screens. Another challenge we ran into half an hour before the submission was some of our Github branches didn't merge correctly and resulted in lost data and disarrayed design. We were able to get a previous version working and fix this issue in time.
                </p>
