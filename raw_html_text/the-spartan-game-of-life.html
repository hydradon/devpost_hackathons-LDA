                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Peter H. Fr&ouml;hlich. In his Computer System Fundamentals class one "extra credit" item is to create the game of life in 6502 assembly, which I did, however the program ran extremely slow albait that program is ran on an online simulator written in javascript. As an EE learning about FPGA, I realized that it is very feasable to create the game of life efficiently using FPGA, and so I did.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    8 x 8 Toridal Conway's Game of Life displayed in an LED matrix. A button can cycle through eight different initial patterns.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an FPGA prototyping board called Mercury. The IO pins are connected to an LED matrix. By writing the VHDL code for the Spartan 3A FPGA chip I was able to design the logic driving the matrix.

                <p>
                    A buffer is created and updated per Game of Life rules one clock edge, and the data of the buffer is sampled a column at a time selected by a counter which also is the multiplexing driver for the display.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timing is crucial in FPGA because of the concurrency nature. Designing the system from scratch requres a lot of attention to details.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    IT WORKS!!!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patience is important, and always make simulations before implementing on hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Spartan Game of Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some design of the logic that could be made more efficient. Maybe an option to generate a random initial condition can be added.
