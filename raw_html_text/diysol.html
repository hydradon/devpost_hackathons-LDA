                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solarmove is a Swiss based startup working to promote access to solar energy by lowering the cost of PV installations by promoting self construction. Sumthesun is a Kosovo based startup whose objective is to offer people interested in solar energy a platform and a costumer friendly calculator that can compare different products and services. The collaboration born in Berlin builds on both ideas and focuses on offering access to large information regarding PV materials and services, promoting ownership and a DIY approach in the choice of the installation

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed a centralized market place that allows clients to choose from different solar products (panels and Inverters) in a transparent way. We have developed a calculator that informs clients about the different products available to build a PV installation, and plan to expand our calculator with more features in the future.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gathered data on prices and materials from Swiss wholesalers and built an interactive database where clients can choose the PV installation according to their needs based on brands, prices, colors.

                <p>
                    We will need to access a great amount of data to offer this services to different markets worldwide. Time management was also an issue.
