                    Are you tired of sorting through your business card collection? Can't remember whose card is whose? With FaceQR, just take a selfie with your business contacts and you'll have their website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With FaceQR, every face can be associated with a unique URL.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Register your FaceQR

                <p>
                    To register your URL, just click "Register your face", where you can take a selfie with your webcam. Enter your URL and you're done - anyone can now use your face as a FaceQR code!
                </p>

                    Look up a FaceQR
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Simply navigate to "Look up a face" and upload a photo of your contact's face. If they have registered a FaceQR, their personal URL will be displayed!
