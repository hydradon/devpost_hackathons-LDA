                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone loves food, but it's not always easy to make or cheap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it is very unfinished and does not have all the features we wanted, it would be like a social media to shopping in bulk, group cooking and shared ingredients, even potlucks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to learn react native all on the spot and code the apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had too much software development experience, so getting the server to work, and app to look even basic was tough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not giving up on the project no matter how hard we thought it was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software development, react-native, group working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cookee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get it fully functional.
                </p>
