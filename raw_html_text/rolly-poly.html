                    We (Makena, Ivy, and Alyssa) really just wanted to learn how to use unity to create a VR game. Our biggest struggle was getting our game to be compatible with the Samsung note 7 so that we can use a Gear VR headset! Ultimately, we hope to have the user flap his/her arms so that she can control the ball through an accelerometer attached to a hardware that she holds while playing Rolly Poly. Also we weren't able to accomplish this by the deadline, but we want to make the ground a sphere that the player is gravitationally attached to. This game with continued development has both fun, and educational applications.

                    My team and I are beginners and had so much fun learning some C# and the power of unity! We still have lots to learn and grow with this project, and we can't wait to see what games come out of our, currently, very elementary game
