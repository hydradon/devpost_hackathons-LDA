                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the work of plantvillage.psu.edu and iita.org, we wanted to build an Arduino-based autonomous robot that can move in a farm environment without damaging existing plants or soil and use object detection to find crops and categorize them as diseased or healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a disease detection robot that autonomously moves around farms and reports the location of diseased plants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Smart Bot 3.0 kit, raspberry-pi for image streaming. The network camera is connected to the raspberry-pi, which in turn is connected to a mobile hotspot. The laptop is connected to the same hotspot. This allows for the network camera to stream to the computer. Then, we run the stream through a convolutional neural network based on mobilenet SSD (built on TensorFlow) and do the plant classification and identification in real-time. Then, we transmitted the stream through a network port to a Wix website through a desktop encoder (OBS).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuous live streaming from the raspberry-pi on to a Wix website was difficult at first. However, we were able to look at some of the in-depth documentation and figure out how to stream it through an encoder. Earlier, we tried using Google Vision and Video Intelligence API. However, due to network connectivity issues (as a lot of students were on the network at the venue), the program would crash. Eventually, we ended up replacing it with a pre-trained neural network from GitHub. We also wanted to map a crop field in a matrix. Changing the matrix representation dynamically and then adding it to the Wix platform was challenging too, especially since we got to that part later during the project.
                </p>

                    Some parts of the control and code will be used for the full version of Farmaid. If this prototype is successful, a larger robot can be designed for autonomous disease detection.
