                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were driving home from Mango Hacks and our car died in the middle of nowhere. All we needed was someone to stop for us to give us a jump start but sadly no one did so we were stuck there for hours. But in our dread rose another man's blessing, what could we do to ease the struggle of others in our situation?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine your on the side of the road, you got a flat, no idea how to fix and no one you know nearby. With the simple push of a button, you have now informed many kind individuals of your struggle and they're willing to help. The nearest "buddies" with the app will be notified of the situation and can accept to help another out or not. No fees just connecting people for the betterment of a society.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java,Android Studio,XML and use of the Firebase database.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing is easy but this particular build was a struggle to behold.From the beginning with just setting up Android Studio we had a hard time. But as the hours went by and more problems arose we handled them all the best we could.Setting up the FireBase, Pinpointing Location and getting the most important part the notifications across multiple devices to show up.

                <p>
                    Every moment through this journey were we learned something new is something to be proud of. But we can pin point one very important accomplishment as getting and showing location.
