                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project Green Visuals was inspired to track the usage of consumption of various products and energy in order to reach the goals of limiting and ultimately relying only on renewable and self-sustainable resources in Hawai'i.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application, based on user's input, will generate a predicted amount that the user will consume of each type of energy of continuously consuming the same amount, daily. Alongside of which are tips to reduce consumption of products and energy to reach the goal of sustainable living.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a bootstrap template to create the web application, and used D3 to create graphs which reflect data.
