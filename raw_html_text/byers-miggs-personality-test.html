                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a recent trend where Instagram users use facial recognition to find out randomly associated attributes. We decided to do something similar by porting this functionality to the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a photo of the user's face and tries to extract meaningful data from the image. Examples of this data include age, gender and facial expression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Gatsby framework. For facial recognition, we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js" rel="nofollow">
                        face-api.js
                    </a>
                    for local near-instantaneous recognition to ensure the existence of a face in the image before capture. The screenshot is then sent to Azure&rsquo;s Cognitive Vision Services to get higher-quality facial data. Our app then analyses the data retrieved to compute your personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time trying to use
                    <code>
                        face-api.js
                    </code>
                    library to detect the presence of a face before taking the screenshot. The API was somewhat confusing and it was also our team&rsquo;s first time working with such facial recognition libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also faced difficulties sending image data to Azure cognitive services. The API documentation was lacklustre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to our designer's efforts, our web application has a clean user interface and is rather simple to use. A user is able to take the personality test without much effort. A single click is all they need to find out their personality.
                </p>

                    What's next for Byers-Miggs Personality Test
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to create more personality spectrums and possibly include audio analysis for increased accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a fun experience building a parody of a famous personality test.
