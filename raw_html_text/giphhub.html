                    GiphHub is a program that uses Giphy API, Indico API, &amp; node.js to choose and place relevant gifs onto individual powerpoint slides.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was "pivoting" (changing our mind on what idea would be our project) three times before we finally picked GiphHub.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GiphHub team is proud of these two compliments the most: Our team and our program. Only two members of this team knew each other beforehand, besides them, no one knew each other. It is incredible that we all found each other and created such a great group dynamic in a short time. 
We put our best effort forward on this program and it is safe to say that we are extremely proud of our program's capabilities.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of teamwork and communication, as well as giving tasks to each team member that would most efficiently utilize their best skill.

                    Even the sky isn't the limit when it comes to programming, so who knows! We have a lot of options.
