                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea during the team-building session at the beginning of the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects employers with potential candidates for job positions. Applicants create their professional portfolio and employers can quickly review each portfolio and either "like" it or "nope" it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Information for applicants and employers was stored in an SQL database. We used the Flask framework for Python to write the server-side and for the client we used HTML, CSS and javascript, integrating Twitter's Bootstrap library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with some server connection issues. Having two different types of users (employer/applicant) also caused us some problems. eHireMe is meant to create an interaction between employers and applicants, but connecting the two created some difficulty. We also had some issues saving the user's state over the different web-pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our teamwork despite meeting for the first time during the event and being from different schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to transfer PDF files to a server and display them on a web-page.
