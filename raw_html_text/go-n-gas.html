                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always forget to get gas when I'm going on a trip, but am a broke college student. Considering I'm glued to my phone, all I need to do is text this bot, and it'll give me a link to google maps with the gps ready to stop at a cheap gas station on the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text our twilio number with:
go (start address) (end address)
Twilio responds with a google maps link for your route, with the cheapest (and closest) gas station already planned on your route, ready for your gps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used twilio to recognize and store message data. Use google directions and google places api to check a radius around you for gas stations every leg (turn) on your route. Use beautiful-soup/selenium to run the address of each nearby gas station through a crowd sourced website for recent gas prices. Return a new google maps route with the gas station included
Twilio takes this route link, and sends it back to the user to use for gps on their phone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using csv file to store individualized data with twilio
Data mining a dynamic website using beautifulsoup is difficult
Time constraint: must be exact address with proper format, unable to implement our other goals of sending your gps location (iphone) and sending a google maps link with your route already planned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a from scratch project with APIs we never used before
Getting correct results for hand read inputs
The entire back end of it works when we hand feed data, but unfortunately the current version as of 11:50AM doesn't run because of issues with transferring data from twilio to a csv file and reading that file concurrently
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us used these APIs before, so now we're more confident in trying out new things.
                </p>

                    What's next for Go 'N Gas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently we're running on a trial run of twilio and can't support much volume; we'll try to make it easily usable for multiple people at the same time
We also want to add sending your gps location (iphone) and sending a google maps link with your route.
Further, we'd like to make this implementable in the google maps app
                </p>

                    How to use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text 1-251-9502 go start_address end_address
Receive a google maps link back in seconds
As of right now the twilio input doesn't work
