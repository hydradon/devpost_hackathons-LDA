                    So all of us are transfer students in some way. And we've all had to go through the process of seeing whether our courses would transfer. Also, since college is so expensive nowadays, one has to worry about how one can complete their degree at the cheapest cost possible.

                    This website asks a user for what is the course at their school they'd like to take, but at another school. Then it returns a list of schools which have directly equivalent courses and lets the user know how much it'll cost to take the equivalent course at another school versus their own school
