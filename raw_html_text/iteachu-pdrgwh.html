                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application makes it easier for children to study at home. Because children like to play games, we thought that making an application that is an educational and fun would allow children or younger students to learn more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows teachers to post questions and their corresponding answers. Students then answers them and get a score based upon how long it takes for the students to correctly answer the questions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaFX  within the Eclipse IDE to build this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally wanted to code the app in Python but, not every team member could get Pygame to work on their computers. We then attempted to do our project in Java and was able to complete it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of coding techniques from each other, and we are proud that we were able to finish our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to install Python on our computers as well as different ways to approach the coding process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ITeachU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more options to the app such as, a login for teachers, a ListView for teacher to be able to edit their list of questions. Also we would like to make the game adding obstacles for the student to overcome before they can answer a question.
