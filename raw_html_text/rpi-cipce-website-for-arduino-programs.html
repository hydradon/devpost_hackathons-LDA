                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current website for CIPCE, a pre-college education program at RPI, is rather old and outdated.  Also there's no dedicated website for the Arduino program that I've been involved with, so I wanted to make a website that could be used to help promote the program as well as a provide a central location for all of the materials and educational documents that we make.  I also never made a website before, so I wanted to try something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that shows information on the programs as well as a possibility for a wiki like learning center on Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded it on my laptop using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit of Jquery
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfamiliar with anything web related so didn't know some boilerplate requirements as well as figuring out how to position things properly on a page.  Also couldn't get Javascript to work properly for awhile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made a website that has the potential to be used in pre-college education programs.  It's surprisingly better put together than expected and I feel proud of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a website as well as how to consider designing pages for usability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RPI CIPCE Website for Arduino Programs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more functionality to website (full wiki functionality) and improving the ui/design of website
                </p>
