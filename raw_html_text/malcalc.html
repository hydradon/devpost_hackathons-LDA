                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew that I wanted to experiment with an android app, but I couldn't come up with an idea. I was chatting with my friend when he made a joke about me writing a broken calculator. I took off with the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The calculator is an android app that accepts the user's input and evaluates the input, then returns that evaluation + 1.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used android studio. I installed it for the first time yesterday, and spent the first hour or so just getting it installed and up to date. I then began by crafting the UI through a combination of buttons and read-only text fields, then I linked the buttons to the operations I needed them to perform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm I came up with for this calculator relied on the program being able to parse through a string that was constructed by the user's inputs and then submitted to the program with the "=" button. The hard part was making sure that the calculator would follow order of operations even inside of different functions (e.g. log(4,6*4-1) -&gt; log base 4 of 6*4-1).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never worked with an android app before and I'm amazed at how well it turned out. I'm also proud that I was able to implement a program that read in a user's string and was able to reliably parse out the functions required and the operands used.

                <p>
                    The basics of using android studio.

                    What's next for MalCalc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I guess I could change the answer offset to 0 so that it is a legitimately useful tool, but it's MalCalc... it's got bad in the name! (Mal is Spanish for bad)
