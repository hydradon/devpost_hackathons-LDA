                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Tinder app has three main drawbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, why focus on someone's physical appearance when instead you can be less shallow and focus on their bio, to really get to know them as a person?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, the app is more of a solo activity - why not include your friends on your lovemaking decisions? We set out to fix these issues for Valentines Day 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, what if the user is vision impaired? Making Tinder accessible to this group of users was central to our goals of making Tinder the best it can be for all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Tinder lets you Tinder using voice commands, asking Tinder for details about the user, such as their bio, job title, and more. From there, you can choose to either swipe right or swipe left, with similar voice commands, and go through your whole Tinder card stack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Alexa API and Amazon Lambda functions to set up the Alexa environment, and then used Python to interact with the API. For the image descriptions, we used Clarifai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the Alexa API/Amazon Lambda functions was the main drawback as it had some funky quirks when being used with Python!
