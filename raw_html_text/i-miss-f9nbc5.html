                    Do your kids miss you when you're away? Of course, they do! Let them tell it to Alexa, and surprise them with your own voice!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Say "Alexa, open I miss. What is my unique id?" to gather your id for the mobile application. Download "I miss" mobile application from your Android device (iOS application is under construction):

                        https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasbis.android.imissmymom
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the acquired id for authentication (This is a one-time requirement unless you log out). 
Record&amp;and send your voice via "I Miss" mobile app (Requires internet connection). 
Let your kids say "Alexa, open I miss, I miss my mom/dad". And it will play whatever you have recorded for the little members of your family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try recording some comforting sentences, tell some stories, moreover​, make some surprises by hiding things and giving some clues. Your voice will always be with them, even if you are having a rough day at work.
