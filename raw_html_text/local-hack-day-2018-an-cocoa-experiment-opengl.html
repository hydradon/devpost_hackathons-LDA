                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a follow up to my Hack CU IV project; I really enjoyed doing it, but hated how laggy it was after a while, and wanted to test Cocoa to see if it wasn't as laggy. It isn't as laggy, and I'm super happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    100 "bubbles" spawn. With a cursor, you have to pop those bubbles by moving the cursor with the arrow keys (or WASD) and popping the bubbles with space (or enter). If you do, you're rewarded with a black screen! (And control of your desktop again...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XCode, Cocoa, and OpenGL; I used an OpenGL view on a window that was borderless and  had opacity turned off, and so the clear color was allowed to be a transparent color, which shows everything that's behind the window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never used Cocoa before, so writing everything in Objective-C++, wrapping OpenGL, and finding a replacement for every glut function that I've used like glutIdleFunction was difficult to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that this runs at a steady frame rate. I'm also proud that I was able to do this in less than 12 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (mostly) learned how to use Cocoa, and I learned how useful GLUT is to using OpenGL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Local Hack Day 2018 - An Cocoa Experiment (+OpenGL)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a proof of concept for something that could end up being really weird. This project probably won't be touched much, but many of the techniques I learned to get this working with Cocoa could be used for other weird projects.
