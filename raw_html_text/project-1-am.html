                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to bring Augmented Reality technologies to an unexpecting space; challenging ourselves to think outside of the box. We were looking for somewhere where user experience could be dramatically improved.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our AR mobile application recognizes DocuSigns QR codes and allows you to either sign up directly or generate an automated signature without ever leaving your phone.

                    We built it with our awesome brains and

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the given API and other back-end technologies to actually authenticate and submit the process. We ran into challenges when trying to integrate the digital world with the technical world. There was not much documentation online when it came to merging the two platforms. We also ran into challenges with image recognition of the QR code because AR depends on the environment and lighting.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a MVP out of the challenge, we did a lot of collaboration and brainstorming which sparked amazing ideas, we spoke to every sponsor to learn about their company and challenges
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API's with little documentation and trying to integrate with new technologies can be very challenging. Pay attention to details because it's the small details that will cost you hours of frustration. Through further research we learned about the legalities with digital signatures which sometimes can be a pain point for companies who use eSign like DocuSign.
