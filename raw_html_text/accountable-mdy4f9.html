                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to come up with a way to make corporations more accountable to their stakeholders and works towards accomplishing social goals that benefit stakeholders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a company to put data pertinent to a social goal onto the blockchain and have stakeholders/the public check if the company achieved the goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with solidity smart contracts and ReactJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble trying to come up with a way to keep the company data private. We thought about using enigma, but we decided not to mainly because we didn't know Rust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning solidity smart contracts and some ReactJS. We came in with virtually no practical knowledge of dapp development, and are leaving with new knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidity, ReactJS. Some of us never coded before and now know a little bit of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Accountable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might work on this idea in our free time. A lot of companies are interested in becoming more socially accountable, and so this idea is worth developing.
