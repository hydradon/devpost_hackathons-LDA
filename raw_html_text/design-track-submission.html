                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't like the design of Rice University's website when we applied as new students, so when we had the opportunity to change it, we wanted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The new residential colleges webpage displays the information for individual colleges as a rollover of the college's crest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We re-designed the residential colleges webpage using only html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the rollover without using javascript was difficult, especially in a horizontal direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website looks nice, is easy to use, and is informative. And the parallax scrolling is really cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to implement html and css to design a beautiful and functional webpage.
                </p>
