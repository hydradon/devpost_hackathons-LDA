                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app when Dylan shared his experiences visiting Mexico. He was notified of many attractions almost unknown to the locals-- avoiding crowded, sweaty tourist traps and drastically improving his visit. We decided that everyone should have a chance to know about the world's hidden gems, and thus WanderLost was born.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WanderLost allows users to submit a form online of a recent place they visited. Using this, it will add a marker on the google map of the homepage, alerting that an attraction has been placed

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The FrontEnd is built with basic HTML/CSS. The backend is done with flask, which provides database support with  sql-alchemy to avoid writing tedious SQL statements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest curves was learning flask, and creating the mysql-alchemy database that takes in data from the user's form requests. The biggest challenge was adding the markers in google maps based on the coordinates saved in the database.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootsrap. Overall, increasing our knowledge of developing web applications
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wanderlost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest step is to make sure markers are added to the main page when a new location is submitted. Additonally, most of the pages will likely be restyled using bootstrap. There will also be a search and rating button that will allow users to search different locations and read their reviews.
