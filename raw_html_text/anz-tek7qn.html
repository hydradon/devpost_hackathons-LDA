                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired me to build this webapp alongside my partner, Yuya, is how it appeared to me that people who travel from far distances find it hard to find someone to share a ride with to go to a destination. That is why we build this webapp, to help connect people to get from point A to point B without the hassle we once knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Match drivers who have extra seats and are seeking for passengers with passengers who are seeking carpool with a sense of credibility as both parties have contacted one another through a credible platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used non-code based service call Bubble.io which we discovered through a workshop in Cal Hacks 6.0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extra features that we have to pay. It is more than us buying domain and renting a server with this scale.
                </p>

                    What's next for AnZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a chatroom and better matching with drivers and passengers.
Present direction, duration, and distance.
Present average price for a certain trip after enough data is recovered.
