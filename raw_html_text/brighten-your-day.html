                    Am I happy? This is a question we all have wondered from time to time, and the truth is that few of us know the answer. With Brighten Your Day, the user can now keep track of his/her moods everyday, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding about their emotional well-being. Are you happy?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brighten Your Day allows the users to post their diaries every, then it will use IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API to analyze their emotions of that day, whether they are happy, sad or anger... Then the users will be able to track their moods history through our calendar, allowing them to view their emotional history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ajax call to the IBM Watson API took us a long time to debug the error. The syntax is complicated and error prone, luckily with the help of IBM people, we figured it out.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Brighten Your Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that there is a lot that we could add to Brighten Your Day. We planned to give the users suggestions on how to lead a happier life, such as "Help someone else today" after comparing the results of their personality insights. It could also be used to detect and prevent users' mental health illness.
