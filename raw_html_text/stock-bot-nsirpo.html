                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team consists of 3 engineers and one actuarial science major. None of the three engineers had previous knowledge of stocks or how to properly invest. Despite this our group still choose to develop a stock trading bot using technical analysis. It was really interesting learning about stocks and finance from the actuarial science major, and putting these newfound lessons into code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in open source stock data which was available online and transforms this data into trends where there are visible indicators showing if the market value is under or over valued which indicates when you should buy and sell the stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built everything using python which imports csv files of the stocks current and past values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphing the indicators of stock trends was difficult because of the weighted average of the last 14 days which caused problems for making it into a continuous array.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows the market trends and has the potential to inform investors on current market trends and good times to trade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group learned a lot about stocks, technical analysis, and indicators through our independent research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to continue to update the code with more indicators and have a more accurate weighted average of different indicators.
