                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using friendly competition is an excellent way to motivate people. We wanted to use this to encourage people to help the environment in whatever way they can, even if it is just in small ways.

                    This app allows you to make posts of something you've done to help the environment. You can also view other people's posts and rate how green you think they're being. The higher ratings you get, the more your own personal tree will grow.
