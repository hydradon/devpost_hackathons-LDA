                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the notices we've seen posted around our neighborhoods and the fact that we really needed an original idea for the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to post pins of items that they lost or found on Google Maps, in the hopes that someone who lost or found the item will see the item will see the post and reach out accordingly.  It's essentially a virtual lost item poster board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and Django to build this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us are web designers, so we still had a lot of trouble wrestling with the CSS and Django framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to turn out a decent looking website with our paltry web design skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have to each use different git branches when writing code, even if we're a small team. We lost a lot of time on merge conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for findmyprecious
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few features we want to add before making it public. A few features would be Twilio support, social media integration, attaching images to pins. We currently have image support in the pins, but are having trouble with the actual upload.
