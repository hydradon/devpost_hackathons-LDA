                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have data. We wanted to have fun with it.

                <p>
                    Our project asks you information about you apartment, and it uses a combination of different machine learning models to predict its price. Apartments in DC metropolitan area only.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used typeform to poll your apartment info, and then run it through a sklearn model trained on 800 datapoints gathered by Apartments.com (CoStar). Finally, we send the information through email to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the 20 or so models we tried, we found that decision-tree ensembles tended to work best. Specifically, Gradient-boosted trees were the best performers overall, and its superiority is consistent over different feature configurations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is hard. It took a while for us to figure out how we can best clean the data and train the models. Overfitting was a minor hurdle, and we also tried very hard to make sure that we're validating our models properly, without leaking testing data into the training set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with rigorous cross validation, our model is able to conistently explain 70% of the variation in our testing set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decision trees are awesome!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned to use (and abuse) Typeform, SkLearn, and machine learning for fun and profit.
                </p>

                    What's next for How much can I rent my apartment for?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thinking about expanding our data to the whole United States, and add more geolocation-based features; from what we found about the D.C. metropolitan area, adding GPS coordinates doesn't seem to improve the accuracy of the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, over wider spreads of data points, location might start to be a more important factor in price determination.
