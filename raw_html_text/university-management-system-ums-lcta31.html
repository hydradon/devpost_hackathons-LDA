                    <strong>
                        The inspiration to create this application came from two different issues students face in universities.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    1)     The difficulty of taking appointments with faculties and officials in the University. 
Students usually have to bombard professors or University officials with emails for an appointment to get their doubts clarified. This frustrates both the students and the staff alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2)  The difficulty in finding or filing academic documents. Upload Artifacts is a facility by which a student can upload all the academic-related documents which she/he has referred. Such documents normally include relevant pages of text-books referred, essays and short notes written during the course of study, reference materials of various kinds, etc. Such uploaded artifacts can be seen by administrators and they can approve the uploaded documents and delete if any of these documents are irrelevant to the studies. This facility will become a useful library in due course. A new student will be able to view the uploaded artifacts of those students who had studied the same course earlier. The faculties can suggest such repositories of knowledge by pointing out the uploaded materials of the outstanding students who had completed the courses earlier.

                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team consists of two graduate students who, from the daily struggles of requesting an appointment and also to find relevant academic documents, found out this solution in the form of a web application named UMS. While we were learning about Appian and its potential uses from the tutorials, we came to the realization that Appian would be the best tool for the two business solutions that all University students need. We started building the pages, components, interfaces, etc., by trial and error method. We learned a lot from the mistakes and shared the findings with each other. In less than two weeks we completed the application.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Faculty would be frustrated if they have to reject appointments just because it doesn&rsquo;t fall in the days and time of their availability. Hence the future version of UMS would include personalized calendar showing days and timings suitable for each faculty. If a student gets appointment at a particular timing on a particular day the same date and timing will not be available to any other students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With minimal changes, a future version of UMS can be developed which can function as an office communication system enabling communication and data exchanges among employees and management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future version would also leverage Appian&rsquo;s ability to upload videos. That would help faculty to upload relevant academic videos to the site which would enhance student&rsquo;s ability to learn more.
