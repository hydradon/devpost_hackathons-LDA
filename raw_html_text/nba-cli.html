                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app, because we have a pasion for basketball, and enjoy watching the NBA games. Our app allows us to get our information quickly and efficiently while displaying lots of information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ou app is a command line interface that returns the standings, boxscores, live scores and upcoming games in the nba.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using python with cmd and made our website with html
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found parsing to be a very difficult and tedious task but by making good use of for loops we were able to successfully parse the various strings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were actually able to finish a very big project at a hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code a command line interface. I(Kushaun) also learned Python which I had never coded in previously
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NBA CLI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our CLI to operate not just for the NBA but also for other sports leagues like the NFL, NHL, etc...
