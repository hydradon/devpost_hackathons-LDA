                        Originality
                    </strong>
                    To our knowledge, there are no other games in the market that simulate K-Pop idol survival shows. Our love and passion for K-Pop prompted us to design and develop a game that included it. Taking inspiration from other simulation video games, our game encompasses a range of several mini-games that interpret the typical process of a survival show into a short game. This might be the first time that anyone has created a game like this in a hackathon and we are satisfied with our idea and accomplishments.

                        Completeness
                    </strong>
                    Our original scope of the game encompassed more complex functionalities, however, due to time and quality constraints, we were unable to fully implement all of them. We included a simpler system of choosing the winners and created a smoother flow for the time allotted. Besides these changes in scope, we were able to fulfill our original purpose of creating a K-Pop survival game. The basic logistics of our features and narrative were done as planned and flowed smoothly. All in all, we are content with the work that we have done over the course of 2 days. We ran into several roadblocks in logic, resolved various complicated issues, became physically drained, but overall, still managed to persevere and produce a functional product.

                        Design
                    </strong>
                    For the final implementation of the project, we opted to use 8-bit artwork. Not only did it provide for simpler development and inclusion of assets, it also allowed the project to take a unique style of aesthetics. The colors also remained consistent throughout the project and portrayed an inviting and cool blue. Another design aspect that was purposefully included was a minimalist design throughout the game, which allows the users to easily digest the information within the page and enjoy the game to its fullest.
