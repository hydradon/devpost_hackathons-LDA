                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that could help save energy and electricity. Currently, many households waste electricity when they forget to turn off the light after leaving a room. We wanted to fix this problem and have an app that could potentially eliminate this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app creates a checklist of appliances per room in a household. Also, with a "smart" household system, appliances can turn off in a room when you or your family are not in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno to act as our "smart" household system. We used a PIR motion sensor to act as the appliances that could turn on or off based on if people are in a room. We also used Android Studio to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to figure out a way to connect the Arduino to the Android app via Bluetooth. We were not able to accomplish this due to a few pieces of hardware we were missing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that we learned a lot about hardware in 36 hours. All of us came into this not knowing much about hardware but now we can say that we understand more about how the Ardunio and PIR sensor work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ElectroList
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have time to figure out how to connect our Ardunio to the Android app we created so we would definitely like to implement that sometime in the future!
