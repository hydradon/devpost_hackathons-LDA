                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that helped people to be more environmentally conscious. After we thought about it, we realised that most people are not because they are too lazy to worry about recycling, turning off unused lights, or turning off a faucet when it's not in use. We figured that if people saw how much money they lose by being lazy, they might start to change their habits. We took this idea and added a full visualisation aspect of the app to make a complete budgeting app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to log in, and it then retrieves user data to visually represent the most interesting data from that user's financial history, as well as their utilities spending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as our front-end, and then used Arduino to get light sensor data, and Nessie to retrieve user financial data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To seamlessly integrate our multiple technologies, and to format our graphs in a way that is both informational and visually attractive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a finished product that does exactly what we wanted it to do and are proud to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about making graphs using JavaScript, as well as using Bootstrap in websites to create pleasing and mobile-friendly interfaces. We also learned about integrating hardware and software into one app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Budge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue to add more graphs and tables to provide more information about your bank account data, and use AI to make our app give personal recommendations catered to an individual's personal spending.
