                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything starts from a simple app that generates values based on your music. These values are changing while music plays, thus generating a cool and personalized picture for your incoming calls. Depending on your ringtone, the color mood is set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea has been lingering around for 4 years. At first, the idea was to create a simple visualizer that would generate something awesome to our screens, in conjunction with the music. Then followed the idea of making it into an app and find a profitable marketplace, where customers could purchase a ringtone, that corresponds with a specific video (different effects).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to make something cool, but as well cheap enough that customers around the world would purchase it. It goes without saying that everything should be available online. In addition, promotion could be done by the artists themselves (e.g. promoting new albums).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, as Spotify has all the necessary licences to promote and sell records, it came to our mind that our idea could be integrated with Spotify during Hackjunction.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regarding our organizational side, we decided to split our team into two groups:
back-end and design team. Back-end team worked on the webpage demo, while
the design team made some cool visualizations to show more what our idea is
about. Our workflow was all about trial and error as none of us had ever worked
with Android Studio nor developed an app for mobiles, so we had no idea of
what to expect. The same thing was with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest and only challenge we faced on the 2nd day, after our Android app
was already in the making, was that it was quite complex and some forums
even said it is impossible to replace the caller screen by another app. Over the
course of Hackjunction we learned that our initial simple idea was way harder to
execute and would take more time than we had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall we think we made a great job bringing our ideas to life. We have a great
webpage that is using the Spotify Web API to show what we have achieved.
Furthermore, there is also a video on YouTube to illustrate our idea and we
could not have been more happy to have taken on this challenge. We will still
continue to improve our app, because we think it is a great idea that has not yet
been realized by others.
PS. Most importantly, we realized how important it is to communicate and how
to work well as a team. And we think we did great!

                    As our server is having some problems, the project demo can be viewed in localhost.
