                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been inspired to create a bot that calculates which answer is the best answer because I'm tired of losing.  Plus, all the other public bots have been taken down (hopefully mine next).

                <p>
                    The application takes an image from HQ Trivia with the question and the three possible answers visible, and outputs the option that it most thinks is most likely the answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given an image from HQ Trivia, it extracts the question and three possible answers as Strings from the image using Google's Vision Platform.  Then, I use Google's CustomSearch API to search the question in a Google search, in which the top links (defined by user) from the search result are retrieved.  The application visits each link and parses through the HTML to find sequence of character matches using rollover hashing.  Every time a match is found, it increments a counter, and then the counters are printed out to show which possible answer came up with the most results.
