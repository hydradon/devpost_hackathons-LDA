                    We all know that entering the field can be daunting because many people struggle to breakthrough with innovative ideas, especially students.We created Bond Forward to mitigate some of these fears and connect young programmers with experts in the field. Mentorship is extremely important and essential to a career in computer science. Mentees from underrepresented minorities can also benefit from many aspects of this kind of a relationship due to the scarce amount of resources due to a variety of contributing factors. 
Our website allows Students to create a profile that highlights their talents by pulling information from the linkedin database. Mentors also use a similar process to aid in the search of finding a &ldquo;match&rdquo; to mentor. In addition, Recruiters also have the option to post internship and opportunities directly onto the site which then filtered results would display for the student.
