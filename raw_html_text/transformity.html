                    As busy college students, we often find ourselves stuck on campus struggling to find ways to get away from campus and have a positive impact on the local Minneapolis community. We decided we needed to change this. We often find many students our age looking to Tinder to find new people and experiences. We liked the idea behind this, and created our own version. Instead of looking for a night of fun, users who create a profile will instead be able to find volunteer events around the area. With the ease of a swipe, users can find information about the events going on, and connect with other people who will also be at those events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This idea allows for people to get connected with others coming from all ages and backgrounds, and we are excited to see the difference in local communities it can make!
