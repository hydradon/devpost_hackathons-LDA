                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kerala floods are a devastating event that has taken southern India by storm. Such a catastrophe made us realize how important it is for victims of disasters to receive medical attention as quickly as possible. We wanted to allow the affected people to receive this kind of assistance, no matter where they are in the world, no matter the amount of resources available. We believe that such an app could have a major impact on how the world responds to global disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app connects injured people with doctors around the world. People can post pictures and descriptions of their injuries or other people's injuries. Registered doctors can view these posts and write comments that offer medical advice to these patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built in Android Studio. Our database was implemented with Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of time was spent discussing the layouts and functionalities of the app, especially since it is for both the victims and the doctors. We also found the establishment of the app's database to be challenging, and had to seek several solutions before we found one that worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the teamwork and constant flow of ideas that we fostered. Using git, we were able to work on several components of the app at the same time, and were also responsive and helpful when a teammate was running into trouble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the potential roadblocks from using distributed version control and attained a deeper understanding of the Android Studio framework and IDE. We also learned how to prioritize the different features of the app, and when it is necessary to abandon certain ideas in favor of others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CollaborAid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the scope and ambition of this project, there are many ways that it could be expanded. We would like to give victims the option to report additional information, such as the person's pre-existing conditions and regular medication. We would also like CollaborAid to include a functionality that allows doctors to call or video chat victims, if desired. Finally, we would like to add a feature that would allow people to report missing people that they have found in local disaster areas.
