                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at the raspberry pi.
                    <strong>
                        I stared deeply at it and thought "what could I do?".
                    </strong>
                    Then I found it.
Because my Xbox and Computer started spazzing out earlier that day and it was still fresh on my mind, I thought, "Maybe I could turn this into a console!"
Hence the idea.

                <p>
                    It's relatively simple. You navigate It has 2 options currently: Play Game and Settings.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it for the raspberry pi. Meaning that you can't use it properly if its a regular computer.
