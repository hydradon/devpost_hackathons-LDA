                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the news that we were listening to about students around the nation having trouble with stress. We felt that it was an important topic/issue that students are struggling with, and we 7th graders wanted to do something about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a time management app, where the app can time manage the amount of time you take on a subject HW. After you finish homework, based on how long you took to finish homework, there is an option to meditate. Study shows that meditating and focusing on your breathing helps your mind to concentrate and calm down.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it from Xcode, and the language that we used was Swift.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a couple of challenges, mainly coding problems; however, we were able to overcome this problem with the amazing mentors that helped us 24/7.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud of how the app looked like, and the fact that it actually works, for most of us it was our first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally learned how to code in language Swift, and I also learned the idea of persistence and patience throughout the process.

                    Next time, we might be making a new website, or actually publishing it on the app store.
