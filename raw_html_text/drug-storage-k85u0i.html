                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted people to be able to store their own prescription information on their phone, so that they could show it to a doctor who needed that information, without waiting for another doctor's office to transfer their files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to create an account with their personal information and to store information about their prescriptions in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, GitHub, and Git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge, since we are an all rookie team. Coming up with an idea was a huge challenge. We went through many ideas that we loved but then discovered that they had already been created. Downloading Android Studio on all our devices took a long time, since it was the first time most of us had used it. Setting up our environment was also very challenging. We also spent a lot of time trying to get a couple of text recognition programs to work, which we never figured out. Also the Wifi was a challenge at times, as some of us would go long periods of time unable to connect to it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all able to create a Slack account and get that on our phones! We successfully created a login screen and a database for our app.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little bit about Android Studio, like how to make a login screen and how to store user inputed data.
                </p>

                    What's next for Drug Storage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a feature of being able to read text from a prescription and auto fill information so the user won't have to spend as much time entering the data themselves.
