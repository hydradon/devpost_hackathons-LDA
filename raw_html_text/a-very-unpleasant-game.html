                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy playing Cards Against Humanity, but we find the time to setup to take too long, and we wanted to be able to play it anywhere. This includes locations where using an internet signal is not reliable, such as on a train that is frequently going into tunnels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a group of people to use their phones to play cards against humanity, achieved in such a way that after the initial sync (done with QR codes) is complete, no further communication is done between the devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built in Android Studio for Android. We made a lot of use of the official Documentation for Android. We have also used the following library:
                    <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/barcodefraglibv2/wikis/HowTo.wiki" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    to read QR and the following library:
                    <a href="https://github.com/phishman3579/android-quick-response-code/tree/master/src/com/jwetherell/quick_response_code/result" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    for encoding QR codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding how to achieve a no communication between any of the phones, yet keep them in sync. Also, to keep in like with MHL's Code of conduct, for the purposes of this Hackathon, we have short-listed cards to Safe For Work usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No communication is required between phones, yet it is impossible for a white card to appear on more than one device at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How RecycleViews and CardViews work in Android. Implementing this was trickier than we had expected, but we feel the end result is worth it.
                </p>

                    Possible deck expansions, and possible release into the Google Play Store
