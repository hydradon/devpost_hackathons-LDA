                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to help those who face natural distasters.

                <p>
                    It is an emergency tracking system designed to help people during natural disasters to better find help and assist others along the way.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a database using Firebase to store the data from multiple different client apps. Each client app was programmed using Java and XML in android studio.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Learning how to implement Firebase into android apps; most of the team had to learn to program in Java and XML since they were used to programming in C++. We also had some problems getting the phone to record the GPS coordinates.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we over came our challenges to produce a working product, that works just like we planned. We are proud of the many things that we learned: Java, Javascript, how to use android studio, and how to implement Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of a very long night we learned how to integrate Firebase into android studio. After we crossed that hurdle we had to learn to work with Json trees in order to use the database we made with Firebase. We did manage to figure out how to import and export from the data base using Json trees and java objects. We also had a very hard time making the backend to maintain the database. We eventally thought of an out-of-the-box solution to solve the problem: we modified a copy of the client app to fill in for the back end of the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beacon-of-Hope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also plan to increase the efficiency of the backend of the database to better cycle out old data so the app can run faster and support more people. We also plan to increase the app versatilty making it more applicable and convenient during high stress situations.
