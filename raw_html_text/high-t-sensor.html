                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are people with diseases which impairs their sense of touch. They do not have a feeling of how hot or cold a particular object is. We intend to develop a prototype for a wearable glove which can sense the temperature and alert the user when needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system senses the temperature and alerts the user whenever a set threshold is exceeded. It can easily be extended to remotely alert relatives and others as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the system using a raspberry pi. The microcomputer interfaces with a temperature sensor (DS18B20), a buzzer and a LED. We used the Rockwell API to send data from the adapter (raspberry pi in this case) to the application (running on Windows) every one second. The Pi also has software that can detect when the temperature exceeds a threshold to light up a LED and ring the buzzer to alert the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being biomedical engineers, we had no prior software engineering experience. We initially wanted to upload the data on a website but had challenges doing that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use a completely new API (Rockwell API) in under 24 hours which was awesome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Temperature sensor working, APIs etc.
