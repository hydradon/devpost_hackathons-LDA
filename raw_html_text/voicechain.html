                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All over the world today, every news channel that we are exposed to have content that have a possibility of being altered or skewed to tell a story the news outlet want to tell, instead of actually telling the story the people want to tell. Every story has multiple sides with each person involved. We want those voices to be heard with no middle person in between skewing the story. Another problem with our media today is that not all stories are being heard. When companies or government that want to keep certain stories a secret, the news outlets won't tell those stories. However, with blockchain, there is no ownership. We saw the opportunity to have information posted online allowing every person to have the opportunity to have their voices heard, to have their stories told in an uncensored manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VoiceChain will allow anyone who wants to have a voice to speak up. They are free to post whatever they want, and it won&rsquo;t ever get taken down or altered because the content is not owned by anyone. With blockchain technology we allow content to be posted in a decentralized system.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Blockchain and Interplanetary file system allows our product to be decentralized (can&rsquo;t get taken down). Therefore, people can say whatever they want on this platform (with no restrictions).
