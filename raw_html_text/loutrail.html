                        The inspiration
                    </strong>
                    for this project stemmed from conversations with local business owners and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. There are outstanding characteristics about our community that's worth celebrating.  We are creatives that love our neighbors, our bourbon and our local foodie scene.  We are dedicated, investing heart and soul into our dreams and at times are ultimately being overlooked.  Nothing makes this more difficult than to have the hopes of the Derby or seasonal visitors embark upon our city but finding patrons miss out on the best Louisville has to offer.

                    </strong>
                    are unique for teams that are new to working on a collaborative project with differing ideas and possessing  development languages.

                        Accomplishments
                    </strong>
                    Diligent efforts to work together and be inclusive. We were resolved to making not only the event be a great success for everyone but to continue working through the deployment of the project.

                        What we learned
                    </strong>
                    The struggle is real. Development teams have many decisions to make.  From the languages, framework, UX, to deployment.  All with differing opinions.  The art of communication is the greatest factor to a successful project. Listen first, quietly process, share (repeat);
