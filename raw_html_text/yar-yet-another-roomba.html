                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original plan was to make a 3D mapping robot using the Kinect. The idea was to _ get _ a robot from iRobot and not do their challenge. Of course, when the Kinect ended-up not being compatible with anything we had, we gave iRobot's a go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can control the Roomba with a simple web interface that displays sensor data and a map of the distance you traveled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is even a fancy joystick-like interface that's super-usable from a touchscreen. Also, since the robot runs a Node server, it's possible for the client to not be tethered to the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python to interface with the Robot and Node.js to drive the front-end. Flask would have been the obvious choice but it was too late to switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communicating in real-time between Python and Node proved to be a challenge. Luckily, Python provides unorthodox ways to communicate with the external word. Just open
                    <code>
                        data.py
                    </code>
                    to see how it works...
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communicating between Python and Node.js in an elegant manner.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the interface to display data. Also, it's powered by nipple.js

                <h2>
                    What we've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Evaluate the stack
                    <strong>
                        before
                    </strong>
                    you start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, hardware
                    <strong>
                        will
                    </strong>
                    fail you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To keep working on it I would need to purchase a Roomba... So you can guess.
