                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There have been shootings that occur in America, and sadly it became more frequent in today's society. We made this program to ensure the safety of the people in our day and age. We want to prevent the loss of family and loved ones that occurs when the tragic event happens. If we can warn people early before the event happens, then maybe it could lessen the harsh injuries or deaths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The point of the project is to identify weapons on a person, and be able to warn people ahead of time if they are pulling the weapon. The software goes through every pixel on an image and looks for colors and shapes that resemble the a gun. The pixels that resemble a gun will be marked red. Ideally, this sotware would be implimented in the surviellence cameras in schools, hospitals, and other public areas in order to warn officials when someone is carrying a gun in unauthorized areas. Due to the time restriction and current skillset, we weren't able to able to make our software work with live video but we used images as a concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I Built This
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This software was built using Matlab. We thought it would be interesting to use a non-traditional language. We would import an image and the code would find trends in color and shape that resembled a gun. The code would find the center point of the gun and highlight it red as well as other pixels in the image that resembled a gun. Once the code was done processing the image, it would display image before and after processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have faced a challenge of learning a new language. It took time learning how most of the format works on the Matlab language at the beginning. Guns are typically black so it was difficult to get the program to not highlight everything dark. It was also difficult getting the centroid of the weapon. We spent a lot of time trying to make the red highlights opaque but were uncessful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on a project that involved imaging processing was a daughting task for us. We had never done such a thing before but thought this would be a great opportunity to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to import images to matlab and modify them as well as add objects to the image. Learning more about the RBG scale was also fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safety Identification
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will make the software outline and highlight guns with greater accuracy. We will also make the highlighting more opaque. Eventually we would like to get the software to work with video and and live video.
