                <p>
                    167 countries have at least one law on the books that restricts women&rsquo;s economic opportunity. Women still need their husband&rsquo;s permission to get a job in 18 countries. Women are prevented from working the same night hours as men in 29 countries, including India, which prohibits them from working in factories between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.

                    . In China, this discrimination can be implemented on a much more granular lever, with your social credit score getting dinged if you happen to buy the wrong thing (like a book on witchcraft or a Practical Magic box set).

                    We thought if DAO's like Moloch and MetaCartel DAO's can be used to pool funds and direct them to grants, why not create a Moloch like structure where deposits earn interest, and the membership can loan it out. Creating an economic benefit for members and allowing the system to grow.

                    We built a smart contract &amp; UI that:

                <ul>

                        mints &amp; burns Coven Shares(CVN) based on deposit &amp; current supply

                    <li>
                        Deposits and withdraws Coven funds into an interest earning protocol (AAVE)

                    <li>
                        let's members borrow from the Coven at an interest rate

                    Mostly the time constraint of building a smart contract from scratch, and integrating with a protocol we're unfamiliar with.
