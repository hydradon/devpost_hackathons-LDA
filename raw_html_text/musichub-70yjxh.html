                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music streaming services today have very little social aspect to them, and no collaborative aspect - those were the main inspirations for creating MusicHub. MusicHub is built on the ideas of collaboration and open source music - many artists come together to create a piece of music, similar to a site like GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MusicHub is a social media platform as well as music streaming/creating platform, where you can create a project and have many people upload edits, resulting in a finely tuned finished project that was worked on by many people. Scrolling through your feed, you can like a song, and your friends will see the songs that you've liked. There will also be a Ranking page of the artists with the most likes on pieces they've collaborated on in that current month. At the end of each month, a mixtape will be released of the songs with the most likes, which will be monetized, and the revenue will be returned to the artists who contributed to these pieces on a "percent-of-song-contributed-to" basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built all 722 lines of the site myself, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript. I built it from scratch with example artists and profiles to be able to have a visual example of how the site will function once we've implemented all of the APIs for our insite-music compositor, and sign in and home feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that I ran into was ensuring that my business idea was something that holds actual value. I surveyed many of the other particpants in the hackathon and made sure to tailor the features of the site to be able to solve many of the issues that people expressed with their current music streaming services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how coherent my website is, as it took an extremely long time to implement a front end on the site. I am also very proud of the business idea, as I think this has actual potential market value, as it is extremely unique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a significant amount about project brainstorming, as well as how to design a business plan in order to make a project scalable and not having any monetary loopholes for those using the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MusicHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for MusicHub, I will continue to develop the site, clean up the code, make it more responsive on the front using some media queries, and try to implement a particles.js homepage. I will also be developing the bank end and proper network and security required to have a social media site where users can log in and have a unique experience. I will likely do this with node.js and PHP.
