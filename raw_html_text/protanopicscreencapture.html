                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend is colorblind and sometimes when I send him screenshots, he doesn't understand 
what he's supposed to be looking at, so this will help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps people take screenshots so that people with red-green color vision deficiency can
see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using Java and lots of love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't directly access the OS easily through Java, so we had to change our project midway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the features that we added after we thought we finished our project. Originally, we only had
the option to screenshot for protanomaly but we also added a feature for a regular screenshot
and deuteranomaly, as well as a feature to go back to the instruction screen and to scroll
through the current session's screencaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To run this program, double click on the ProtanopicScreenCapture.jar file. A
new window will open with the instructions. To take a color adjusted screenshot,
press 'F6' and the window will display the modified screenshot. The screenshot
is saved to the MyScreenshots folder. To quit, press 'Q'.
