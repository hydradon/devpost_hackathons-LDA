                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this game came from many stealth games such as Assassin's Creed and Thief. In these games, you must sneak around your enemy to achieve the goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Stealthy Boi, players play as a ninja, avoiding patrolling enemies to reach the end of the level. The game is very fun and addictive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with concepts on paper, with ideas such as a desert sandbox game, puzzle games, and a ninja game. Then, after deciding our topic, we dove into unity and started creating the game. The models were all made in blender and the 2D graphics were made in Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, time. Time was the biggest issue of all. Another major issue that we eventually overcame was the enemy AI. AI was very difficult in the beginning, but after an excruciating amount of planning, we managed to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is especially proud of the enemy AI and the grapple hook. These two features make the game what it is. Both were difficult to create at first, but after planning, it wasn't all that bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon taught the team about the reality of deadlines. We began with a website, and ended with a game. We realized the website was more than we could handle because of the lack of time and foreknowledge about progressive web apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stealthy Boi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stealthy Boi is only in its alpha stage. We hope to implement multiplayer capabilities, leader boards, story-mode, and more equipment and features.
