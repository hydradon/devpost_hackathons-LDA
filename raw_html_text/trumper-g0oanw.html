                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve seen Trump tweet time and time again. There is some kind of magic to his tweets- something that makes them so similar yet so personal to his own style. We&rsquo;ve spent countless hours on twitter looking at Trump&rsquo;s twitter- reading (trying to decipher, rather) the tweets. Thus, we knew that we wanted to do something related to these tweets, and after thinking long and hard, we settled on Trumper- our very own Trump tweet generator/game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trumper generates new tweets in order to display using a Markov chain. It presents the user with tweets and asks them to decide whether the tweet is a real Trump tweet or if the tweet was created by Trumper. Each decision is timed, and at the end of the game, the user is provided with a score that allows them to see how they did. Our score formula factors in both their score and the time it took the user to make an accurate decision.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using a lot of different tools. It is primarily built using python and a Flask backend that allow us to look through our dataset of previous Trump tweets and generate ones that are all new. We used HTML, JS, and CSS for the front end, and the the sound files are also included in order to make the game more realistic.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a lot of challenges with making it completely independent. Our product, by the end, works entirely off of the website and is not reliant on scripts or files stored on the computer. This was especially difficult because a lot of what we wanted to do we realized was dependent on the computer, which defeated the purpose of making a game that anyone can play regardless of their physical location.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we were able to get this up and running on a website. We are very proud of the fact that anyone can use our product and that we will be able to use this in the future without needing downloaded files or anything like that. We are also happy that our markov chain provides us with accurate Trump tweets, the similarities between our tweets and trump&rsquo;s tweets are incredibly uncanny. This web application could probably even confuse Trump himself.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about markov chains and going through a dataset in order to make new tweets comprised of informatic with semantic similarities. We learned a lot about how to make new things from old ones, as well sa how to use python to do so.

                    What's next for Trumper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up next for Trumper is further refinement. The website Trumper.life is now up and running, and soon people from around the world will begin to use Trumper. We believe that our product will never stop it&rsquo;s evolution, and we remain committed to ensuring that we continually and periodically update Trumper with necessary changes.
