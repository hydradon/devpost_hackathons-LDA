                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reading about how retail and grocery stores decide where to place their products, we decided that we can improve existing solutions to this problem to provide more accurate data in addition to stronger insights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overview is that by adding sensors to shopping carts, we can collect data on how customers shop and send this data to a central server that analyzes the data and provides insights on the store's layout. We have prototyped a sensor that sends location data to a server that would be located within the store, and have built a web application that will provide easy to use analytics for the client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS for our backend and React for the frontend. We are using Firebase for the database. We prototyped a sensor with an Arduino and also a mobile app to simulate a sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have access to all the hardware we wanted to use, resulting in our Arduino's data being less precise than we hoped for. This threw us off plan but we figured out a solution by creating a simple mobile app for Android that would send more precise and accurate GPS data to our server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that we are proud of as a team is that we identified an area in the industry and developed a solution that has value for businesses and uses technology to create new insights and analytics we may have not had before. In addition, we're proud of being able to learn new tools and technologies such as Firebase which we can use in future projects and experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned new tools such as Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future of this project, we would like to improve our hardware by making a sensor that has more precise and accurate location data and to have more features available for insights.
