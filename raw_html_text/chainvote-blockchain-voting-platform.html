                <p>
                    The inspiration for EthVote is rooted in the essence of blockchain technology, which aims to provide a transparent and secure way to store and transact with data online. Our team members come from Italy and Brazil, and have witnessed how corruption can impact the political system. Hence, we decided to use DLT, integrating blockchain to an election platform to allow for:

                <p>
                    EthVote allows the government of a country to run a transparent, secure and simplified election. For this first implementation, we focused on a Nigerian presidential election.

                    <li>

                    Regulators have almost the same powers as the "inec" address, except they cannot start or end the election, or register candidates. These regulators are, for example, municipality and local governments, which will be taking care of voter registration in their communities.

                    A voter will personally go to a licensed regulator location to register. The agent will verify their Identification and use their name and ID to initiate the registration process. The name and ID will be hashed on the client-side, using SHA-256, and the voter will then choose an Ethereum address, which will be hashed together with the previous hash, to create a voter "log-in".

                    The user will use their name and ID to log-in from the designated address. This verification will be done by the smart contract, as opposed to the client. They will then input a PIN code which will be hashed, added to the previous hashes, and hashed again. This unique hash will define in the smart contract the voting rights for one user. With this, the voter will then be able to use any Ethereum address to vote in an anonymous manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hash 3 = H(n)

                    After the "inec" address calls a function to start the election, time will start counting down towards its end. Voters will not be able to register during this period and voting will be opened to the public. Each voter can only vote once, for one candidate only.

                <p>
                    -Anyone can easily verify the status of the election at no cost. Functions of the type 'view' are implemented to allow for an easy checking of the total vote count and the votes each candidate has received.
-The 'vote' function will always return the message  "Your vote has been counted. Thank you for voting", and the client will alert that message, even when the vote has not actually been counted. This is a mechanism to prevent people from forcing others to vote for a certain candidate, so that voters under those circumstances can intentionally misspell their name, ID, PIN or address and the vote will not be counted, but for the person forcing them to vote, it will show as if it did.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <strong>
                        How can we use distributed ledger technology while maintaining real-life governance aspects?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While DLT initiatives are coming up with solutions that do not need the input of governments or other regulators, country-wide elections still need to maintain some sort of authority protocol, such that the election process can be properly monitored and executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, we created a hierarchy system, through which the government can assign trusted parties to take part in the registration process of candidates and voters, while maintaining some form of control over the running of the election, although unable to tamper with the results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, citizens benefit from the simplicity of the new platform, while being able to verify that the voting process is being executed as it should, due to the transparency of the Ethereum network. However, the government still retains the necessary power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How can we provide transparency and security in the voting process while preserving voter privacy?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simplest possible implementation of an election smart contract would involve allowing one vote per address. However, the problem with that implementation is that people could simply use other addresses and vote more than once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem then becomes: how do we link an address to an actual person? Well, the answer to this question requires a centralising agent, a regulator, who will physically verify the identity of the person, and assign them one vote on the smart contract. This implementation solves the double-vote issue, but not the privacy issue. If the assigned agent is the one who inputs the data and assigns the vote, he/she could:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a) Steal the vote, depending on how the contract implements the vote assignment
b) See the vote, which breaches personal privacy
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we created an implementation which combines off-chain and in-chain hashing, together with a two-step voter registration process, which ultimately allows a voter to vote from any address of their choice, given that they can provide all the necessary information used in the registration process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, we can guarantee that no voter votes twice, while allowing a voter to be sure that his vote is anonymous.
