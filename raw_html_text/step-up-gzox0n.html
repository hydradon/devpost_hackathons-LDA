                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StepUp! was inspired by the concept of gamification. By letting people compare their activity to others, they associate positive feelings with being active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StepUp! shows you how active your friends were over a given period and motivates you to be more active by reminding you to go out for a run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepUp! measures your activity in two time periods: The morning (midnight-noon) and the evening (noon-midnight.) By having these distinct timeframes, people are able to experience more success (getting more steps than their friends did in that time) and associate more positive feelings with physical activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StepUp! runs on a combination of Pebble C, PebbleKit JS and Python in the OpenShift cloud (RedHat's PaaS platform)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very happy about the friending system that StepUp! employs. Users can accept friend requests without needing to use their phone or an external web service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Step Up!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StepUp! will be available in the Pebble App Store following the public release of firmware 3.9, which adds support for the Health API.
                </p>
