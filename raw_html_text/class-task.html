                    Inspiration Being students we have a lot of assignments to complete, so we decided on making it easier for everyone on what assignments to complete based on high priority levels we tested against.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does The app creates a todo list based on current grade in the class, grade weight for assignments, time of completion, level of difficulty of the professor and smaller priority levels. Once each of the conditions is compared against, the app shows what assignments are best to do in order with the student able to choose which to tasks to progress in.

                    Challenges we ran into A lot of us were unfamiliar with git and some aspects of android studio pertaining to connecting pages, background schemes, java files, classes etc, but we definitely powered through by reading, applying programming knowledge and asking questions to some of the mentors here at Technica.
