                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The inspiration for this project came from a desire to discover new music from random people around us. Music is important to most of us, and this is a new way to create connections with people purely based on their music tastes.

                    <li>
                        Users will be able to stream Spotify through the app, and have it displayed on a map, where other users can interact with each other's Spotify profiles, playlists, and currently playing music.

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We built the app using a Firebase database to store users' locations, Spotify iOS SDK to authenticate and share music content, including song, artist, album info, etc., and Swift to create the framework for the app.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                being able to send location updates to database in a synchronous fashion
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Spotify iOS SDK implementation, authentication
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                stylizing basic Swift iOS elements, like search functionality and transitions
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                initial Spotify login screen, onboarding
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We were able to create a successful database that held and updated users' locations, and displayed them on the map. We were also able to implement a live network of Spotify users and their music, making it easier for people to expand their tastes and preferences.

                </ul>

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It can always be a challenge to work with new software, so past experience and research is always welcome. We also learned a lot about specific technologies such as iOS MapKit, Firebase, and API implementation.

                        Fine-tuning features and marketing, since byter is a crowdsourced app, marketing and outreach is going to be our next step to guarantee the success of our project.
