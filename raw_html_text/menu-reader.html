                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an easy way to get the dining hall's menu using Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads the menu of one of the dining halls at UCSC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the example codes given by Amazon and modified it to suit our needs. To be specific, everyone started by trying to get hello world to work. Then the hello world code was changed to instead read out the entire menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and we were all beginners. Everything had to be learned, how to scrape a page for text, how to make an Alexa skill, how to use Gradle, etc. The 12 hour time limit was also very stressful to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made Alexa do what we wanted! We got her to collect the entire menu and read it out loud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Jsoup to collect information from a webpage and prepare it so it is in an easily understandable format when read aloud by Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Menu Reader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to read only a specific meal, to read another dining hall's menu, and perhaps the ability to read foods made with only a certain ingredient.
