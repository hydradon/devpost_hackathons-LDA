                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our lives are so dynamic. The many aspects of our school life, families, friends, hobbies, and more all have their demands to our time and attention. A lack of organization, in my experience, can make one feel lost.  When life becomes overwhelming, it can feel like a stressful juggling act trying to maintain and handle all your priorities. Nobody should have to neglect certain aspects of their life just to stay afloat in another part of their life. School can be very stressful, and we want to perform at our best. Visually seeing when assignments are coming, and writing down what homework we need to do is very helpful. With that, we must not forget most importantly our health and happiness. Balance is essential. When striving for our goals and working hard we must remember to take care of ourselves, and think of the bigger picture of who we are and what we enjoy. Having all of these aspects laid out in a single planner can show the relationship these parts of our lives have to make our lives what they are.

                    I learned that one should never be intimidated to turn their ideas into a reality. I learned that even with no experience, and just hardwork and dedication, there is a world of resources in tech and the most helpful people to guide you. Also coding isn't as scary as it looks!
