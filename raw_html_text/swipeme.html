                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MTA keeps raising it's prices. We were inspired by our friend who always gives swipes from her unlimited card to strangers as she exits the subway system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people currently in transit to a destination with those who are starting their journey at that same station
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With React-Native and PubNub to allow for quick communication between people.
We used PolyLines in react-native-maps to draw the subway map, custom markers f\
or the stations, and PubNub on the back end for connecting users in transit to \
users ready to depart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We made all of this in 16 hours
                </p>

                    A lot about PubNub

                    What's next for SwipeMe
                </h2>

                    Many features will be added to SwipeMe in the future such as allowing a user to pick an exact route from Google Maps API.
