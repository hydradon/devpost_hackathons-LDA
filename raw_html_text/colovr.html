                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ColoVR is a virtual experience allowing users to modify their environment with colors and models. It's a relaxing, low poly experience that is the first of its kind to bring an accessible 3D experience to the Google Cardboard platform. It's a great way to become a creative in 3D without dropping a ton of money on VR hardware.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Daydream and extended off of the demo scene to our liking. We used Unity and C# to create the scene, and do all the user interactions. We did painting and dragging objects around the scene using a common graphics technique called Ray Tracing. We colored the scene by changing the vertex color. We also created a palatte that allowed you to change tools, colors, and insert meshes. We hand modeled the low poly meshes in Maya.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was finding a proper mechanism for coloring the geometry in the scene. We first tried to paint the mesh face by face, but we had no way of accessing the entire face from the way the Unity mesh was set up. We then looked into an asset that would help us paint directly on top of the texture, but it ended up being too slow. Textures tend to render too slowly, so we ended up doing it with a vertex shader that would interpolate between vertex colors, allowing real time painting of meshes. We implemented it so that we changed all the vertices that belong to a fragment of a face. The vertex shader was the fastest way that we could render real time painting, and emulate the painting of a triangulated face. Our second biggest challenge was using ray tracing to find the object we were interacting with. We had to navigate the Unity API and get acquainted with their Physics raytracer and mesh colliders to properly implement all interaction with the cursor. Our third challenge was making use of the Controller that Google Daydream supplied us with -  it was great and very sandboxed, but we were almost limited in terms of functionality. We had to find a way to be able to change all colors, insert different meshes, and interact with the objects with only two available buttons.

                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to get a clean, working project that was exactly what we pictured. People seemed to really enjoy the concept and interaction.

                    What's next for ColoVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hats, interactive collaborative space for multiple users. We want to be able to host the scene and make it accessible to multiple users at once, and store the state of the scene (maybe even turn it into an infinite world) where users can explore what past users have done and see the changes other users make in real time.
