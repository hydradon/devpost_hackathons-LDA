                <p>
                    Through EMG signals and speech commands the bionic robotic hand will able to behave .

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first designed the 3D hands, there are more than 20 pieces. Then we setup the framework for signal/speech recolonization, this was done through the micro-chips we made on-sight and machine learning script from scratch. Then we assembled everything together to make a biotic-robotic arm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning to use EMG signals as the input, then though a simple machine learning model to output signals to the servos that allow hand to move. However, this didn't work as we expected due to the solder damaged our chips. We were unable to make the small conduct work.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to program via Raspberry Pi 3B and make the hand moving from our commands.
