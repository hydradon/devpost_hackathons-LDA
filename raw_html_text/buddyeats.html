                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking around in our dining courts, we noticed tons of people sitting alone. With our app, that's no longer a problem for people who actually want to eat with someone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After signing up with buddy eats, users can get started by picking their preferred dining court to eat at. Any users using the app at the same time and that selects the same dining court will show up on the Buddy List. From there, they have the option to view buddy profiles and confirm their buddy. Both parties have to confirm for you to get your buddy. After confirmation and match are successful, an in-app messaging feature allows both parties to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built buddy eats using Xcode in Swift with Firebase APIs and Scaledrone frameworks for the in-app messaging feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering Swift recently updated, there isn't a lot of documentation on the changes in notation and version updates. From previous articles, we encountered errors due to those version updates and the tutorial being outdated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to integrate multiple different components using Firebase, installing pods, with zero to limited knowledge of it beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate Firebase and pods to create different features in our app. We learned how to take old, outdated code and rewrite it to match the current versions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BuddyEats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make BuddyEats fully functional and iron out any imperfections/weaknesses in the app.
