                    Inspiration: A lot of food is wasted every day. In order to reduce this wastage, we came up with this app so that surplus food can be sold at a smaller prize.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: supermarkets who have surplus food which is soon going to expire can be sold at a much lower price to those who need it. This app can bridge the gap between these two.

                    How we built it: We build it using android studios.

                    Challenges we ran into: we were unfamiliar with android app development. Also firebase was something which we have not explored before. But I think we did a pretty good job together.
