                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see how far we could take the concept of "learning through interaction". Google Translation gave us that very great opportunity to try it out for ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a webcam + audio stream service that can translate a user's words in real-time to any foreign language of their choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated Google Cloud Services' Translation and Speech Recognition APIs to give our language learners a full-bodied interactive experience. The backend is Node.js, deployed in a Heroku container.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the difficulty from this project came from our initial expectations to incorporate hardware (such as an audio device) into our hack, which we decided at a late hour to discard for this more interesting opportunity to play around with Google APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many of our team members, it was a first-time hackathon. We are proud to have come up with an completed a cool project, using a couple neat tools at our disposal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The many challenges of development operations and how to wade through API documentation to find what we were looking for.

                    What's next for Triolingo

                <p>
                    Developing a fully-fleshed service that can allow multiple users to video-chat with each other in translated real-time.
