                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration cane from within ourselves.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessio is an easy to use door monitoring system turned into a camera networking system with iOS integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ultrasonic distance sensors (connected to the raspberri pi) to determine when a door was open. Once the door opened, we are able to take a picture using the webcam attached to the rapberry pi. The picture is now sent through our facial recognition system to determine if there is a visible face within the picture.
If the picture contains a visible face, this information is sent to a server hosted by Amazon Web Services where the information is assorted into a JSON script and pushed to the iOS app everytime someone enters the door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea was to incorporate the use of bluetooth technology to determine when and who is entering the door, however we soon realized that our current bluetooth dongles are not dependable enough to determine who is at the door. Upon this discovery, we decided to modify our project and to use a webcam instead.
