                        pain

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly I leverage on Google Speech API (Speech Recognition) to detect words from the audio source. I use fluent-ffmpeg to manipulate the video data (getting the audio from video, merging the subtitles with the video).

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a freshmen with no experience in using the Speech API nor the ffmpeg library. I came with an idea without any knowledge on how to execute it. So I had to explore the options and just try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also callback hell is still a thing because ffmpeg doesnt use promises :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...Also, recording a meta presentation is a bit tough.

                    This is my first ever solo hackathon and I managed to complete the project on my own. So that's substantial to me. I joined this hackathon with the intention to win. So if I do, that would be awesome!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I am actually happier and more productive going solo because this idea is freshly my own and not from a group. So seeing it comes to fruition is best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides it, I learnt a bit of machine learning from the workshop. I am quite clear now how Google Speech API works as well as ffmpeg.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had the idea to make a webpage for it but that means users will have to upload the video to my server, so I think it is better to keep it as a script file where only the audio is uploaded to the Speech API.
