                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people have already made attempts to help manage time, such as using a calendar or using an agenda. Despite the hard efforts made by developers, many bugs and extra costs remain. The chronotracker&trade; is better than that. The chronotracker&trade;
                    <i>
                        works
                    </i>
                    .

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With features like listening to music, live chats to help with any subject and many more, you can be the most productive and organized person in your school or workplace.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our basic structural planning was done on paper. In the following hours, we proceeded to program the app on Scratch, then created a HTML website to feature the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a bit of a while, many of the features of the app had several bugs. The limited sensing features in Scratch was a difficult challenge to overcome in modeling the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The many features we were able to incorporate and how close we got to a real application made it a satisfying achievement!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This experience greatly taught us to work together better and use time efficiently. The steps involved in making this project gave us new challenges to program and more resources to use in the future.

                <p>
                    Though it's not quite yet usable to everyone, we hope to complete this project with a bit more time and make it available to anyone. This amazing app will hopefully grow to hold more features and be shared across the world!
