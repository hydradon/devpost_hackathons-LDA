                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you could compress hours of work into minutes even seconds. What if you no longer have to search for data, but it presents itself. Hackdat is reflected by our desire for efficiency, our passion for productive workflow, and the chance for engineers to innovate elsewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackdat parses pdfs of datasheets for integrated circuits using natural-language-processing to extrapolate meaningful data. This saves hours of time for engineers who spend countless hours combing through data sheets looking for the desired information. This time could better be used to innovate in their respective design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that utilized natural-language-processing and a pdf parsing library. It was hosted on git pages with a .tech domain: hackdat.tech.
