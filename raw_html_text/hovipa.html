                    College is a first step towards how you grow into your adult self. For many, college relationships have a big impact on how young individuals develop their concept of a healthy relationship. Those experiences determine their expectations in an intimate relationship. Intimate partner violence is a major issue on college campuses. We as a group, wanted to raise awareness for this major issues on college campuses by creating a social awareness and advocacy interactive simulation. "21% of college students report having experienced dating violence by a current partner, and 32% of college students report experiencing dating violence by a previous partner," as reported by Healing Abuse Working For Change (HAWC). According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, "1 in 4 women (24.3%) and 1 in 7 men (13.8%) aged 18 and older in the United States have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime." 
We watched to address how the unique environment of a college campus and how signs of Intimate Partner Violence presents itself.

                    This was the first time any of us had worked on anything involving virtual reality technology, so there were a lot of unexpected hurdles and roadblocks we encountered. Originally we had wanted to integrate our A-frame project into the Oculus Rift, however A-Frame does not have a compatible API to work with Oculus. Eventually we switched our focus on developing something that would work with the cardboard.

                    That VR reality building is very complicated, and a lot to take on for a hackathon project having never worked on a VR environment before. However we learned how to create an A-Frame virtual reality experience without having any prior knowledge of how it works.
