                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're motivated by the necessity to remove linguistic barriers to information and enable access to both sides of a story.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you search the web in a language you know(eg. English ) for information that might be present in a foreign tongue. This project is a result of labour of love.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We translate your QUERY into languages of your choice. We then search the internet for both your query and the Translated Queries.  The results of the queries are then RANKED using algorithms trained on MS Marco reranking. We then take the top 5 resulting pages and using our QUESTION ANSWERING system to extract an answer to your searched Query instead of just showing you a list of pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we faced was handling a high volume of translation traffic.
