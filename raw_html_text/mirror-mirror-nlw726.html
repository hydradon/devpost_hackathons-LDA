                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reading about HeforShe and hearing Emma Watson's opening speech, we thought that we would take our own personal spin on how to achieve gender parity.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mirror, mirror is a cross platform application that seeks to empower the younger generation in realizing their full potential through continuous positive messages. We've built a working website and would like to push out an app as well as physical product into the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are first time hackers and we built a website using brackets. We also used arduinos and other hardware to try and prototype the mirror.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are first timers and spent a lot of time brainstorming as well as figuring out code &amp; hardware. Everything was a learning process for us. It was frustrating to have an idea but not know how to fully implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a website with live webcam feature that we hope to expand upon in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. But seriously, everything we did this project we learned during this time period so that was really awesome.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mirror Mirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've detailed that in our submission, but we're hoping to build an app as well as launch a physical product.
