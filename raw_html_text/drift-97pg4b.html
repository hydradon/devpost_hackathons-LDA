                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a racing game with a unique feel that favored the action side of the genre. Of course, we still had many sources of information we drew from. For example, we were impressed by the high stakes feel of games like Asphalt and CoD. We also wanted to add a more technical side to the game amidst the mayhem, and the in-game augments were based off League of Legends' skill system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drift is a racing game where each of the vehicles carries a weapon. Much like other games of its genre, the goal of the game is to win the race by crossing the finish line twice (2 laps). However, you can disturb and set back your opponents by shooting at them. Each shot that hits them lowers their HP, and when a player's health reaches 0 they are sent back to the nearest checkpoint they crossed. The game also has augments, which are special abilities you can use to turn the tide of the game (battle? race?). Examples of augments include, shield, dash, and nuke.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity game engine and C# to build this game. Most components involved a heavy use of physics, such as collision detection, trigonometry, vector calculations, and force calculations. Static variables store the user's choice of car, difficulty level, and augment. To prevent a player from cheating in the race by simply moving backwards to the finish line, checkpoints throughout the course are in place. Players must pass all checkpoints and then proceed to the finish line in order for it to count as a lap.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to add multiplayer during HackPHS, but we found out that the Unity Multiplayer feature was deprecated recently and many parts of it were removed. If we were to do this project again I definitely would've researched multiplayer more beforehand.
We also ran into a problem with the colliders

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Franklin: I designed the AI for the car, something that I didn't think I could do.
Rishi: I made really good UI elements for the game, and they are the best I have ever made.
Vagish: This is my first 24 hour hackathon, and I'm proud of how much I've learned during this time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Franklin: I learned about instantiating temporary objects and how to write a basic AI that follows an algorithm to meet needs.
Rishi:  I learned how to use Unity Physics to achieve what I want.
Vagish: I learned the basics of Unity, with a focus on terrain editing.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Drift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add the ability to customize weapons and tracks. Another fun addition we are considering is a battle royale mode with cars, as weapons are already a major part of the game. If we had the money, we would try to make custom assets and add multiplayer support.
