                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What drove us to work on this project was an issue that we found to be annoying, but prevalent, at hackathons - finding an available space to work. After experiencing this at more than one hackathon, we came to the agreement as a team that this process could be improved. So we took the challenge.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HacKonneKt streamlines communication between hackathon organizers and participants, and allows participants to efficiently find and select spaces for hacking. HacKonnekt allows administrators to label available rooms and allows participants to signup for rooms online, all while automatically updating participants on room availability in real time. Administrators can also use HacKonnekt can send real time updates and reminders of the hackathon event schedule through our Twilio-based text messaging system.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build this application, we uploaded a pre-filled Google spreadsheet with hackathon registrant information into a MongoDB database using node.js APIs. We then created two interfaces on the front-end, one that is admin-facing and the other is user-facing. We connected our front end and back ends and integrated the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble integrating the Twilio API with our MongoDB server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete our project and successfully send and receive messages via Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained tremendous experience in JavaScript, node.js, and MongoDB - especially Twilio.
