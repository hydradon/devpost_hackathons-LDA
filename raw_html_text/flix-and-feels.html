                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted try out a hardware hack at Hack Western and decided to go with the Muse because it seemed really cool. A lot of our friends who weren't in Computer Science started suggesting this idea to us, because they would always have to fight over what movie to watch all the time. Therefore, we came up with a way to use Muse EEG data to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flix and Feels is a desktop applet that measures your EEG data using the Muse headband,compares it to threshold values for emotions such as calm, happy and sad. Using this classification, we are able to suggest randomly tabulated movies lists that fall under a range of genres matching your feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire program is coded in Java, and uses the OSC server to connect the Muse Headband IO to a Java program, and transfer raw EEG data from the user. It then uses datapoints to calculate your emotion. An API called The Movie Database API is used to find and display a list of movies matching the emotion.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the API was definitely a challenge, as well as working with the applet structure in Java.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype and we don't have think too hard about what movie to watch anymore!
                </p>

                    How to integrate an API into a program, working with the Muse headband, creating an applet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flix and Feels
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ideal would be to create an android app for this program and to expand into displaying TV shows. Also, including a wider range of emotion threshold values would be amazing.
