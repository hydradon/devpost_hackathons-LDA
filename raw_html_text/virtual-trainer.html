                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of my friends and I use exercise applications to track our workout progress but many of them are overly complicated to set up and get started or were developed only to work for a single work out routine. We wanted to replace these traditional applications with a user-friendly version that made it easy to get started but maintained all of the functionality of a typical workout application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our virtual trainer looks to replace overly complicated exercise applications on the App Store with a user-friendly, easy to use workout tracker. Our tracker:
Reminds you of your workouts
Warms you up by gradually increasing the weight of your lifts from set to set
Times your breaks between workout sets
Will recommend workout routines for those completely new to the gym
Create routines for cardio, cutting fat, maintaining muscle/overall strength building, or bulking up
Adjusts the weight of future exercises based on whether or not you can successfully complete an exercise
Multiple incompletions will lower the weights for you
Success will increase the weight gradually between days
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a large period of time at the beginning of the hackathon to consider the design of the user-interface. Since we wanted the application to be accessible for beginners, we had to make the application intuitive enough to easily navigate through the creation of a routine. Most of the dirty work is handled by the application in the background where we calculate the weight of your lifts, number of sets, and number of reps.
