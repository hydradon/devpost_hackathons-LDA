                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experienced difficulties during our freshman year attempting to complete any sort of paper work regarding our status as students. We thought we could make a light hearted game about our experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main character is charged with the task of switching majors and has to go through a series of challenges and battles with various computer players to complete his mission. He travels all around Riddelia to create his four year plan traveling from the college of arts and crafts to the library and office of the advisers of first yearlings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wrote a full script of all the dialogue and interactions between characters. Then we designed the map to be like a college campus including the interiors of all the buildings. The designs of the characters were also made in the same program. Finally, the dialogue was transferred from the word document into the actual game. We wrote the code for the interactions between the character and the computer and adjusted the drag and drop item's code as needed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the syntax correct for the interactions between the characters was difficult to get correct the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cup stacking Champions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how time consuming large scale worlds in role playing games can be even when using a drag and drop software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Riddelia Run Around: Journey of the four year plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that this will raise public awareness as to the problems caused by the riddle run and that this will ultimately help the school create a faster process for helping students.
