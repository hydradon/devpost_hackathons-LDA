                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were out of ideas and we found a no-code solution to help automate the loan process
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an easy-to use app that can save responses to a spreadsheet and can use responses to automatically populate other forms. It can send notification and confirmation emails to people who complete the application (confirmation emails) and to inform administrators of submissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Formstack. It was very easy to use. No long tutorials necessary. All fields and rules were pretty much just drag and drop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formstack is so secure that it flags certain fields if it is suspected to request sensitive information. I had to get the form whitelisted in order to be published because it asked for a utility "account number". Their technicians were quick to respond and verified my form was not asking for bank account numbers. Formstack is capable of securing forms, but it requires enabling encryption and enhanced permissions for viewing the sensitive data. The email responses also have to be configured so none of the sensitive fields are sent over email, the form will get flagged and taken down if not.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of figuring this app out in such a short amount of time.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to always have a backup plan because sometimes plans don't work out
                </p>

                    Different types of users and permissions can be configured, Work Flows can be created, various apps like DropBox, Google Forms, and Salesforce can be integrated. You choose where you want the information saved.
