                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working on building an immersive coding educational platform. We started with Alexa because it&rsquo;s ease of use and great interaction model. The idea of waking up and saying &ldquo;Alexa, ask Devhulk to teach me something&rdquo; seemed like a great way to challenge yourself as a young person to learn programming terminology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After asking Devhulk to teach you something you will be read a programming term like &ldquo;variable&rdquo;. You will then be told the definition and how to use it in a sentence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a lambda function with modified terms to be easier to understand from a young adult/ new to programming perspective. The Alexa skill is called Devhulk.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changing complex technical definitions into more easily understandable definitions, that are still accurate.

                    What I learned

                    Voice interaction is powerful.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to add terms and release video content that complements the skill. That way it really starts to create a more immersive learning experience.
