                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build something for social good, and we chose to focus on helping natural disaster victims. We realize that natural disaster victims lack resources and are in great need of help, but they are not necessarily available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HELPY aims to connect natural disaster victims with people who are willing to supply the needed resources that the victims are seeking. Additionally, natural disaster victims are able to seek and request resources on HELPY.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, a basic wireframe was designed on Adobe XD to configure the user experience of interacting with HELPY. Following this, we tried to reimplement the wireframe into HTML and Javascript and then host the site on a Google Cloud Service Server with Node.js. For the chat feature, we used Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, the Twilio API returned several errors which took several hours to debug and resolve. A major challenge with HELPY was stitching together the different pieces of the project, from front-end to back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were able to experience the process of web development. Coming in, we, as a team, were all highly interested in building a website towards social good, and by realizing this goal during this project/hackathon allowed us to take the first steps in that direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are aiming for the Best Social Good Hack, Most Fun and Most Technical
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop the initial steps of web development, which we all previously were not familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HELPY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, HELPY is designed for people who are able to give resources to natural disaster victims. Following this, we would like to focus on the other side, the people who need these resources.
                </p>
