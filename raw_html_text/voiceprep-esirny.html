                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interviews can be difficult for a lot of students if they don't have experience. How common nerves can cause missed opportunities, as well as the lack of good preparation methods inspired us to create this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application allows users to record their answer to an interview question, and receive analytical feedback. This feedback includes their sentiment level and number of repeated filler words used. The goal is to have a high, positive sentiment and least number of filler words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a React frontend along with a Node.js backend. We used Express to send and get HTTP requests after API calls. We used the Microsoft Cognitive Service API for their Text Analytics feature. We also used Google Chrome's Web Speech API to translate speech to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was coming up with an idea because there were so many APIs we could use. Once we figured out our idea, actually implementing the tech was another challenge. Something especially challenging we ran into was using Express to connect React to Node since none of us had much experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to overcome our technical obstacles and have a working application. The visual appeal of our frontend is also something we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of a mentor at Microsoft, we learned a lot about the Microsoft API as well as implementing Express and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VoicePrep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to add more features to VoicePrep to make it a more realistic and easily-conducted interview simulation. Some features could include keeping track of answer fluidity or adding physical posture and eye contact detectors.
