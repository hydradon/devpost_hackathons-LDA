                    The only inspiration I remember is having no projects done 4 hrs before the submission deadline.

                    The project is a slash command for the Mixmax Gmail extension. It is a add on to your email which provides the best worst puns that are under the sun (Okay this is getting out of hand, I guess I'll run or I'll get shunned.) This feature has been made with extreme dedication for you to share puns with your loved ones.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started this hackathon with two more team members, basically we were
                    <strong>
                        WERE
                    </strong>
                    a team of three. This project started 4 hours before the submission time after 4 failed projects, 2 lost arms (team members) and 1 broken soul (you guessed it, it's
                    <strong>
                        ME
                    </strong>
                    ). I started coding while experienceing hallucinations 6 am in the morning having had no sleep for a long time. God knows how I built it.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges include but are not limited to having virtually no experience building anything using Javascript, losing team members and making sure I don't loose my cool(which I know I won't this easily).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of achievements that I am really proud of. I believe the biggest being that I end this hackathon in high spirits having learnt a whole range of stuff and poking with different opportunities that I wouldn't have done on a given day. During the course of the event I am glad that I did not lose hope and kept working on something or the other, which helped me explore different domains.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    To take the positives out of this experience and learn from the mistakes and the occasional miscalculations.
AND also to  keep on learning.
