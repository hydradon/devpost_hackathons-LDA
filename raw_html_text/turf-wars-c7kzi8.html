                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this game was primarily from Splatoon and another Roblox game called Doomspire's Brickbattles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turf Wars has two teams, 10 players max on each team. The map is split up into 22 different sections called Turfs where teams present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Roblox Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were just amateurs and still learning, we ran into many syntax and logical errors in Lua.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our creative map design along with our unique turf capturing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about GUI's and new Roblox libraries, services and features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Turf Wars
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to get a second map built along with fixing all the most important bugs. We want to add more weapons to Turf wars along with more features.
