                    There's hardly an election cycle in Nigeria without reports of blatant attempts of voter fraud. A very common example is under-aged individuals queuing up to vote. Such cases are usually resolved by election officials however, it takes a lot of time and resources to get to that point especially if voting centres are busy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we could use image recognition technology to "scan" people on election day at voting centres to identify potential ineligible voters very rapidly? This will help reduce the amount of human effort to perform these checks which will lead to a smoother and faster voting process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using AI and facial recognition, we are able to detect all sorts of features from people's photos including: gender, age and even mood. If we can combine this with image data already present on voter registration records, it should be possible to automate verification and greatly speed up the job of identifying fraudulent voters.
