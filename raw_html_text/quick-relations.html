                    The outside QR pattern quickly takes those who scan it to the wearer's programmed site, be it Facebook for social media connections or a personal website for those who want business advertisements. On the inside, the second QR code is specifically for the wearer, where personal stylists from Quick Relations handpick outfits from the wearer's closet that compliment the QR garment. This way, the wearer can simply scan the inside code to find style combinations and suggestions professionally picked by a stylist.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generated two separate QR codes. The outside code was incorporated into a digital pattern using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and printed using the digital printer in the TechStyle lab. The inside code would be printed as a tag. We then created a pattern, cut the fabric and sewed the garment.

                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate with the TechStyle lab in order to print a personalized digital pattern. We also learned to create QR codes.
