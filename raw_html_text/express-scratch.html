                <p>
                    Earn's SaverLife helps 100,000 users get into an habit of saving. Households with just $250 - $749 in savings are less likely to be evicted, miss a housing or utilities payment and receive public benefits. What makes this problem very challenge is that it involves changing human behavior. However, this is important problem for our society to solve if we wish to alleviate poverty and situation that force people to become homeless.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Express Node JS framework to build out the solution. We have hosted our solution on Heroku cloud and use mlab.com to store our mongo DB. We integrated with Paypal for payment and Gyft to auto generate digital gift cards in real time.

                    <p>
                        How to distribute the winners uniformly across the time period of the contest?
How to build capabilities to fight fraud and abuse? 
What options can we provide for winners to redeem their reward? 
Paypal payout api documentation appears to be out of date. Thanks Vishal (from Paypal) for helping us out!
