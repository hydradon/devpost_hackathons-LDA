                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With so much questioning towards media validity today, how can you know what is factual news and what is bogus? From this, we derived that a user rating system would be very helpful to both news readers and journalists, who want to know what their readers think about their articles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this extension is to give users a place to state their opinion of news articles, as well as give feedback for journalists who have their articles reviewed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Visual Studio, Notepad++, and other text editors to write the code, as well as internet resources for help with code. We used the browser extension API for portability of the product, as well as ease of creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a database for the extension in Java that was incompatible with our Javascript/HTML extension, so we had to scrap our cloud database idea. We also wanted to create a website for the extension, but ran into several issues before finally scrapping that idea.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a visually and hypothetically pleasing project, as well as the learning experience of doing something we've never done (browser extension).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our proficiency with Javascript and HTML, as well as learned how to create a browser extension.
