                    We had an epiphany for questions to be answered, debated and talked about live instead of waiting for someone to post. A live chat lets people talk directly and share their views in a more clear manner and also will help them understand and broaden their horizons by hearing the views of others. We used Java to prototype the app, and the JavaFX graphics library for a GUI and Kryonet for allowing networking and exchanging of packets. The packeting system was challenging as creating one packet resulted on another packet being sent.

                    ChatAboutIt will in the future go on to proper development hopefully.
