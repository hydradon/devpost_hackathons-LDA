                </h2>
                <p>
                    machine learning is super cool and i wanted to learn more about reinforcement learning
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it uses tensorflow to train a neural network through reinforcement in openai gym's atari breakout environment.

                    My laptop doesn't have enough computer power to calculate gradients for 10800 by 1024 tensors. So I've been trying to use Amazon Web Services to make it speedier
