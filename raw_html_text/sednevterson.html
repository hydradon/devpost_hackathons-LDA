                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognized the value Abilify MyCite can contribute to treatment adherence for patients who can become unreliable when their mental health decompensates. Reflecting on the tracking technology and the significant harm being caused by the opioid epidemic in our country, we realized that the technology could be leveraged to support patients who are prescribed opioids for pain management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Justification
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While Prescription Drug Monitoring Databases aim to reduce overflow of prescriptions on the supply side, it can also serve to criminalize. The opioid epidemic is multifaceted and the intervention response must be multipronged as well. Adapting the sensor technology to this population with OpiSafe, we can address multiple factors that put people at-risk for experiencing negative outcomes, anywhere along the spectrum from misuse to overdose. Tracking ingestion can serve as a barrier for individuals to engage in illegal or unhealthy behaviors in addition to aggregating anonymized patient data around where and when prescription medication is typically abused. Further, OpiSafe supports better coordination among health care professionals to ensure safe prescribing practices and tracking of drug interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prescription opiates use digital sensor technology comparable to that used in Abilify MyCite to track if medication has been ingested by patient. The pill sensors and patch have been programmed with an ID unique to the patient for which it has been prescribed, with the purpose of keeping meds going only to those prescribed. The ingestion data is transmitted to an app where it can be accessed by the patient, patient&rsquo;s physician, the patient&rsquo;s virtual caseworker, and any individuals authorized by patient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app tracks ingestion data in relation to scheduled regimen and will alert the necessary parties of the incident that medication has not been taken according to schedule. Incidents may include ingestion ahead of schedule, missing a dose, potential overdose, etc. Different levels of incident severity will alert particular parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key piece of OpiSafe is the patient's virtual caseworker, who will be the first and most frequent line of contact with the patient, receiving alerts when patients have deviated from their medication schedule. With the support of the caseworker, patients will be able to manage their pain symptoms safely and have an advocate for any adjustments that need to be made.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application has been build using ReactJS for the user interface.  This web application calls into a Node.js service which is populated by a MongoDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first, and largest, challenge that we ran into was outlining the "vertical slices" of the functionality needed to fully complete our goal and how we could structure the phases of our work to fully meet that goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase 1 (Completed) of this project includes the information and interaction a Virtual Case Worker needs to provide support for patients prescribed with ingesting opioids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase 2 (Future Development) of this project includes the information and interaction a Public Health Researcher needs to be able to analyze trending opioid data in cities and neighborhoods in order provide adequate support for the needs of specific regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase 3 (Future Development) of this project includes the ability for a physician to track mismatches between logged ingestion of an opioid against the prescription refill request of that opioid. This functionality would allow for better tracking of potential prescription sharing or selling.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical:
Our development team's personal goal of this Hackathon was to learn and use ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB in a timeboxed and collaborative environment. The project that we were able to produce with little to no previous experience with these technologies is a point of pride for our team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functional:
                    <br>
                    The solution we are submitting has potential impact on a subject that we feel strongly needs to be addressed. Without question, creating a solution that is focused on helping potential at-risk patients and neighborhoods is our largest point of pride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our earliest and most impact lesson of the weekend was to make our goals reasonable and attainable. Early Saturday morning we realized that we would not be able to complete all 3 phases of our web application and we had to adjust our focus the user we found most important, the Virtual Case Worker. Staying agile and adaptive allowed us to narrow our focus and provide a minimally viable product for this solution.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sednevterson
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Naps. After adequate rest, we would like move forward with providing the outlined Phase 2 and Phase 3 of our solution. We feel that this fully developed solution, paired with the correct technology, could have real work impact on the way that professionals handle opioid addiction prevention information.
