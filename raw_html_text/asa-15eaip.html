                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the fact that we do not see a lot of facial recognition on computers compared to its use on cellular devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses your face as a requirement to login your account, which requires pictures of you to also sign up to the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the python code that implements the recognition program and database storage as well as the front end code for the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Integrating the front end to back end.
The pop-up window for the login posed a problem and we had to get rid of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of

                <p>
                    Learning how to integrate the frontend and backend through thorough research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending requests via XMLHttprequest to backend.
Using k nearest neighbors in order to perform facial recognition.
