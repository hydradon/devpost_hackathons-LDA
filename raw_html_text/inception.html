                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 2010 film Inception by Christopher Nolan, he introduced the dream within a dream theme where the main characters had the ability to create a world representation that is so close to the reality that they couldn't tell the difference. We want to utilize the current advances in GAN training and GRUs to build a pipeline for realistic.
Recurrent Adversarial Network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our pipeline takes in parameters, like a company website or service description link, web scrapes for desired information geared toward informing the user. That data is converted to audio then we use our  CRAN GAN to generate realistic video. With this approach, we demonstrate a new technique for interactive storytelling and also provide a great help in combating fake news videos media with our model pipeline.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google colaboratory which allows us to utilize google cloud platform GPU, TPU resources, VidTIMIT Audio-Video Dataset, python, Keras, Tensor-flow, Google's speech to text API, Colab
