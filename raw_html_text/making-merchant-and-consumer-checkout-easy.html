                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get merchants to use bitcoin in my area is like explaining how the engine of the car works.  Not many people care they just want the car to work. So, I have been researching a ton of tools merchants currently use and would like to mirror the current flow of checkouts with Bitcoin to help with adoption.
