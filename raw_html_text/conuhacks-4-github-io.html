                <p>
                    We pull data from Touchtunes for the year 2018, in the form of JSON files.
We pull that data for a specific artist, or a song, then compare it to specific events during the year and look for spikes in listens.

                <p>
                    We then display all the statistics on the number of listens people would make per day and per month to see whether or not current events covered in media over the year have an effect on song/band listens.
