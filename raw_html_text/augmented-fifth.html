                <p>
                    When assessing the affordances of augmented reality, we wanted to take advantage of how sound changes temporally in a physical environment.  Our team wanted to explore character development, musical composition, and phone position to create a unique experience for many user types.  We wanted our app to appeal to children and adults, novices and experts.  Our team comes from very diverse backgrounds and brought different levels of skills to the hackathon that helped us create something better than any of us could create on our own.  Our team members included:

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created an iPad/iPhone app that allows you to place 3D characters into your physical environment.  You can interact with those characters via a sequencer to tell your characters when they should play their instrument.  At the character level, you can toggle between different chords and notations to quickly create beautiful compositions.  As you add more characters, your composition has more layers which increases the complexity and musicality of the piece.  Because the characters are locked at a physical position, as you move around the room, the balance of the instrumentation adjusts depending on how close you are to each character.  At the global level, you can change the tempo of your instruments (which also informs how fast the characters animate).  Additionally, at the global level, you can enable the randomizer which will automatically create melodies and rhythmic variation for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in three parts.  Those were character animation, synthesizer and sound design, and augmented reality tracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Character Animation
                    </strong>
                    The characters were modeled, rigged and animated in Blender, and imported to Unity3D. Each character has a distinct animation to go along with the soundscapes that the user can create.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Synthesizer and Sound Design
                    </strong>
                    For the synthesizer, we had three main scripts.  The BeatHandler was a global script, that had a delegate called BeatAction.  The tempo of game was maintained in this script, as well as calls based on the tempo.  The Synthesizer script kept track of several variables for each individual track.  For example, it instantiated how many cubes were in each synthesizer and how many individual sounds files could be called.  The CubeController script kept track of the state of each cube and maintained what color the cube should be along with whether or not that cube should play a note (and which note it should play).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        AR Tracking
                    </strong>
                    For the Augmented Reality tracking we used Apple's ARKit framework with the Unity ARKit plugin. The main challenge was tracking the discovered planes in the 3D scene and showing a square indicating to the user whether or not a model could be placed at that spot in the scene. Other considerations were creating shadows for the virtual objects and figuring out how to scale assets to appear at reasonable sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled the first night to nail down our concept, especially when trying to create modalities that benefited from being in the 3D environment.  The next day, we all collaborated to discover this final concept that takes advantage of composition in a 3D space.  We had some issues with setting the character animations to match the state of the synthesizer, especially because the animations didn't look as nice if they moved too quickly.  We solved this by simplifying the animation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're super proud of how well we were able to integrate each of the separate components on the second day of the hackathon.  The sequencer is associated with each individual character and adjusts balance in the 3D environment.  We were pleasantly surprised and impressed by Lou's ability to integrate ARKit and by the improvements he made to make the tracking work more seamlessly in our environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's a lot of fun to do a hackathon with new friends.  We learned about some of the challenges of iterating quickly while developing for Augmented Reality using ARKit and we learned from each other best practices for developing in Unity.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us are still students, so we'll get back to pset-ing while the adults will go back to the real world I guess. :)
