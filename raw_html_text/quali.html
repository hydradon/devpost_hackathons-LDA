                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very interested in using the Vinli device as well as finding interesting ways to innovate with the capabilities of the Qualcomm SnapDragon device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the technologies we've developed, a driver can use the SnapDragon device to interact with a dashboard system simply by using motion gestures. In this use-case we created a platform that simulates what an Uber driver and given them the ability to start and end a trip simply with the wave of a hand either right-to-left or left-to-right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed python scripts to parse the Vinli data from their servers, developed firmware to gather data from a groove gesture sensor through our embedded board. Pushed all these data well structured into our firebase server from which the front pulled data to display on our web based dashboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building this application was no easy task as it required multiple API integrations as well as the integration of two hardware devices both of which posed a variety of problems especially when trying to active gesture recognition on the SnapDragon device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Driving around San Francisco and getting Vinli to gather data from our vehicle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate different components and technologies together that weren't necessarily design to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quali
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate more commands that can set parameters and limits on the vehicle from real time data coming from Vinli.
