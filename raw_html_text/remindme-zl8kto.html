                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The average person can hold only 5 to 9 objects in their working memory at a time, so it comes as no surprise that many important tasks often slip the average person&rsquo;s memory. We wanted to create an accessible tool that would make remembering tasks and events easier. Through RemindMe, we can empower people of all backgrounds and abilities and make life easier for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With RemindMe, you never have to forget a thing again. RemindMe allows its users to schedule SMS reminders to be sent at a given date and time. Its simple, user-friendly interface makes RemindMe an accessible tool for all. This web application is ideal for your grandmother who needs reminders to take her medicine, a small business owner who wants to send an appointment reminder to a client, a busy student who needs reminders to go to the gym, and everyone in between. And because the application uses SMS, users can receive reminders even without a WiFi connection. Wherever you are, you can always be up to date!
