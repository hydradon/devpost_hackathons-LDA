                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's society, organizations are in constant for updated information including big data. We were interested in how this information affects real-life experiences such as Stocks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The twitter bot posts daily tweets about potentially volatile stocks based on headlines of news articles. It also directly messages subscribers about stocks they are personally interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program using Python, Mysql, Mysql lite, and various APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we encountered were deciding which language to use, figuring out which APIs would work the best with what we were trying to accomplish, and how we wanted the finished product to appear our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of are using multiple APIs, being able to adapt to unexpected problems that arose, and actually getting the project to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate the terminal/command prompt, how to use multiple and new APIs, as well as work with different programs such as git!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chuck: the stock bot!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something we would want to improve upon with our project is to notify the subscribed user when a stock they are following falls below a certain threshold.
