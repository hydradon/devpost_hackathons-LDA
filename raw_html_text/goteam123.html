                    We built a motion sensor that communicates with Twilio and relays the information to the online portal of whether the sensor was off. Once the sensor is triggered, a sound goes off and a message is displayed in Twilio console. We used the existing button code so when button is "pressed" the light sensor is triggered. When the button is not pressed, the light sensor is off.
