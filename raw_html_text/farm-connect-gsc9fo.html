                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Satellite imagery and high technology is great, but we wanted our project to take a more personal direction, allowing the people of Morocco to directly use our technology to get in touch with each other, rather than asking for help from abroad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farm Connect allows farmers in Morocco to get in contact with each other based on what climate zones they live in and what types of crops they grow. This allows farmers with similar climates and crops to share knowledge and techniques to improve each other's crop yields. You sign up, the app grabs your lat-long, and then it tells you what climate zone you are in. Once you choose what type of crops you grow, our app finds other farmers that match. Then if you see that they are doing better than you, you can ask them for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a .Net web application built with MVC, C#, AngularJS, and SQL Server. We got our data from Global Yield Gap Analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to work with such a massive amount of data given to use by the sponsors and in the end we decided on using a more simplistic approach to data analysis - limiting our scope to certain climate zones and weather station data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the personal approach that our app takes to this problem, and that it empowers Moroccans to help each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the agricultural landscape of Morocco as well as data-retrieving techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Farm Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for Farm Connect would be to build out a real infrastructure that allows messaging between farmers. It would also need to take into consideration the technological limits of farmers and how they could get access to internet possibly through public services and institutions to get in touch with other farmers.
