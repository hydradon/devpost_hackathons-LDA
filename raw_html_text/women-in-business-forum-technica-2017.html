                    In this day and age, the stigma that women can&rsquo;t be in the business fields has made many women stay away from all of the jobs in those areas. Now more than ever, women are discriminated daily in the workforce, and because of this there are very low numbers of women in business/tech than compared to men. After talking to the JP Morgan team, we were inspired to come up with a website specifically for women. We worked around the clock coding html and making a basic website, but we realized it didn&rsquo;t look as fresh and polished as we had wanted. We decided to step it up by using Wordpress to give our website a more professional look that had a great user interface that was easy to use. Women in Business can help you with a variety of problems. Not sure how to handle a new proposal? Just ask a quick question and a thread will be made. Then watch as people come together to help you find the perfect solution. Our home page of Women in Business describes our purpose in how we want to motivate and empower women to not be afraid to join the business field. Our forum contains many categories to fit your every need, including general discussions, international policies, and a special self-promotion category. Click on any one to be taken to that specific message board. As for mentorship, our mentors are working hard to help each individual by email. After making our website, we learned how by coming together and planning something, you can accomplish something great in a short amount of time. We hope our website will help women in the workforce everyday as we continue to update and better Women in Business in the future.
