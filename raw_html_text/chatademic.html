                    what really inspired me to built this system was marks drop down of secondary students in my country. i then carried a research to find what might led to this massive catastrophic isident.A quite number of percentage showed that there is no platform to connect students with each other keeping them captivated while they share necessary 
 information to upgrade their marks not loosing the main of which is moulding bright future with a education base.i also realized that nowadays most of the students are attached to social media more so that they tent to divert more attention to it than anything else.

                    Chatademic is aiming to connect students within the same school and other schools including teachers. it facilitate a well learning enviroment by giving students an opportunity to connect with others and share skills,ideas experiences to learn instead of connecting with others to socialise while not having any goal to archive that can brighten their future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the way this system is built it connect students and they will share materials with others in word or pdf format, they will be able to post and have conversation with others, motivating and inspiring each other, download shared materials by teachers , write online exams set by teachers write and upload their assignments online making it easier for them and teachers to give feedback any time.

                    challenges i came accross was not easy to overcome but i did not loose patience to deal with them. first i had a challenge with asking students their main problems on loosing focus on their studies which results in them scoring lower marks, secondly some of the functions to implement in my system i had to learn them from scratch to build a good system which gave me a headache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    with being 80% done with implementing i started doing my testing with other people. students and those who have experience in system development. i was quite impressed to receive a good feedback as they told me that i made something to help and  improve the future of the coming generation and it will forver serve its purpose as there is currently nothing similar to it which exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    im still looking forwad to improve chatademic so it can be the next big system to help students to learn more from each other.
