                <p>
                    JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions (JMWE) has been a top 5 best-selling add-on for Atlassian JIRA since its inception. For more than 6 years, it has also been successfully used by thousands of JIRA Cloud customers as a free "bundled" add-on. However, Atlassian recently made the difficult but necessary decision to remove all bundled, Java-based add-ons from JIRA Cloud, and because so many users were dependent on JMWE-powered workflows, it became obvious that a Connect version of the add-on was needed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Cloud-based, Connect API version of JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions (JMWE).
It provides a set of useful workflow post-functions that customers can use to quickly implement, without coding, sophisticated workflows in JIRA.

                <p>
                    Though JIRA offers many good features to build workflows, when customers want to automate business processes to fit the diverse needs of their teams, they often need to expand further. JMWE helps customers extend their JIRA workflows without the need to custom-develop their own post-functions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JMWE for JIRA Cloud is a complete rewrite of the Java-based add-on, using the Connect framework. It is built in JavaScript for the NodeJS platform, and takes advantage of many JavaScript libraries.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult aspect of this project was to find ways to work around the stringent limitations imposed by the Connect framework (compared to the Java API that JMWE was using). Other challenges involved scalability and robustness for a high-volume, mission-critical, multi-tenant product.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I discovered the whole new world of Atlassian Connect, and the challenges of high-volume web-based solutions.

                    What's next for JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions for JIRA Cloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innovalog is on the mission to make JIRA workflows perform best. The first version of JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions for JIRA Cloud will be published to the Atlassian MarketPlace in September. It will consist of all the features that were previously available in the Java-based add-on. In the future, we will be adding exciting new features, such as new post-functions and extensions to the existing ones in order to provide even more out-of-the-box functionalities to help JIRA administrators quickly implement sophisticated workflows to further increase the impact JIRA has on their team.
