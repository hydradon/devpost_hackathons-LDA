                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tooth Fairy was designed and built by "Eagle and Moose" - two mothers (one from the US, the other Canada) who met on Facebook but not (yet) in real life. We know how important dental care is for young children and how getting them into a healthy dental routine is a challenge. We built this Alexa Skill to make the morning and bedtime routine a bit easier.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When your children are ready to brush your teeth, they can "Open the Tooth Fairy" and listen to words of encouragement and songs while they brush, floss or mouthwash! She'll even share some facts about teeth and dental care while you floss.

                <p>
                    We used the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for node.js, supported by an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and S3 storage. With regards to 3rd party content used within our skills, the background music "Kids Piano Swing" and "Fairy Music Box Logo" was purchased at

Our music for the Brushing Song and Mouthwash Song was provided by David Vox Mullen. One of our fairies is Bobbie Briggs, the other fairy is Christine Tanner (one of the contestants).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we live in Canada and The United States respectively, we wanted to have The Tooth Fairy available in both countries. So when we developed and certified our skill, we were surprised that our skill wasn't showing up in the Canada Alexa Skills store, only the U.S. Alexa Skills store. What we didn't realize when creating the skill was that English(U.S.) and English(Canada) are considered two different languages! So we had to go back, update the skill to include the English(Canada) language, and re-submit for certification.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud to say that we have a certified Alexa Skill in the United States and in Canada! Neither of us have a background in coding, we met in an "Intro to Programming" course in 2017! We have learned so much in this past year and look forward to developing more skills in 2018!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to gather feedback to make The Tooth Fairy even more delightful for our users and their families! Ideas that we are contemplating are to create an
                    <em>
                        Easter Egg
                    </em>
                    Intent that captures when a child tells the tooth fairy that they have "lost a tooth" or to create a mini-game where the child can guess how many teeth different animals have.
