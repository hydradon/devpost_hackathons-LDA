Right now just for taking iris scans and finger print they carry 20 pounds of bulky equipment

                        I propose the solution of creating a uniform of raspberry pi all raspberry pi  being connected in a mesh network communicating on the same radio frequency. Because all computers can communicate by messaging each other via radio wave lengths we can in a sense create a cluster of computers which we can use to process information or save information in a distributed manor

                    <li>
                        First we need to verify we can send messages between two raspberry pis
send data over fm radio using raspberry pi

                        Data Transmission: Operators often have requirements to transmit large amounts of data to command elements when there is little or no communications infrastructure available. For example, they may be required to stream high definition, full-motion, real-time video or store up to 72 hours&rsquo; worth of data for later transmission. What innovative capabilities can be developed to collect, manage, and transmit data in austere environments?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        He explained to me main issue is that we have a bunch of people on ground need to be able to send live data 5, 10, or K miles away. Right now we are carrying a lot of batteries, large satellites, routers, and large computers

                        In a distributed system if I separate data and then one of my nodes that has data is lets day destroyed I have no way of getting that information back so I cant guarantee you will also have all data

                        To change this one would need set up lest say a pub sub network where one radio frequency can send a message to multiple minicomputer  and we can duplicate to guarantee probability of not losing any packets of data.
