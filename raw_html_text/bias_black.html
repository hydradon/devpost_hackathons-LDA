                    This is a prototype to display proof of concept.
The goal is to have users create and share Bias polls surrounding any topic and have the dynamic results displayed throughout social media through the use of a banner. Viewers can instantly see the results while scrolling their own social feeds and can decide to participate, share further, and create their own.
