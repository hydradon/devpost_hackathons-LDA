                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a map-related project in order to compete in the HERE.com challenge, and we thought it might be cool for people to see notes in augmented reality to be able to relate a note with a physical location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    mpost allows users to make posts on a map by pressing a button. The user then drops a marker on the map at their current location, which they can tap to view their post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Android Studio, using the Google Maps SDK for Android to display the map, drop the markers, and add info windows.  We also used the Facebook Login API to allow users to log in and Facebook Graph API to get user information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was that we originally tried to use the HERE.com mapping API, but we very lately found that the modules we needed were premium and we were poor.  Hence we decided to switch to the Google Maps API.  After that, we had trouble adding posts and markers together since android activities were strictly separate. We resolved this by making the markers under the post activity and adding posts to a data structure, generating the markers with posts attached when the map is generated.

                <p>
                    We are proud of learning how to use Android Studio and the Facebook Login API.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is important to thoroughly research an API before committing to using it to build a project.

                    What's next for mpost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to fix a few bugs and implement some more features, including: 
-Allowing users to post directly to Facebook from the app
-AR mode for people to see notes in augmented reality
-Use of database to be multi-user 
-Post filters and searches so users can specify what posts they want to see
