                    The current control systems used in the greenhouse are Bluelab Dosetronic CropKing Controller, which is a closed system with no means to monitor the system remotely. Apart from them, provide data to the user using a proprietary data cable, which costs $600. These systems work on timers and without any means for monitoring it remotely.

                <p>
                    We are using an array of Smart IoT devices and sensors which capture the Hydroponic systems status and relays it to a gateway (a raspberry-pi/ a network hub), which then connects to an instance in the Cloud to store these parameters in a database. This data can be analyzed by the user and can be viewed in real-time.

                    The challenge we faced was in understanding the currently installed system at the greenhouse, as this is different from the conventional irrigation and agricultural techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we proposed an architecture for monitoring and automatic control of these systems and integrated with the existing control systems at the greenhouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we provided a proof of concept for the proposed system and web application through a presentation at Patriothacks 2019 hackathon, which was awarded as the "Best Overall" among the projects presented.
