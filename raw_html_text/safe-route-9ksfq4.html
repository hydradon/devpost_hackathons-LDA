                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been uncomfortable with the idea of walking to your destination - in a new city, late at night, or when you're alone? Often, the shortest path can take you through some uncomfortable areas that you would rather avoid, ever if it meant a slightly longer trek to get to your destination. Safe Route looks for the best route, so you can feel more secure in your commute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safe Route optimizes based on the overall safety of a given path, rather than always choosing the route that is the shortest distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps, Google Places, and Crimemapping.com APIs to generate initial possible routes and then recommend routes that were safer based on open businesses and crime data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining the open business data and crime data with the routes suggested by Google was more challenging than we initially expected. We also had a lot of debates about the components of the safety score and what factors should be included.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we got safety routes based on open data working, we were excited to see that it reflected what we expected based on our intuition of what routes would be safer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting with a clear vision of what we wanted the app to achieve helped us focus on the best APIs available to realize the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safe Route
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are more optimizations we'd like to do to the safest route algorithm, to differentiate between different open establishments, incorporate a penalty for dead blocks, and add a social component so people using the app can improve the experience for everyone.
