                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had long realized that normal morning alarms just didn't cut it with the constant flux in the TTC travel times. Whether it's construction, holidays or even the day of the week, more often than not we'd end up getting up at a regular time but still getting caught in an unexpected delay. Alternatively, we'd loose precious sleep getting up early, only find that there's less traffic that day. We devised an app that would take the guesswork out by using the accurate predictions and historical data of Google Maps to dynamically adjust your wake-up alarms.

                    Alaram uses the accurate predictions and historical data of the Google Maps API to dynamically adjust your wake-up alarms and improve both your sleep and your commute.

                    We used Xamarin.Android with Visual C# in Visual Studio to create the app and implement the APIs.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was that Google Maps API knows how calculate arrival time from a departure time, but not vice-versa. We solved this by working backwards in increments, based on an

                    Our main skepticism going in was our ability to implement API's, and we are proud of how we were able to complete the task.
