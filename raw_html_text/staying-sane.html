                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was considering how stressful Hackathon might be for some people when I realized that some of it was probably just me and my anxiety. Then I thought about how many people don't know whether or not the have anxiety. I thought about making a diagnosis analysis for just anxiety, but a TON of research later and I though why not do the top four. I also thought that this fit with the theme of this year's Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall the program is text based and begins with a short introduction and then goes on to a few facts about mental health struggles that students face today. After that it runs through a series of questions based of the DSM V's new arterial for the diagnosis of the top four mental illness young adults are diagnosed with. In the end it tells you whether or not you meet the basic requirements for a diagnosis and the provides resources for you based on which you met and which you didn't. The very end is KU's Counseling and Psychology Services information and a short sign off.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is in C++ Linux Ubuntu. It is a LOT of if else statements and text blocks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally I had all of my declarations as strings, but ran into trouble when compiling the final diagnosis. The if else statements got very mad at boolean strings. So rather than prompting for a 'Yes' or 'No'  response I had to go back and change all of my user prompts to '1' for yes and '0' for no.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't actually start working on it until Saturday evening with about 14 hours left. I am proud of how quickly I worked with so much typing. As well as that I was able to debugger and complete it entirely on my own.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent a good 5 hours reading up on strings and very new for me: I had no idea was 'getline' was. I am so excited to be able to use it to take in whole lines now!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Staying Sane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No idea. Honestly hopefully a web page rather than a terminal prompted text informational. I might be able to expand it to a far greater number of diagnosis as well. That would be pretty cool.
