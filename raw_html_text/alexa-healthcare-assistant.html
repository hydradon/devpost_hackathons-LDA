                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many seeking aid with mental health problems, the difficulty lies in scheduling an initial appointment. Major clinics can end up being booked for months, while smaller clinics or independent therapists may be overlooked or difficult to find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Healthcare Assistant enables home users to find open therapists in their area and schedule an appointment with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Healthcare Assistant uses the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda Functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into critical bugs with both methods of creating Google Calendar Events through the Calendar API, so I was unable to integrate calendar scheduling with the current version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I used any of the technology involved in this hack (Amazon Alexa, Lambda Functions, Node.js, AWS).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VUI design, building an Alexa Skill, setting up a Node.js deployment package and connecting it with AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Healthcare Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next major steps for Alexa Healthcare Assistant are providing an interface for therapists to submit information to the database and integrating patient and provider calendars.
