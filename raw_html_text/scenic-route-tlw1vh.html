                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been on a long road trip with little kids? It's always a mess. The kids get bored and cramped and annoyed, and they mood leads to the parents being angry and irritated and stressed. We wanted to build an app that could keep the little ones engaged yet be educational in a thoughtful way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A child-friendly educational app that engages children during long road trips or travels with information and activities, about places they are going to or are around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Swift and Figma
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had previous or significant experience with app development or using APIs, so using swift with the Google Maps API was a learning curve for us. Implementing the Google Map API was particularly challenging with swift as the documentation is not optimal. We weren't able to properly link a marker or a button to lead away from the map screen because the documentation for that action was very little online and the few options suggested were all not working due to a variety of reasons such as newer version of swift etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly we are proud of generating such an amazing idea. Also everyone had to work with a something completely new skillset and we're proud of the new things we have learnt this weekend.
Moreover for most of us (3 out of 4), this was our first hackathon experience, and we're proud of all we have accomplished within the hackathon, and this has inspired us to go to more in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use Swift, Google Maps API, sketch and html and css.
                </p>

                    What's next for Scenic Route
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond some fixes such as making the markers clickable and adding more locations to the app, we have a lot of features to expand upon. One of the great things about our idea is that it has immense room for more features to better experience for the users. Some of these features are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Being able to view your entire trip and remaining time for travel
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having access to a history of your previous trips and the landmarks viewed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Earning badges for using different features of the app and interacting with it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding an option to detour to a landmark if the parents have time and are interested (in such case we would also like to be able to pair the parents device with the kid's to display the map)
                    </li>
                </ul>
