                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project design was inspired by the theme of the Cutie Hack website, with our main character being a turtle named Ralph.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile game allows players to control a turtle and navigate their way through a trash-filled beach, collecting jellyfish along the way. The goal is to return to the ocean, but the more jellyfish you collect, the higher your score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio as our basis for building the app, and implemented an API that gave us access to the device's gyroscope. This allowed us to build our game's controls based on the physical movement of the device. We also used completely original art assets for our game, all drawn by one of our team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using android studio was a challenge in and of itself because only one of us had any development experience with it. On top of that, Android Studio doesn't give error codes a lot of the time which made debugging extremely tedious. We had several out of bounds errors that caused crashes as well as certain objects that were coded identically but functioned differently, causing crashes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome the challenges that came with using Android Studio, the first time for most of our team. Despite the frustrations of trying to fix code that was visibly identical, but functioned differently for unknown reasons, we stuck with our idea and found solutions to the problems we faced. All of our team members were able to contribute equally to the project and we are all proud of what we accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with APIs and Android Studio. We also improved our debugging skills and learned how to stay dedicated to solving problems.
