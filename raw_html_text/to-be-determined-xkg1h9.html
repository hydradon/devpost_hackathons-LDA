                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get inspired by stories of small entrepreneurs in poor countries that struggles with the financial system. 
They don't have access to regular credit's offers from banks, and usurers charges them with high rates.
Their only choice is to request for micro-credit but this quite new financial offer is not yet well regulated and need new solutions coming to the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is based on the "tontine" system : credit are shared between several entrepeneurs that stand together to reimburse. The default risk can increase but they get lowest interest rate and get the insurance to be backuped if they are not able to pay.
Money comes from personal lenders who wants to combine savings and solidarity...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a mobile app with an interface where entrepreneurs are able to connect, ask for loans and follow their paiements.
Combine with an app where lenders can follow and manage their savings.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find the business model to improve the solution (lenders are banks or personal lenders, ...)
Determine the APIs to be used, how to use them ...
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to work together, people from differents horizons (finastra people and externs). And we were able to deliver a UI prototype for the demo.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of interesting keys and informations about micro-finance....

                    What's next for Positiv'Invest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of idea to develop Positiv'Invest. 
First of all, of course, is to build a real app that can be use everywhere in the world.
Then we came with some improvements, like using machine learning to improve the algorithm that will create loans pool, and compution of scoring.
We also thought about adding advice services for the entrepreneurs based on the loans they already contracts throw Positiv'Invest.
For the lenders part, we thought about adding news flows about entrepeneurs that were able to grow they business thanks to Positiv'Invest.
