                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always see lost dogs on the street, and hate feeling helpless about not doing anything. One of the group members has lost a pet before, and it felt like losing a family member. Helping people get reunited with their pets is something we think can make a large number of people's lives better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can upload a picture of a dog you've seen along with a location and that data gets saved into our SQL database. Owners who are looking for dogs can use our google maps display to view all the pins that have been posted and look for their dog.
                </p>
