                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For those times when Mudge Wi-Fi doesn't work and you have a hackathon with a deadline in two hours and you have to share code with each other. Also for those times when the Wi-Fi is down and you want to complain in silence to your friend but then you remember the Wi-Fi is down so you can't use messenger (and you don't have text or data because you're cheap)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sender transfers images and text by converting it to frequencies (inaudible to humans so that it doesn't annoy your roommate when you're working on homework at 2 am), and then the receiver processes the frequencies heard and compiles an image/text file (depending on what was sent) based upon it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    crying, a lot. really
We also sold our soul to the devil to plot a spectrogram.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all seriousness, we started by analyzing the image for the light value of each pixel, and then converting each of these pixels into a certain frequency. We then read through the array of frequencies and play it. The receiver records the audio and then translates it back to pixels/ascii
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran (Fast) into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fourier. Transform. Tkinter also really doesn't like working with matlab, and tended to cause a lot of issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work. We were able to put into practice what we learnt about signal processing, and also created filters and a lot of plots. We were about to get around issues of compatibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implements aspects of signal processing that we were not familiar with, such as sound processing, and generating wav files
We lewant about image manioulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Si-fi (like Wi-fi but with sound):
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a proof of concept, in that we are able to transfer images with a certain degree of accuracy. Sci-fi is also capable sending other kinds of files, such as tect files, videos etc.
