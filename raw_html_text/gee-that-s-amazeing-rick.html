                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1st episode of the 3rd Rick and Morty season, we sadly had to see how hundreds of Mortys where anniquilated by Rick C-137. We wanted to bring back to life some of those Mortys.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two stages in our game. The first consists on a set of questions that will tell you which Morty is best suited to your personality. After that, without knowing which Morty you are yet, you are invited to solve a funny maze that will throw light on the results of the previous poll.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The questions are part of an html form that are then processed in php. Thus, the logic of the "which Morty you are" part is done in php. Finally, the maze is built in javascript.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to deal with lots of difficulties, such as creating the maze and its random.
