                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public TTS services are not so good. We couldn't find big public data sets to train state-of-the-art algorithms. Aspects of Google Voice are trained on 1900 hours of private data. Power to the people!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses YouTube and handmade Closed Captions to create audio snippets with correct English text.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Google YouTube API, PyDub
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python's type safety, python in general, lack of video decoder capabilities on lab machines, sleep, annoying people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    running and easy to use product, 7000 sentences with audio snippet and accurate English text.after just 3 hours of running (on one slow ass machine).

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google API is powerful, this is actually totally possible
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    DRAIN YOUTUBE!! Minor post-processing of the data, error evaluation, build a huge data set and publish it, expand to audio books (highly illegal) and movies (even more highly illegal) and other languages (totally possible as well)
