                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that had the potential to be the next Pokemon Go.  We also wanted to get people outside and exercising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile web app that anyone with a smart phone can use.  There is no download required.  The app uses your phone's GPS technology to pinpoint your location.  Race against others to capture nodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coded in html and javascript.  Used Heroku to host our domain.  Used AWS to host our database.  We also used frameworks such as:  node.js, bootstrap, and mongodb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Wanted to use Pebble watches but they didn't have GPS or wifi
-Didn't know the first thing about webdev.
-Hard to learn about all the different technologies required to build this app
-Lots of work to split between 2 members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Following through on our unique idea that we had no idea how we were going to implement
-Working as a team with goals and coming up with a thorough plan to accomplish them
-Pushing through the tough times of the development and never losing sight of our goals!
-Having a lot of fun and making the most of our time here (connecting and making friends)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Lots and lots about webdev and all that is related
-Leadership and teamwork
-Hardwork and perseverance pays off!
                </p>

                    What's next for NodePatrol
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Hopefully develop it into a complete game!  We were also thinking of how cool it would be to make a bonus infection-style game with the same technology.
