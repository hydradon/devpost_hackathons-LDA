                    We have decided to go with the 2nd case - creating an app aimed at the caretakers that would help them understand and provide better care to their patients. Our persona is Anne Steenhuis, a 73 year old woman with a mild stage of Alzheimer&rsquo;s living in Borne. She has three kids and a pet dog Snuffel.

                    The goal of our project is to demonstrate what living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s is like - simple things become complicated, spatial orientation becomes increasingly hard and the natural flow of time is disrupted. The game takes place in an apartment where the player has to follow through a daily schedule - eating, cleaning, feeding the dog, etc. Doing so successfully rewards the player with a sense of competence, while failing to carry out the tasks introduces static noise to simulate confusion and the sense of uneasiness.
