                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decision making for water rationing should take into account not only water resources and usage, but also the the social well-being and the vulnerability of populations. We want to develop a visualization tool that would allow to take all sorts of variable into consideration.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our visualization tool provides a multidimensional view of the water scarcity problem in California. It includes variables related to the hydroclimatic and drought impacts, the socioeconomic context and water consumption in about 400 California cities. The multidimensional view combined with the map visualization makes the tool interactive and optimized for the design of water rationing policies in a more equitable manner.
