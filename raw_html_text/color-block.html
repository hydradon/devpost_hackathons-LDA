                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Edison found 1000 ways to not create a light bulb. We&rsquo;ve created thousands of ways to wear your cargo and denim. We love colors, we love fashion, and we love programing.  Everyone wants to look good, but many people are unsure where to start, or are too nervous to ask for a quick second opinion on the fly. We have all had the moment in our lives where we wanted to come out of our shell and step up our dressing game, whether it would be in college or in the workplace, fashion can be extremely intimidating. Asking for on the go dynamic advice can at times be difficult or embarrassing; most especially for those less in tune with their fashionable side. What we wanted was to create an app that has accessibility to everyone.  Our goal is to base our advice on the basics of what looks appealing, rather than prodding the consumer with the latest avant-garde fashion. We don't want people to buy new clothes, we want them to love what they already have; as such we took a different approach. We mathematically provide advice on what colors work with other colors, by comparing the contrast between the two. A dynamic formula that can withstand the fickle fashion industry.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color Block captures the colors of your outfit and displays them beside your picture to show how color is the true key player in an outfit. People now have the ability to improve their outfit by utilizing proper color contrasting, a simple yet basic approach.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, we created Color Block in Java with API that could fit our needs within the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use APIs proved to be much more difficult than we had anticipated. Our implementation of the APIs took a large amount of trial, error and troubleshooting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning how to code was another step in the journey. We learned new techniques and new implementations on how to integrate certain features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering how the app will run and its uses. We would visualize in our head what the app would look like and how it would run. We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create the perfect app in a short amount of time, but we managed to code and add the main features of the body.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was looking sisyphean and we believed the project would be a wash. However, two team members managed to bring life back to our project by spending hours working on the most important parts of the project, until they finally cleared the hurdle.
This is our first time all doing hack and even though we faced tribulations, we created a project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is not as easy as you would like to believe, especially implementing APIs.
Time is precious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Color Block
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the features for extracting colors. Color extraction will take colors from photos taken in the app. (Apply a color extractor to camera.)
Flash on Camera.
Photos taken will ignore the colors from background.
