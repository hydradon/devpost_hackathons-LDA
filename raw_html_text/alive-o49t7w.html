                    My journey began with a desired to prove that trauma can be the catalyst for an enhanced state of being. With first hand experience of this I decided to use the most powerful tool I know to collect and tell the true stories of others that not only proved my but assisted my theory. It was an intensely powerful journey for me, culminating in a deep understanding of what I just learned this weekend are called Mirror Neurons: Witnessing in realtime an honest emotional release moving through the audiences as the stories played out, and going into detail over conversations post performances; I had accidentally opened the door to a world I&rsquo;d unknowingly been longing for my whole life.

                    Many synchronistic events later and I find myself moving deep into the world of Functional Music clawing at the gates of multi-sensory integration.

                    After spending the last decade focused on telling other peoples stories I have been dragged kicking and screaming back to my own reality. At only 2years old my nephew, Milo was diagnosed with a terminal illness. With an unknown prognosis this news uncontrollably sparked my very own Mirror Neurons. Forced back into the story of watching him, just as we did my dad 2 decades ago, slowly lose his ability to be alive.

                    After a year of silence I finally sat myself down to move through this current reality with music. And as I allowed myself to sing out my inner state I moved from death, into grief and I found myself once again&hellip; alive!

                    This weekend has been a huge leap forward in my understanding and direction for this project. 
Beginning from a place of earthly elements I now realise that Death, Grief and Life are the three main states of being that connect us to our own reality. I want to use music to understand my own internal reality and in turn use that to allow others to understand theirs. There are many layers to the concept working with elements, colours and mind states to incorporate some actual research, data and ancient techniques into my processes. I will be predominantly using the Mi.Mu Gloves to navigate this space and all the postures I will be using are a language in their own right: I have teamed up with VoiceSign; A brand new language, still being formed that allows mute people to sign in full sentences just as they hear and think. My aim is for each element to be another layer of communication to create an inclusive experience that can be journeyed through by anyone.
