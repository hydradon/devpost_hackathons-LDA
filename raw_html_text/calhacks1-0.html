This is a game that can be played with up to as many friends as you want. Create a game and print out QR codes and enter the values used for the QR codes into the app to add players. Then hit start game and try to take a picture of each others QR codes before someone takes one of yours. This was an idea originally from Andrew Zhang as the project lead. All of the team members faced challenges of their own as we were all first-time hackathon members with limited coding experience. We faced a lot of challenges along the way. The major one was trying to determine what pieces of technology we should implement to bring our idea to life. The technology ended up being an Android app front end, connected to a Google App Engine server interacting with Google Firestore data storage. Unfortunately, we were unable to complete this project within 36 hours. We will however try and finish this on our own time after the hackathon is over. This has been a tremendous joy to work on and we are all looking forward to our next hackathons.
