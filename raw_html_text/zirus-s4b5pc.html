                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We think public transport situations can be optimalized for best social user experience.
                    </strong>
                    What if you could be able to connect the storyteller to the vlogger, and the venture capitalist to the entrepreneur? Our aim is simply to bring the world closer together, and provide AI to make the best UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zirus uses AI to match you with people with similar interest on public transport. Users take a short and interactive survey that can be integrated into ex. an airline website, and this survey allows Zirus to find the best match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a variation of KNN and a CNN, allowing them to combine and work to help one another. Our system was able to create an N-dimesional graph and use Euclidian distance to measure the best match between users. Our AI also learns how to weigh the questions differently based on user's reviews that are taken after using Zirus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs, bugs, and bugs. Aaand implementing the AI-system. If only we had more time, we had so many plans. Good thing the hackathon isn't the end all be all of our program's life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to write two AIs without the use of a third party, while creating a frontend that is both interactive and focuses on UX/UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement an AI system and using chatbots for frontend. We also learned how to implement graphics, although we were an hour short on beautiful visitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zirus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to revolutionise the social "situation" in planes, and long-distance busses and trains. We aim for people to create meaningful connections!
