                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trump's tweet about Lockheed-Martin cuts $4 billion in value. Musk's $420 price per share announcement cost 11% shaved off of Tesla's price. Studies have demonstrated Twitter chatter strongly correlates with short-term stock market activity. When combined with sentiment-based trading methods, Twitter analysis may be a powerful tool for successful day-traders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter Trader is a powerful real-time natural language processing application that we&rsquo;ve designed to scrape Twitter for the sentiment from politicians, executives, and the media that could affect short-term equity prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter API, Stock API, NLP Library, pandas.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we had a group of four, two of our group members were more business oriented so a lot of the coding was done by two people, while the other two directed the path of our coding as well as working on the presentation/logo. It was our first time trying to implement RESTful APIs, as well as the email automation through a python script that made us hit major roadblocks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times we were uncertain if we could get through the roadblocks we encountered. However, we were able to get a working product within the short amount of time with more implementations with stock info and email automation included. We really believe our idea is innovative and it was a great learning experience.
