                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often we want to go out to eat with our friends and we don't know what to eat! Having to consider everyone's tastes and preferences as well as dislikes and religious preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An iOS app contains a login page with a webview to a bootstrap site that contains adding and editing groups with invite capabilities. This site is hosted on a server with a MySQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It wasn't easy being able to create algorithms that determine the best matches for a group. Sending requests via an iOS app to determine the status of the page with only a webview was an obvious challenge as well. This however enables cross-platform capability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to to successfully implement the algorithms as well as enable native iOS login credentials, so that the webview stays logged in even if the user quits the app, until he or she decides to log out.
