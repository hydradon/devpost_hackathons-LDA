                    i was supposed to take 2 hours from square one. unfortunately i am stupid and missed the bus so i had to wait an extra hour. my commute getting here was 3 hrs and ~15 minutes. When i go back i will have to commute 2 hours. It also takes 15 minutes for me to get to square one from my house, adding 30 minutes for a grand total of 5.5 hours. Since i got here around 11, I will have commuted 5 hrs 30 mins for about 8 hours of hackathon. still worth it
