                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired after waiting in line for thirty minutes at a boba store. I thought that it would be a great idea if I could make an app that functioned similarly to Google Maps or Waze, noting the traffic of food stores.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a user-dependent app that asks a user to input whether a restaurant is busy or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app through the use of the Yelp API, using information given by Yelp's Fusion API to retrieve information of businesses. Through the Search View Controller, users would enter in what type of food they want, bringing them to the Businesses View Controller, which displayed a table view of businesses based on the term inputted in the search. By pressing on a single business, it would bring users to a screen of the singular business with an option to determine whether the store was busy or not. Through the use of Firebase, I was able to make branches of the businesses along with sub-branches that determined whether it was busy and the date in which the input was made.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into were fixing constraints and making sure the UI looked as clean as possible. One of the main challenges was the implementation of the Yelp API and retrieving the access token to legally retrieve data from the JSON from Yelp.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing I am especially proud of is my UI. I put in a lot of effort and thought into creating a clean UI that will leave a good impression on the users.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to manage and organize my time through helpers such as the App Design Document. I also learned new topics I never learned about such as closures and JSON and was able to build a foundation for my future coding career.
                </p>

                    What's next for Line Eater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on setting pre-set data and maybe collaborating with certain restaurants on getting data considering my app is dependent on users and user interaction. I also plan on specifying my app, implementing an exact number of checkins as compared to just asking whether the restaurant is busy or not.
