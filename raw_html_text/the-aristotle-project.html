                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop &hellip; When this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment,&rdquo; a quote from Monica Lewinsky&rsquo;s recent TED Talk The Price of Shame that retriggered her social bashing from previous past events. However, a recent blog states that when all the toxic comments were deleted, the opinion of the public also shifted where people started to encourage and support Monica Lewinsky and her TED Talk. After reading this blog, this inspired us to create a tool to fight cyber-bullying called &ldquo;Project Aristotle&rdquo;.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a twitter bot using Twitter API and Indico API that targets mean tweets directed to individuals and exposes its negativity by retweeting, so that people are encouraged to reply with positive feedback
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Indico IO crashed many times because too many people at HackPrinceton were using the API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one on our team was ever exposed to Python before, but we set our minds to code the project entirely in Python and we managed to pick up the language overnight
                </p>

                    What I learned

                    Python, web services, twitter API, machine learning, data scraping

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to expand this project for such platforms as Youtube, Facebook etc.
