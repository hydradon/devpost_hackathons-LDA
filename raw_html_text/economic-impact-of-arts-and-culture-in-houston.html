                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was very much inspired by the topic as soon as I saw it on the hackathon's list of projects. It can help uncover some numbers that will be very valuable for the growth of Houston's economy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at some of the published economic impact reports. We improved our presentation significantly compared to the existing reports. We introduced interactivity and instant feedback as new features for the reports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data Modelling was very difficult for the task. It was very difficult to establish direct correlation between numbers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    The end product
Time I took to deliver it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about teams and good amount of JQuery !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Economic impact of  Arts and Culture in Houston
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are willing to work with City to better their reports. Our reports include Tableau based interactive charts. City of Houston already has performance based dashboards using Tableau. So it will be very quick and easy to produce an interactive report like this with no significant additional cost.
