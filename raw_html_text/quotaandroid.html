                    NOTE: If master branch seems incomplete, go to Noah branch. Attempted to make the branch the master, but unsure if it worked correctly. The Noah branch has the most updated version.

                    Quota is a typical to-do list app for rather forgetful people; the user creates an account (with email and password),
which connects to Firebase. Then the user can add tasks to their list and remove them as he or she
completes them.

                    INCOMPLETE FEATURES:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firebase integration: 
The tasks are not saved or loaded to or from the Firebase database right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saving any kind of data: As of right now the data stored in the app is temporary, that is when the user
closes the app, the tasks will not save. Obviously this makes the app nearly useless, but that will
be coming in future versions.
