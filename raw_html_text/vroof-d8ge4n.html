                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this game was the idea that we can have the convenience of owning an animal in your homes. With this game itself, it could teach responsibility to users on how to take care and meet the basic needs of an animal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a virtual dog in which the user is able to interact with as well as interact with their environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Blender to develop and edit the models, and used Unity as a platform to develop the virtual environment. We used Visual Studio to create scripts in order to interact with the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we ran into was emulating hands in a virtual environment, adding user input to react to the Pet and the users surroundings, and writing the script to add animations to the pet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to finish a product which is able to provide the user with an interactive pet. Also, we are proud of being able to self teach ourselves unity within 24 hours in order to create a final product.

                <p>
                    We learned to self teach ourselves unity within 24 hours in order to create a VR game/simulation.

                    What's next for Vroof
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to allow the user to choose what and how many pets he/she wants to add in the simulation.

                <p>
                    Our project for Hack TCNJ 2019 was a virtual reality game with a dog name Miku.
