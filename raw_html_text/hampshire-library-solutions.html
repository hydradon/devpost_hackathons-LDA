                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just thought it would be a fun and challenging project to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to navigate easily through the library without getting lost and it makes it easy to find books.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used MIT App Inventor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MIT App Inventor has many limitations. While loops do not work, databases are buggy, and app sizes are extremely limited. In fact, I had to create two apps because of App Inventors limitation, however, the second one is relatively small. I wasn't able to properly add all of the directions/hours to locations around the library due to the volume of the app. I also couldn't import the entire database of books (around 150,000 books). This made it impossible for me to check if the book was actually within the main stack or one of the other smaller stacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other difficulties I faced was at first being unable to properly sort into the stacks because they had a combination of letters and numbers. I got around this by only dealing with the first consecutive set of letters, and the next consecutive set of numbers. This worked for almost all of the books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to make the sort work in the end. It took the entire night and morning. I was slo very engaged during the entire time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy being creative with hardware. I had never done any kind of hardware hack and it was the first time I was the one to design the software hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hampshire Library Solutions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to implement this into Android Studio or something so that I have no app size limitation. I also need to implement my second app into my first app because of the size limitations. I also want to add a better QR code scanner. There is only 1 option for QR code scanners in the App Inventor.
