                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We conceived the idea of Screener Focus out of the desire to learn and use computer vision and machine learning APIs. We also had an interest in ways that people could be more interactive and social while consuming media, whether that be Youtube videos or full-length movies. While completing this project, we learned a lot about how web applications are made, from front to back. Coming from different backgrounds, we all had things to contribute as a team, allowing us to learn and share with each other.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our product through a combined effort of our front and backend teams. Some of us focused on building a solid video player that could take pictures at appropriate times, while others worked on designing the website itself. The backend team worked on making API calls to Google Vision as well as creating routes that allowed easy access to our user and video data. The final aspect we worked on was the visualization and allowing users to look at the data after watching a video.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we faced included the difficulty of deploying a product in a short amount of time with limited preparation. Initially, we were perhaps too focused on wanting to start, and not enough on planning as a team. This led to problems down the line when we had to combine our efforts and needed features that hadn't been fully or correctly implemented. Other challenges came around as we found gaps in our knowledge that we needed to either find alternatives for or quickly learn and implemented.
