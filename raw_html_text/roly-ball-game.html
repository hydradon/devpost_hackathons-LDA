                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was both of our first time attending a hackathon. Neither of us actually knew how to code, but as our understanding for the topic grew, we decided to attempt to make an game/app with unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is designed with the white sphere as the player. The arrows dictate the movement of this player. The goal of this game is to move the player in such a way that the sphere collects all of the small, rotating yellow coins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity tutorials and we developed and modified it to our own custom style and version.
                </p>
