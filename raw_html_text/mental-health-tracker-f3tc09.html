                    Some of our team members who have struggled with mental illness have noted that there doesn't exist a way to track one's mental health over time: mood diaries are outdated and inefficient, and attempting to recount two months' worth of emotions in a doctor's visit is impractical. Our website is a modern approach to this problem, catering to everyone: from patients working with their therapists to track the effectiveness of a medication to individuals who aren't sure if they are struggling with a mental illness or not. In the fully developed program, which we did not quite get time to finish, users would be able to quickly judge trends by the calendar on their dashboard. For more information, they can click on each cell of the calendar to view detailed mental health statistics. We also provide information for them to learn more about common mental illnesses and how to treat them, and hotlines for immediate help.
