                    that many students want to join. However due to the lack of communication many students don't show up to many meeting and are forced to miss the opportunity to join the club or sport.

                    What's next for ClubLife: We plan to add many more features to this website such as an interactive calendar, RSVP, and a notification system. We also want to push this concept to the app form and contact local schools and integrate our website into the school system. We believe that our website  has the potential to revolutionize all students lives.
