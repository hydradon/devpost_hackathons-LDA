                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an artist, video filmer and editor. Many artists are confused about locations and usually have to use word-of-mouth for location.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people to find desired filming locations. (ie: Graffiti wall, large steps)

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and Kivy
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing Google Api
Adding to a database
learning how to use kivy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having functional buttons that move through the program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of new python and Kivy code, and that connecting an api to a function in your code is harder than it seems
                </p>

                    What's next for Scene Share

                <p>
                    Continue to develop the functionality of the program and add more content (locations!)
