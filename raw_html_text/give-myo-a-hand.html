                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project came from a friend that we knew who could benefit from of a technology similar to this. We decided to use the myo as a way to help build muscle endurance in the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program used in conjunction with the myo armband us designed to test and help improve one's hand-eye coordination and muscle endurance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a java program and utilized the myo armband's nouse mode.We also set up some default commands in that mode that utilized the fist motion to click.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, it was quite difficult figuring out how to utilize the myo, as it took a while to come up with ideas regarding how to solve a real life problem with it. Afterwards, we ran into a problem regarding actually using it, as troubleshooting and learning its controls took much time. We also had trouble figuring out how to use multiple panels that occupy the same space as we wanted everything to be run under one driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we figured out how to use the myo, a new technology to both of us. We are also proud that we were able to utilize API's to learn new coding skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use input information from other technologies as well as the laptop, in order to make a program that utilizes both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Give Myo A Hand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step will be to add more activities, add a way to view your progress, and give more feedback from the activities that pertain to improvement in our program,
