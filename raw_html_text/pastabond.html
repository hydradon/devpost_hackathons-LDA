                    We found that finding great housemates that are respectful and compatible is difficult and a lot of times, depends on luck. We wanted to find a way to match people who are compatible with one another and find houses together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website lists the individual potential housemate - Spaghetto, and with questionnaires answered, users will be able to see a compatibility percentage and interact with them through the chat room function.
