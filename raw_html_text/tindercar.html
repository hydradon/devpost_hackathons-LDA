                        There was this cool car from Timing Architects that we wanted to try modern car safety features on and that we wanted to play around with

                        It detects when there is something in front of it and keeps a safe, constant distance to its surroundings

                    <li>
                        You can control the car using voice-control

                    <li>
                        You can make it do cool tricks (drift, dance...)
