                    One day I was in my bed and I got hungry. I walked downstairs only to discover that there was nothing worth eating in the fridge. Later that day I went to the store and we purchased groceries but forgot to get some of my favorite snacks. I thought "Wouldn't it be cool to know what's in my fridge without having to open the fridge door or looking in it?". I had previous coding experience and knew I could code the app if I had time and help. I kept my idea and when I found out I was going to participate in a hackathon I started coding. Now I can find out what is in my fridge without opening it... with the MiFridge app.
