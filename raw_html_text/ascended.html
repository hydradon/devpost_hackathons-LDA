                <p>
                    This game is about being a hero hellbent on taking down the titans, which have taken control of various lands. The hero is a very well outfitted demigod warrior. The hero, with his sword, gun, and powers of lightning will take down these titans.

                    Gameplay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In &lsquo;Ascended&rsquo;, the player assumes the role of a demigod, tasked with bringing down the fearsome creatures laying waste to the land. The focus is on leaving the strategy on defeating the monsters up to the players. We want the player to feel like he has control over the situation to a degree unlike most &ldquo;Arcade&rdquo; style VR games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gameplay involves using the vive controllers to fly as if you were Goku or Superman, with arms partially extended.  Direction of flight is determined by  how you point the trigger side of the controller, and press the grips. Additionally, the player will be outfitted with multiple different weapons to defeat the giant monsters who are your enemy. The player will be able to switch through these weapons with the touchpad based on the side of the touchpad that is pressed.

                    Dynamic flight based movement is the main mechanic in this game. The player has full freedom to move around within a designated space in the game. To move around he will use the controllers to point where he wants the velocity to push him and use the grip buttons to create the force. He will use this maneuverability to dodge monster attacks, as well as launch an offensive from any angle. A sword attached to the hand/controller is the first weapon designed, this weapon will do the most possible damage as the player will continually hurt the monster as long as the sword is in him. A Gun was the next weapon designed which is attached to the hand and the trigger fires. This weapon will do the least amount of damage as it is the easiest weapon to use. The last weapon is a thrown lightning bolt which is a more difficult ranged weapon than the gun, but will do more damage than it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lightning bolt spawns upon trigger pull if it is selected and then gathers the velocity of the controler and multiplies it to create a god like feel when thrown. The monster will have attacks based on its theme and design, largely based on its region/biome.  An emphasis is placed on the difficulty of the monster; a &ldquo;one life&rdquo; system means the player will have to carefully choose how they engage the enemy.
