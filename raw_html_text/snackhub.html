                <p>
                    These days, it's becoming easier to share things we love such as music, movies and TV shows. But there is something missing - Our snacks. We want something that can help us discover new snacks and share our own experiences with other fellow snack lovers.

                    SnackHub is all about snacks. You can post new snacks you come across, discover what others love, and rate any snack. As you engage with the community, the platform learns more and more about you, to provide you with more relevant suggestions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many obstacles along the way, especially in areas related to database and UI/UX. For instance, we spent hours designing a database schema that can represent complex relationships, as well as a simple and intuitive UI that instantly makes sense to a newcomer.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad that we overcame so many difficulties and learned a lot in our journey. We experimented with different kinds of data structures in MongoDB, trying to find the most efficient one to ensure the flexibility and scalability of our app. It's also our first experience creating a full-fledged AJAX-based refreshless app.

                    What we learned

                    The process of defining and implementing APIs. Web technologies to improve accessibility of websites and webapps.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to implement more underlying logics that we have thought of and defined. Machine learning can be used in the application to accomplish better results. From the business prospective, this platform will be great for snack manufacturers to do early marketing research and trial item deployment.
