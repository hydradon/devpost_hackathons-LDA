                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was mainly the lack of awareness the general public has for its overuse of crucial resources like water and electricity. We also did not see proactive administration of extensive utilities that influence consumer behaviour to reduce their usage. This prompted us to create something that would propel the government's standing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we have sensors that integrate into all the power outlets and water outlets in every house. These sensors are all connected to the internet through a generic controller like the Arduino board. This website receives the data that the sensors upload to a server and handle it in various ways. It displays the current real time consumption and cost, as well as the consumption and cost for the previous days and months. The way this website is a part of 10X is because no government in the world provides usage monitoring kits to their citizens. We aspire for this website and sensor combination to be incredibly successful in helping consumer's reduce wastage and DEWA in generating alternate revenue by providing these kits and the certification that goes along with it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us in the group are front-end and back-end developers web developers and we utilised our knowledge to create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL databases to achieve our visionary website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are both developers, it was easy for us to code the website from scratch but hard for us to make it business oriented. However, with the help of the mentors, we were able to realise the potential our project held and express it. Another challenge we ran into was that we did not have enough time to optimise the website for mobile-clients and screens smaller than 1080p. As such, the website was able to be fully optimised only for laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how well the website came together, specifically the way the information was able to be handled efficiently and passed on to the user without compromising aesthetics, all within 24 hours. We are also very excited to see the government disruption take place on a large scale in the way we have envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing we learnt was the efficient management of time when presented with a short deadline. We had to produce something complete in a mere 24 hours and without proper time management and workload distribution we would not have been able to achieve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Usage Command
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We eagerly wanted to code in more features such as the recording of time of day and the usage associated with it. This would enable the user to find out peak hours and act accordingly as well as be completely conscious of their usage even when they are not home. 
Another feature we wanted to implement was the integration with the DEWA Smart App and the Smart Bill so that we could increase many-fold the convenience to the user with our new innovations.
One last feature we would like to implement in the future is, a suggestion feature. This feature would look at a customers overall usage and suggest ways to reduce their usage.
