                        With the rapid growth of technology, particularly with small scale devices, the potential to provide aid to those that are disabled, elderly, of chronically ill is far higher. Using near field communication means giving people faster and more reliable health aid at a moments notice. Integrating NFC technology within a card that fits into your wallet, a wearable tag that can be adhesed to your phone, or within an 128-bit AES encrypted sub-dermal

                        device means that data exchange can be done all with the wave of a NFC capable smartphone. Faster transaction times means faster response rate and could be the determining factor of one's life.

                        NFC is a form of contactless communication between devices like smartphones or tablets. The technology behind NFC allows a reader device to create a radio frequency current that communicates with another NFC compatible device or a small NFC tag holding the information the reader wants. This allows both devices to send and receive information. In simplest terms allows a user to wave a receiver over a NFC compatible device to send information without needing to touch the devices together.

                        Our overarching goal is to use NFC devices to store in depth medical records, emergency contact information and user identification that can be easily accessible to emergency responders. Not only did we want to provide an easily accessible way for first responders to view important medical information, but we also wanted to allow doctors to update this information on the fly, without needing to update the NFC devices afterwards. To accomplish this, we set up a website that hosts different pages of medical info for each unique serial number of the NFC devices. These sites update in real time and reflect changes on the NFC devices in seconds.
