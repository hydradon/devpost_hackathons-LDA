                    DigiClick is a glove that allows the user control the cursor on his or her computer. The intuitive controls make navigating a breeze and allows the user to navigate without the restrictions mice or trackpads. To move the cursor, the user simply rotates his or her hand in the desired direction. To click the user depresses and retracts their index finger much like clicking an invisible mouse. To right click, the user simple presses the button located on the tip of the middle finger. Scrolling functionality has also been implemented by clicking and right clicking at the same time and rotating the hand in the desired scroll direction. DigiClick can also be disabled by pressing the green button located on the back of the wrist in order to type or do other tasks while wearing the glove.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build DigiClick, we connected a flex sensor to an Imuduino. The flex sensor allows us to detect when the user depresses his or her finger which allows us to register a click. In order to determine a click from noise, we use a running average to compute the resistance of the flex sensor over multiple samples. To track mouse movement, we use the Imuduino's built in 10dof sensor  which allows us to track the position and rotation of the glove. A push button allows us to give the user right click functionality and a button on the back of the wrist allows the user to disable the glove. Once all of the components were working together on a breadboard, we went ahead and soldered them on a pcb project board in order to reduce the size of the project and make it wearable. Once the device was small enough to wear, we used wire and tape to secure it to the glove.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining the correct threshold for of the flex sensor to register a click proved to be more challenging than we expected. Some of the logic used to control the clicks also gave us some trouble as the glove would frequently get stuck holding down left click. Attaching everything to the glove in a manner that was both comfortable and function also proved to be quite a challenge especially since the Imuduino needed to be positioned rather preceisly in order to function correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to reduce the size of the device to a wearable size and solder the components to the board correctly on the first attempt. We are also proud of how relatively reliable the glove is considering how quickly it was put together and how little we knew about controlling a cursor before hand.
