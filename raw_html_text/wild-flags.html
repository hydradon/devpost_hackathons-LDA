                    There's really not too much to say. The app is a straightforward implementation of the requested features in the Hackathon prompt. The app provides a secure, limited-access database of wildlife trafficking assets (vehicles, facilities, individuals, etc.) to NGO's that need an anonymous way of communicating with one another about which assets they are investigating. The app allows authorized NGO members to search existing assets to determine if they are being actively investigated, to mark assets as under investigation by their organization, and to cancel investigations on assets that they are no longer investigating. The app offers users opportunities to provide additional info about the assets, their own organization, and the investigations, but does not require additional or identifying information for use. The challenges we faced were around the implementation of biometric authentication (fingerprint scanner) and database search query accuracy.
