                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired by PennCampusExplorer, an app that shows users their location on a well-drawn map of Penn's campus, with all buildings clearly labeled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it shows users their location on Kent State's campus, with buildings and parking lots outlined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Swift and the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get the image to sync up properly with the map's coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working demo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit about making iOS apps and using the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mapplication_KSU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to add the ability to switch overlays on the map, so that users can change the look and feel of the map. Furthermore, we think an interesting idea would be to add a feature where users tell the app which parking lot(s) they have a permit for and the days and times they expect to be at the parking lot. If someone from a parking lot close to campus tells the app they won't be there a certain day, the app can give that spot to someone from a parking lot further away from campus, thus more efficiently utilizing available parking spaces and increasing convenience. Also, it would give us the opportunity to make use of/learn about databases.
