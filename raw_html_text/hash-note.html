                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As musicians and music fans we believe in empowering artists by ensuring they get paid.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generate a transactionable link between music and owners through content based addressing as a unique and definite identifier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a team using github. We took the melspectrum a piece of music and performed a perceptual hash on it. Then we store the hash on the DAPP integrating all collaborators, collaborators payment addresses as their individual percentages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to receive the events released from the DAPP at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also added a indentification tool that we haven't integrated yet but which would allow music to be recognized like through shazam and allow a per play payment.
                </p>
