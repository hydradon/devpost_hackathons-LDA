                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this app was born from a desire to create a more realistic online learning environment to benefit both teachers and students. This is achieved through monitoring students during online lectures and determining when they are paying attention through their facial reactions. With this information, teachers can learn and examine the sections of a lecture which have lost most students attention, and work towards reiterating those concepts to ultimately benefit the students.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses computer vision and machine learning to guard and promote student engagement in an online classroom.

                    What's next for Oculearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned Oculearn as an academic platform which aided teachers in providing an optimized learning experience for their students. Thus, we would add the ability to share a screen sharing feed along in sync with live audio. In addition, we would iterate with data retention using MongoDB that enables data analytics and continuous online learning.
