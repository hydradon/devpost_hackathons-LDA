                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs) are events during which untreated sewage is released by a sanitary sewer into the environment before arriving at a wastewater treatment facility.[1] SSOs pose serious health risks. Human health can be compromised through exposure to microbial pathogens originating from fecal matter, including viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens.[2] Environmental health may also suffer as pollutants from SSOs end up in surface waters, where they exert oxygen demand and high nutrient loads accelerate eutrophication.[3] SSOs should be prevented to avoid these health consequences, yet the pathway to prevention is not simple, especially since SSOs have long been regarded as unpredictable. Without prediction capability, clean-up crews can only react to spill reports, oftentimes arriving at the spill site where contaminated water is already seeping into the ground or making its way to surface water.

                <p>
                    Based on input variables relating to environmental, weather, and infrastructure data, I developed a model that can predict the order of magnitude of a wet weather sanitary sewer overflow in California with reasonable accuracy. Prediction capability of sanitary sewer overflow volume is useful to city officials so they can anticipate clean-up needs and environmental impacts.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I curated several large datasets from the Cal EPA SSO Interactive Report, Cal EPA Sewer Agency Questionnaire, and NOAA daily weather summaries. I combined and aligned these datasets to create a dataset of spills with many predictor variables (55,000 spills x 31 variables). After separating my dataset into training and testing sets, I developed a multivariate regression model. Since SSOs are highly complex in nature, I wanted to consider nonlinear interactions between variables and analyze how this could improve predictability of spill volumes. I therefore added many cross products and scalar divisions between variables in this model. I also used trigonometric functions and analyzed certain variables at a higher power. I used ANOVA testing to determine the significance of variables. While the multivariate regression model yielded predictions with a larger margin of error than I would have hoped, it was still useful for determining which variables and nonlinear interactions between variables were significant. I then moved on to developing a random forest model (which was successful!) and added the most significant variables from the multivariate regression model.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge I ran into involved missing values in my datasets. 48,000 of the 55,000 spills I was analyzing had one or more missing variable value. I used k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) imputation to overcome this problem. Related challenges included obtaining relevant datasets general data wrangling issues.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creation of my complete dataset required significant time and effort. I&rsquo;m proud of this dataset and recognize that it likely contains the answers to many more questions than currently investigated. I&rsquo;m also proud of the success of my model in successfully predicting the order of magnitude of SSOs.

                    What's next for Predicting Sanitary Sewer Overflows via Random Forests
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to develop an interactive tool for government officials and decision makers so they can estimate SSO volumes in advance of a spill event. I also intend to forecast how the frequency and volume of SSOs may change with climate change and specifically the predicted increase of &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; events (extreme rain to extreme drought).
