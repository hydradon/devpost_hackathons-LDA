                    Apostrophe has changed the way students interact with other students in the same courses with the easy swipe of a screen. It&rsquo;s so much more than a networking app. Apostrophe is a powerful platform that matches prospective students with one another through a novel interface and interaction design. It provides a safe space for young minds to come together and bridge the gap that is often faced by many commuter students.

                    Apostrophe is a location based app that connects students to other students in the area. The app requires users to fill in their basic personal information in order to match with relevant peers. Users are able to set their distance in the discovery preferences area of the app.

                    Geolocation is the basis of the application. Without it, the app would be useless since it is all about finding people near you. Use Google / Apple Locations and Maps services to integrate the geolocation. For Android, you are going to employ the classes of android.location package and the MapView class, for iOS - the CLLocationManager Class and Map Kit framework.

                    As any other app, Apostrophe allows adjusting the appropriate setting for the convenience of usage. For example, you can enable or disable the notifications as for the creation of new matches, receiving messages. You can also choose  preferable units of measurement for displaying a distance (km or mi).

                <p>
                    Receiving notifications can be implemented via the interaction of your application with Apple / Google servers. The device where the app is installed is registered on the appropriate OS server and gets a certain ID. Afterwards, the app server supplies the app with the push notifications if they come. To enable push notifications in your Android app use GSM (Google Cloud Messaging). For iOS app refer to APN (Apple Push Notifications).
