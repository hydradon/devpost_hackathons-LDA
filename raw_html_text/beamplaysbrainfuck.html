                    The goal of this project was to create an interactive 
element to esoteric programing using Beam.Pro's interactive API. It's also fairly insired by the "Twitch Plays" phenomena.

                    Brainfuck, as an
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language" rel="nofollow">
                        esoteric language
                    </a>
                    , consists of only 8 
characters:
                    <code>
                        [ ] &lt; &gt; , . - +
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these character's it's possible to produce actual programmatic results through memory cell manipulation, in a sort 
of ticker-tape fashion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the language's already high entry point of complexity, it felt like it would have been interesting to see if 
multiple strangers from the internet could successfully program in brainfuck together. It's with this idea that the 
project became a reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And when we finally did make it...it turned out to be a mess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this is the most convoluted way of writing out "Hello World!" becuase not only is it being done in a language that consists of only 8 characters, it's being done on an Azure Virtual Instance that's kept alive via an AWS instance through RDP. Without the aforementioned setup, the streaming software has no way of keeping it's view on the Brainfuck IDE.
