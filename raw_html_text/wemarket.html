                    Barter: interactive map-based distribution &amp; analytics for hyperlocal market transactions

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are leveraging the economic transactions of a local community by recording them on a interactive, consumer-friendly map utilizing the Quipu ledger that allows anyone to log into and contribute to &mdash; as easily as they log into WhatsApp &amp; Facebook in these communities. We believe that economic transactions should be as easy as socializing has been made for these communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By distributing records of these transactions, I believe that "bartering" for goods in multiple communities of underdeveloped countries can truly become decentralized in their conduct of business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Workers in the Global South are empowered by their ability to create business profiles on Barter, regardless of their background.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Barter platform, they have access to the following features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            Map-based events to view transaction recording
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            See a public list of available goods/services and past sales
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            Vote for a new head of market, at anytime
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And the workers as a whole possess the ability to do collective bargains, with a head of market who is delegated to conduct deals for the entire community, with these features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            Export analytic data directly to an Alibaba manufacturer
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            Track trends of product demand and order supplies based on that value
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            Leverage the sum of a communities' business value for individual loans
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the open availability of the Quipu ledger, merchants are not judged on their existing prestige but rather their ability exchange goods and services repeatedly, with good rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our understanding
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assets on the digital ledger are reminiscent of medieval times where the centuries-old predecessor to blockchain was merely a shop's bookkeeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to think of it as a decentralized administration of consensus, and thus, a hyper-local map of mutual credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By distributing all of a communities' records and providing evidence of healthy business transactions, we hope to leverage value to manufacturers who may have not produced demanded goods for these communities otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps will be exploring different options of incorporating more blockchain technology into Barter, finishing up full integrations with the Quipu blockchain and possibly an iOS/Android mobile client.
