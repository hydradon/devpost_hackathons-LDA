                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were intrigued by the idea of deeper user engagement and realized that for a completely virtual experience, one must be able to communicate using words with other aspects of the VR-world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our "hack" uses voice commands to control the movement of a race car around a track. We chose a racing setting, but the concept can be applied to most VR aspects for a deeper user involvemnent.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic. But really integrating voice recognition APIs into the world used, as well as a ton of red-bull,coffee/other caffeine sources.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to select an effective voice recognition software, which turned out to be much more challenging than we had originally anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew essentially nothing about voice recognition and Unity. However, we finished having learned a significant amount of information pertaining to them both, as well as how they could improve the world of Virtual Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Look Ma! No Hands!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual Reality and faster running time. At the moment, voice recognition takes a while to respond, but if it continues to develop, it could change the way we play games.
