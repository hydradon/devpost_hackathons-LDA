                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool was inspired by a novel by Dan Brown. His book, Digital Fortress, describes the delicacy of security in such a technologically advanced era. One of the things talked about is Brute Force methods of hacking, which is at its essence, trial and error to an infinite scale. So, we thought we'd create our very own Brute Force Password Cracker.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Program will take a given password (that you input) and will try to guess and match it. It accomplishes this by trial and error until it meets the combination of the password. Depending on the complexity of the password, it will take time. So, in a manner of speaking, it will 'Crack' your password.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it all on a python IDLE on a website called Repl.it . We enjoyed ourselves a lot along the way. And balanced our fun and the task at hand. We started with a basic UI, which takes the user inputs and informs them of what exactly this program is. It took mostly our brain power to build it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were frustrating moments, but we balanced it out with having a fun time. We had issues with the combination generation (function) part of the code.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a hacking tool in a weekend.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brute Force Password Crackers can be used to obtain passwords, yet are inefficient and take a lot of time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Password Cracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reduce the amount of code? Make it more efficient?
