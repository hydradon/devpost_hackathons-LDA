                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using public computers in libraries and netcafes, I was unable to encrypt files because guest users are unable to download and install software. This project seeks to make encryption possible anywhere with internet access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypts files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Bottle.py for framework, HTML5 for designing the website, Python 3.4.2 for the encryption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly technical difficulties in decrypting files. Also difficult to allow files to be altered if user does not have admin access.
                </p>
                <h2>
