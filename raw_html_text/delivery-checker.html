                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My dad is a pharmacist, and he said that for delivery men, especially for patients with multiple drugs. It is easy for people to mix up orders. Especially because each patient has a bar code, not each item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to use a google API to scan a bar code, save it as a variable, and then scan a second bar-code to compare to the first bar code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it using Android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into issues because I did not know JAVA, I also had no clue what to do to implement the API. The API was also out of date and was running in different versions. I had to restart my app many times. Even now I could not get the app to scan and detect the bar code, even though the API seems to be working.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning some of the syntax of Android Studio, and figuring out how to open the camera on my phone using API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You need permission to use the Camera, it is also much more difficult than I thought to implement API's
                </p>

                    What's next for Delivery Checker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great if my Dad could put this to use where he works.
