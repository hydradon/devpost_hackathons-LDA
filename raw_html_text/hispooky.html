                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the Twilio API and Halloween. We wanted to create a cool Halloween hack that allowed multiple users to participate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Groups of users can send a text each to create a collaborative Halloween story. Each user gets one text per story and they add their sentence
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twilio API utilizing Python mainly. We used Flask for the basis of the hack and used NGROK which allowed us to make hack live.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first none of us have used Python or an API which was a little challenge. In addition most of us didn't know how to connect the application to the web. The people at Twilio gave us a direction at first which allowed us to finish our hack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got to implement my first API! Also this hack allowed me to learn about SMS messages in depth. The Twilio API is pretty cool and I hope to use it again in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for HiSpooky
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to utilize the Twilio API to make a live website with a visual representation of the Spooky Story. To accomplish this we would like to have the story read to the users on the website utilizing the HP Haven ONDemand API.
