                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The free version of nginx lack metrics for in-depth monitoring of the server. Lot of the useful metrics are available only in the paid version of nginx or using metrics plugins which are again non-free. The idea of this project is to expose some of the very useful metrics from nginx using the compiled in lua support for nginx.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have written lua code that uses nginx lua library and extract the metrics by polling nginx at regular intervals. These metrics are then pushed to a graphite server where the extracted metrics from nginx are plotted using the grafana frontend for graphite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Lua was something new for each team member, we had to understand it and then write the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though completely new to lua, we were able to complete the metrics collection and plotting end to end in the given time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how we can utilise the Lua plugins and write Lua code to get internal data of nginx.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for nginx metrics with lua
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, we have extracted only a few metrics. More metrics can be added which are available only in the paid version of nginx currently and this can be made open source as well.
