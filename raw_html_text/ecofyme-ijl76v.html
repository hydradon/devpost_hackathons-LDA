                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the popular #TrashTag challenge that motivates people to clean up trash around their community and take before/after pics.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EcofyMe allows registered users to view a map of their community and join or host clean up events that on locations of trash that is posted by other users on the map.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Firebase as our back-end solution for storing the pictures taken by users and managing the user base. Bootstrap was used to streamline the front-end development and the Google-maps JS web API was used to display the map and pin markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we faced were developing the back-end and hooking it to the front end and managing the user authentication tokens.

                    Accomplishments that were proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for most of us and we are proud that we were able to plan can complete a whole and working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google-maps API, get location with the Geolocation API, and upload photos to Firebase

                    What's next for EcofyMe
