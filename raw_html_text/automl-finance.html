                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want a job/internships in Google so it is good way for us to try it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a ML

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Python of course.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically we thought we knew everything. And then, all of a sudden, we knew nothing. All seemed to have lost. And actually, it did lose.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn a great deal of friendship and ML. We don't need github for code. We build our own. Woohoo!!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to build big things. Build small things. Things that can be pasted to Power Point easily. And we should have gone to sleep
