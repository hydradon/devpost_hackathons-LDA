                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There appears to be a one-hit solution to cater to all browser-based applications. The current solutions I've found take a heap space of memory to run any available ML library available (browser-based). My focus at the moment is to spearhead the user's device capabilities first and then supply the most effective runtime solution. There will always be a need to allow the less fortunate to race and be educated to the highest level of the most fortunate.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detects the user's device and runtime and supplies the most efficient solution possible so that the user can experience the core essence of the current and future possibilities available. Personal inspiration comes from standing on the shoulders of giants and give access to all less fortunate.

                    I have absolutely no idea at this point in time. What I do know is that we are at the cusp of the next AI revolution and the direction is being dictated by corporates.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User device and OS capabilities. One hat does not fit all especially if you have a very big head.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being drunk myself and seeing someone drunker than me and making sure they get home safe and sound. Even if it cost me.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never suppress passion even if some cock sucker CTO has their own agenda to create their perfect team who bark and jump to their every command. Never be driven by money, believe in yourself and your dreams.
