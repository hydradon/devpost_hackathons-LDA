                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was the wage gap between men and women, and between certain races, and the idea that making it easier for a company to be able to see any general difference in the pay between employees of different gender or different race would help mitigate this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows a user to input a text file containing data about employees (name, salary, gender, race) and shows a bar graph comparing the average pay for each gender and for each race.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript, CSS, and HTML to create this app. Using bootstrap and jQuery, we were able to tweak the appearance of the UI to exactly what we wanted. Photoshop was used for the logo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the problem of linking to code from another language, as the algorithm was originally written in Java. We also started developing the GUI in Java but soon realized that using a Java GUI was much more difficult than using CSS, Javascript, and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the way the GUI looks and the analysis of both gender and race in relation to wages. It's always a good feeling seeing an idea through to completion and getting a working prototype. The future possibilities of this app are exciting and the implications that it could have towards social justice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about what to do and what not to do when developing UI. I learned a lot about things that I will need to know in order to improve on this in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wage Balance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to allow Wage Balance to be able to pull information from a database rather than a text file. This was unfortunately not in any of our skillsets at the time of making it, but this is the next logical step for the program. Wage Balance could benefit greatly from being able to analyze more metrics besides race and gender and we would like to give a wide ranger of statistical analyses from these data points!
