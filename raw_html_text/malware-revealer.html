                    <p>
                        It's a simple 3 steps process:
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Chose which features you want to extract

                    <a rel="nofollow">
                        You will need to list the features you wanna extract in a configuration file, check this

                    to learn setup the extractor. If one of the features isn't already implemented, you can either make an issue an wait for someone to implement it, or implement it yourself and make a Pull Request :D check this

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Prepare your dataset
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now you need to prepare your dataset, it consists of executable files, organized in subdirectory, each subdirectory represents a class of executables, here is an example:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>    $ tree executables/
                executables/
    ├── 0
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── example.exe
    └── 1
    └── example.exe
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here we have represented two classes of executables, either a malware (1) or not (0).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Extraction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once you have your configuration file and dataset ready, you can proceed to the extraction. To run the extractor you have two choices, install the requirements and then run it or use the ready to use Docker

                    </a>
                    . Here I'm gonna explain the usage of the Docker image since it's simpler.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you don't have Docker already installed,

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will now assume that you have the dataset and the configuration file in the working directory as ./executables/ and ./conf.yaml
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <pre class="language-bash"><code>$ docker container run --rm -v $PWD:/data:ro -v $PWD/out:/out malwarerevealer/extractor /data/conf.yaml /data/executables -o /out
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    You will then find the extracted features under ./out

                    It is responsible for taking an executable as input, doing the necessary parsing and extraction of features that should be relevant, to be able to classify our executable as malware or not.

                    The extractor should be able to extract features from multiple types of executable which are meant to different CPU architectures.
