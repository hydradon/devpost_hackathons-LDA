                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came to hackpsu for extra credit, but I thought while I was here to take advantage of the event and try to learn something new. So after sitting through a short workshop in unity I thought it is something that seems kind of fun and I know nothing about.  So I teach myself through unity online informative material, then built a neat local multiplayer game that reminded me of old flash games.
