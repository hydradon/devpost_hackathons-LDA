                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    John is an inspiration to everyone here on the Hack the Heights team. We decided to pay tribute to this wonderful human being in the best way possible!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack displays John&rsquo;s future, with a stunning bit of accuracy due to intelligent machine learning algorithms generated by the application through block chain technology and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used only the finest bit of technology available: we built the backend in C++, spruced up the frontend in Python, charged the flux capacitor in assembly, restructured the mainframe in Java, and then used a bagel to tie it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    John, as an incredibly versatile human being, becomes too difficult to predict certain future possibilities. We decided to mitigate that by assuming he was not going to do anything crazy, outlandish, and ridiculous in the future, like organize another hackatho

                    What's next for John&rsquo;s Crystal Ball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to see if we can predict his past with the same kind of accuracy we used to predict his future.
