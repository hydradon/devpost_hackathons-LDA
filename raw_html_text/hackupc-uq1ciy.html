                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After thinking a lot about cv's and considering how difficult it is to make them look decent without using latex, we decided to make a website that helps people that do not understand (or can not be bothered with) latex code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters details about himself in a typeform and the data then gets passed to our web app which uses that data and a cv template to create the candidates cv.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the typeform API to create the form and retrieve the data, php to manipulate that data and fill up the cv template and css and html for the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspects of this hack were: 1. Retrieving the data from JSON to use as variables,  2. Converting a .tex file to .pdf through php in windows and 3. Replacing the stubs in the CV file with the actual values of the user.
                </p>

                </h2>
