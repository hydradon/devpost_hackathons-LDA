                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a part of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers at UC San Diego; in this club, I am working on a project with my partner for the quarter. Our project is Heartmate, so I worked on it for the duration of Cal Hacks 3.0 while my partner was unable to attend this event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A person places his or her finger on the heartbeat sensor, which detects his or her heartbeat. The heartbeat sensor sends the information of the heartbeat to the website where the info is displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and PHP in order to build the website, and Raspberry Pi for a web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no previous experience using PHP, so I had to self-teach PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got my website to work functionally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heartmate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to create a mobile app version that also displays the heartbeat info.
