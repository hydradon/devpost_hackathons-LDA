                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a first semester freshman, this is my first hackathon and I have minimal knowledge about programming just what I have learnt in high school and in COM S 227 which I am currently in. Therefore I was leaning on my teammates to help me with the other parts such as the GUI/User Interface. Unfortunately, my teammates decided that they would leave after dinner on Friday and haven't come back. Therefore I spent the entire 36 hours building this piece of software that can work perfectly if someone knows how to pair it to a hardware or User Interface.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simulator that I built does everything that your normal vending machine can do minus the exception of refilling the machine. The machine can detect bills and coins inserted into the system and displays messages when too little money has been inserted or there is not enough change in the machine which results in a exact change only message. it also deducts product each time someone buys it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the basics of change and items (load items, load change) then I created the machine itself with a main method that has the basic code for how to figure out change and checking the amount of money inserted. Finally I created the method makeChange which makes the change needed which displays the type of coin given out as a message.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into I am not very experienced in programming and the fact that my teammates never came back after 5 texts and 2 phone calls really hurt my changes of making an actual product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I was able to make it through the full 36 hours with part of the product (software) that actually works how I want it to !

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You cannot really trust your teammates and have to be self-dependent but also people are really willing to help you if you just ask for it even if they are not on your team.
                </p>

                    What's next for VendingMachineSimulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still have a lot to learn but if I can learn how to make a GUI then this can turn into a full project and then maybe an app. Who knows?
