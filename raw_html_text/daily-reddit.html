                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea from Daily Digests and thought it would be cool to use twilio to send people a sort of digest from reddit.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives you the top 5 posts in r/all hot and sends it straight to your phone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used twilio to send the text and praw to get the data on reddit. Praw is reddit's own API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time doing a hackathon, so the biggest issue was actually deciding an idea and getting organized enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it may seem small, we're pretty proud of being able to use twilio and figuring out how praw worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so many things from twilio to firebase in an attempt to make something for this hackathon. CloudSQL was also one of the more difficult things that we tried to learn and we had gained some pretty good experience for it.

                <p>
                    We honestly have no clue.
