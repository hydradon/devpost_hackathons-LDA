                    Intro
Welcome to "School of Rocks"! You are a prospecting entrepreneur who has stumbled across a large patch of land. In the vicinity, you can see vast amounts of dirt. Off to the side, you can make out a large forest, a cave, and a large vein of surface ore. You fondly remember your time as a student, and you decide to stay here and create an establishment for students to flourish. However, you don&rsquo;t want it to be any plain old university; you want it to be a university on top of a mountain. You quickly set to work to fulfill your dream, one scoop of dirt at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic Mechanics
"School of Rocks" is an incremental game. There are 5 resources in the game: Dirt, Wood, Stone, Metal and Students. Dirt is used to build up Burnaby Mountain, while the buildings that comprise the university are constructed with wood, stone and metal. 
To gather resources (except for students), click on the corresponding button/area. Dirt can be gathered if you click anywhere within the play area. To help you in your endeavour, you can purchase tools to make your clicks more efficient, or you can hire workers or purchase machines to automatically collect resources for you. 
Students are purchased with dirt. Students can be sent to raid other institutions. All raids have a 50% chance of success so don't rely on them too heavily!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Random Events
There is a very small possibility that your university is struck by an earthquake or a fire. These are tragic accidents that cannot be avoided unfortunately.
