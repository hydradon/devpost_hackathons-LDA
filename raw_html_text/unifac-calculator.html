                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a tool that would be useful to people in my 2nd major, Chemical Engineering. One of the most difficult topics in ChE is vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE). For non-ideal VLE systems, a factor called the activity coefficient must be found in order to accurately describe the system. There are many different methods to calculate this value, and arguably the best is the UNIFAC method because it takes into account more information than the other methods. However, this method is very intensive and involves many complex calculations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All one needs to do is input the VLE system components, their mole fractions, and the system temperature, and the back-end code will do the intensive calculations necessary to calculate the activity coefficients for each species in the system.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking my database with my javascript code. Currently, the database values will be hardcoded in, and I hope to fix this in the future. Also to save on time, the parser will be pretty dumb.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned more about javascript, handling large arrays in javascript.

                <p>
                    Improvements to the parser, giving the ability for more component options. Linking with database to again allow for more components.
