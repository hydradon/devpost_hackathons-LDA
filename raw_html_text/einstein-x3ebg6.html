                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart bulbs are too expensive for what they are. We figured that we could make a web-app, smart LED that can take advantage of the endless features of your Amazon echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon AWS, certain commands are triggered with the voice, such as color change, whose values will then be sent to the nodejs webserver and finally through a monodirectional pipe to the python scripts that directly control the LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To program Einstein most efficiently, we divided and conquered the work - front end, backend python, backend javascript, Alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, we feel that this was the best way to manage our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble trying to setup threading that would allow Einstein to keep the LEDs flashing at their current PWM, but check for new arguments through the pipe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to a program that can send commands from an Amazon Alexa, using our voices, to change the color of an LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges taught us a lot about what you should and should not use when you're crunched for time- avoid using anything but javascript and python. Biggest of all: DON'T USE PIP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Einstein
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to use the GPIOs to feed the base of a transistor that allows current to flow from any electronic device to ground, essentially making any electronic device "smart."
