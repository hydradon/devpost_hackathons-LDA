                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure web services and Android application programming to implement our application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the limited information on Azure web services, specifically SignalR, we ran into significant roadblocks when uploading the data to the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an application that can communicate with Azure and also implement intuitive design in order to create an efficient and enjoyable

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how web sockets worked and the effect it has on the effectiveness of hubs and Signalr. We got the chance to manipulate a data base and rapidly collect and distribute data

                    What's next for TapJam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, TapJam can expand with more instruments and bigger group capability. Also more streamlined processes and better UI design would be more beneficial to our users
