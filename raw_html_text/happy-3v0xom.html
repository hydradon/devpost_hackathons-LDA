                </h1>
                <p>
                    Inspired by simplistic and beautiful new tab pages like Momentum and Embark, Serotonin is an extension that seeks to spread happiness through positive messages. Rather than incorporating a traditional clock, we built a countdown timer that reminds users how much time they have left to make their day amazing. At the end of the day, users have the option of submitting a short snippet about what made their day so great&mdash;-then waiting a few seconds to read about what made someone else's day incredible.

                    Background images were curated and integrated into the extension thanks to

                </h1>
                <p>
                    We're always looking to improve UI and UX, and hope to make this extension available on the Chrome Web Store soon.
