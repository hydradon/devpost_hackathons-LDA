                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a smart city not only will technology advance, but those who are not capable of enjoying the current technology must also be brought up to par.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses 5 gestures to create messages which could potentially be sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using c++ to accept a 5 bit binary sequence, a fist as a 0 and fingers spread as a 1, which is assigned to all 26 letters as well as "." "," "!" "?" ";" and a space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limitations in the Myo Armband included either locks in the current position or large delays between a change in hand position to the Myo recognizing the change. These challenges hindered optimized results
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working product which would potentially be used by someone who lacks the fine motor skill needed to text on a smart phone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disability Assist Messaging
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project could be developed into a smart phone app through the android or ios SDKs which contain the same functions used for this version. Predictive text could also be included to reduce message creation time.
