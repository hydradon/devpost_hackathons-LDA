                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New York City is prone to epidemics among other things. People need a way to stay safe, to avoid outbreaks and to warn each other. Hazard helps everyone to become heroes through helping each other to see various forms of disease outbreaks and noise pollution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hazard uses New York Open Data to pinpoint places on the map where things such as noise pollution and disease outbreaks may be present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps Api, hosted it on Firebase and accessed New York Open Data. We used IBM Bluemix's Natural Language Classifier to analyze the CSV file we got from NYC Open Data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the Google Maps Api, IBM Bluemix Suite
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a working prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that NYC is a very delicate city and the population needs to be their own heroes to safeguard their welfare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hazard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will work on it in our free time. We want add more functionality and possibly take it live.
