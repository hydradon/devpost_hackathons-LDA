                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be a good programmer, you need to be able to type fast, and the most efficient way to type is to touch type! Using the standard touch-typing tools is not fun, but playing games such as guitar hero or piano tiles is. Therefore, we decided to change the idea of tapping to the rhythm of a song to typing to the rhythm of a song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can choose a song and the difficulty level - easy, intermediate and hard - and the melody (currently the program only has 7 melodies). You click 'play', you get a countdown and you get a visual display of the keyboard in front of you, along with the amount of Misses, OKs, Goods, Greats, Perfects and the score. As each key lights up green, you need to press that key (and the key will light up to, roughly, the rhythm of the melody). The key fades to black so therefore the greener it is when you press it, you get more points. (Perfect = 5 points and it goes down by 1 for each other category). Easy is for beginner 'typers' so therefore the keys appearing on the screen will be more or less slow and with regular intervals, intermediate is harder than easy, with most melodies also having regular intervals in between key presses, and hard having keys appearing more to the melody, thus making it non-regular and harder - for people who can already touch type well and want to improve!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Unity (using c#) and used a small program in Python to automate the process of selecting which beat should have a character pop up on.

                <p>
                    Constant bugs as not so experienced with unity; getting characters to appear to the melody in a possible-to-react way
