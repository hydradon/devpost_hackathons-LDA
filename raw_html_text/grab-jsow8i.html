                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration came from the idea that it can just a little bit more of someone's day, likely someone who doesn't see well.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizes text from images with text and allow the user to see it over the image or without, whatever helps them.

                    sending binary image data in a different form to be accepted by the api and challenges of javascript scoping issues.
