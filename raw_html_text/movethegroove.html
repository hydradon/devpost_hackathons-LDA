                    Move2Groove is a collaborative music generation tool. Instead of listening to your favorite DJ or Band and dance to their music, you make the music while you move. The more people join, the higher the groove. So grab your smartphone and let's get groovin'!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is two different types of entities. And by entity I mean you. You can either be a director or an instrument. On your device you can choose what you want to be. The director sends out waves. Every time a wave hits an instrument its sound gets played. When your sound gets played is determined by your distance to the director. If you move, you change when your sound gets played and therefor change the song.
You have your phone in your pocket. With the Nuimo device you can choose between the different types and instruments. You can also change your pitch and gain.
The sounds you can choose from are available on Soundcloud. You can even upload you own custom sound.
The entire song can be recorded an uploaded to Soundcloud later.
White you make your groove you can also stream it to an online radio station so other people who are to lazy to move can listen to your groove.
