                <p>
                    If you're anything like us, you spend a lot of time clicking through Coursera for your MCIT classes. You probably don't know what your PennID is because you don't have a physical Penn Card. And often times, you're digging through slack or emails to find links that are important for an MCIT Online student.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we've built MCIT Portal - "a lightweight and intuitive Chrome extension for all your MCIT Online needs".

                    A lot of caffeine and chrome documentation. We've built the front end with HTML and CSS and the back-end with JavaScript and Chrome API's.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Jorge is a consultant by training; and Kelvin comes from a data analysis background. We both ran into these challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                            UI Design
                        </strong>
                        : We knew the UI / UX would make or break this project. We spent a lot of time thinking about this and went through several revisions of what the end goal would look like. We learned a lot about placement, fonts, and contrasting colors this way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Learning web development
                        </strong>
                        : We both had zero experience with web development. While we both had to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quickly, we decided early on that Jorge would be responsible for the front-end and Kelvin would be responsible for the back-end. Thankfully, the concepts we've learned in 591 was enough to accomplish this!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Chrome API
                        </strong>
                        : We both had limited experience working with APIs in general. Additionally, Chrome extensions are very particular with how the HTML / CSS / JavaScript is written. There was a lot of trial and error to get everything working.

                    <li>
                        We both started the hackathon with zero knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, we can confidently say that we are capable of building basic websites and / or chrome extensions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We genuinely believe this project will be useful for many students, and encourage all of you to use it! We're proud to have created software which is meant to be used, and not just for a hackathon showcase.
