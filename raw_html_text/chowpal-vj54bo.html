                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing the website on a mobile device while it was running locally on one of our computers. For secuirity reasons we are not allowed to stream video footage from our mobile phone to the laptop our server was running on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to do optical image recognition on various menu's we found throughout the city. We are then able to provide additional information that is not provided in the menu, including images and nutritional information (when possible).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also able to recommend the food we believe you would most likely enjoy from the menu. This would automatically filter out dishes that do not meet a users dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to do simple augmented reality and optical image recognition in browsers. 
How to create algorithms in order to make the best recomendations.

                <h2>
                    What's next for ChowPal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to host it on a server in order for it to be accessed by any phone or computer. We need to get more users in order for our recomendation algorithms to improve.
