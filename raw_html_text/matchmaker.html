                    As makers, we all have projects we want to build, but not necessarily all the skills and resources needed to make them happen. What happens if an app can connect you to hundreds of other makers with other skill sets? MakerMatch connects inventors and creators across the city and matches them to others who are in need of these specific skills for their projects. Users have profiles on which they can showcase their skills or post the projects they are currently working on and the help they are looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the maker network to schools across the city and eventually connect professionals across the country.
