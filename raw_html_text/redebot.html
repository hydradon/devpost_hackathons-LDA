                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As CS students, we find that the current way to ask for help from CPs at SAL is very disorganized and chaotic. We wanted to make a helper application that allows students to not only see what the estimated wait time is, but to also see the queue in crowd-sourced real time. Currently, the queues for classes at SAL are often sprawled out on a piece of paper or all over the board. Also, as CS students, we find it very tedious to calculate grades because the blackboard letter grade is often not scaled towards the syllabus and un-curved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app simply makes it so the line at SAL is displayed clearly. Additionally, students can request a reservation with CPs, because sometimes the wait times are very long. The students can see which CP is there, and also see CP profiles where students can give CPs ratings. We have a grade calculator that weights assignments for each CS class, and scales it according to the curve. The students current standing in the class is displayed clearly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used QT for the front-end of the application, and we used C++ for all of the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we were stuck on how to organize students and cps, and whether or not we should have two classes or one inherited class. Also, we found it difficult to organize the weight of different assignment and midterms of many classes, because every class has a different amount of assignment, labs or midterms. Also, scheduling the times between users and cps and checking that two users don't schedule the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a visual representation of most of the main features that we want to be available. We have the make reservation function, ability to create new students and add new classes, and calculate grades for the classes we accounted for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement too many features when we started, so we were unable to accomplish some of the things that we initially planned to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Redebot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish connect the backend functions to the front-end display. Ability to parse a class's syllabus to see their weight and number of assignments. Then we can create the fill in for students to enter their grade for each assignment/midterm. Ability to notify students if a CP's office hours change. Students can be alerted for specific CPs. Also, CPs can rate students and students can rate CPs. We plan to make this into a web-app and a phone app. We made our QT application in a way that it mimics a phone app.
