                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are musicians and we wanted an app to find other musicians to play with.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's purpose is to connect musicians that search for the same criteria: instrument, preferred music genre, and skill level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built two separate versions, one for iOS and one for Android. We used Firebase to create a database of users and their musical interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was our lack of inexperience with all platforms we used, particularly Firebase, and trying to learn as much about them as possible within the time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the UI and aesthetic of the iOS version as well as how close we came to finishing the Firebase database on the Android version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Xcode to code the iOS version in Swift as well as how to use Android Studio to build the Android version. We also learned a fair amount of integrating Firebase with Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JamSession
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After fully implementing Firebase in both the Android and iOS versions of the app and cleaning the UI, our goal is perfect the search engine and eventually add a new page for venues that want bands to preform there.
