                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love memes and wanted to incorporate something that I love into another one of my interests...computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a meme generator and joke generator. Pulling randomly from the bank of memes and jokes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java script on CodeHS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never coded in java script before so learning a new language was an interesting challenge. But with all things considered I am proud of the end result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that it runs and that we managed to create something that is both funny and also functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that sometimes even though something is a struggle and is very unfamiliar it can be rewarding to make something that I can see myself using in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Funniest App Ever
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe an update with memes of different categories and options that include user input. Download the app Expo and scan the QR code for the full user experience. Team members: Razan and friends.
