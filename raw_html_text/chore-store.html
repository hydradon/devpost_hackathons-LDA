                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from identifying and understanding the struggle of being in a low income situation. Having additional forms of income by selling your services when you're available could be a great way to help those in this scenario. Additionally, if you have disposable income, you can buy the services to free up additional time for yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create listings to buy and sell specific services on a competitive marketplace such as Lawn mowing, Laundry, Babysitting, Car Washing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React Native,  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Expo.io and Visual Studio Code we created a phone application front-end. For the back-end we used Facebook's login API, JavaScript and React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of documentation and experience with new frameworks we're our largest challenges throughout this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the front end and branding that we created. More than anything we are most proud of what we were able to create with the limited knowledge of the frameworks going into this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that persistence is key.  Without it this project would not have been created. It was incredibly difficult to get everything to work together correctly, but it was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for chore.store
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue to develop our project together moving forward with the intentions of releasing an alpha to college campuses initially and scaling up to larger locations as seen fit.
