                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The long and awful time it takes to complete a purchase or complete shopping in a mart or shopping complex due to the queuing time and the time it takes to log items purchased by the customers as it can make the customer bored or tired and change the mart he/she is using thus destroying user-client relationship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses a QR scanner and NFC to tag and get items, adding them to the shopping list but before then the user would  be assigned a unique code or ID that makes sure the shopping cart or information isn't leaked or tampered with and the data sent to the client or store. the service then makes sure the user has flexibility in terms of shopping and can use the NFC reader to pay or checkout if using an NFC enabled mobile device.  it can also use an online payment service to pay the fee as per the shopping. after payment, the customer then moves to the counter to identify items and the number based on the info of the payment and is cleared.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using the react-native slack with some in-built libraries and external modules to integrate the NFC, code scanner and the payment option. certain design inspirations were gotten from dribble but the main integration as by using a core library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile phones that will be able to completely use all features and also the NFC and the payment part were limited by a very large margin and that brought about thinking about

                    What's next for Lula
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the market to other markets to increase coverage by a very large margin and to improve on making things faster and easier and if possible remove the interactions of a counter to monitor customer shopping.
