                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you want to play drums but you have no money!! DruMyo solves that!! Play drums anywhere using 2 Myo Armbands
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using 2 Myo Armbands, raise and lower your arms in specific zones to play different drum sounds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the software using the Myo SDK and IrrKlang sound engine. Myo Armbands were used to get raw pitch, yaw and roll.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to do  piano which would require EMG raw data. We first used the Android SDK but found out halfway through that it did not provide raw EMG sensor data. We then had to switch to the Windows C++ SDK. However, recognizing a pattern from EMG data was particularly hard so we changed to creating an invisible drum set using pitch roll and yaw. 
Another challenge we ran into was including the SDK into our project, we ran into many linking issues.
Figuring the mathematical offset for the yaw zones (to change the sound)
                </p>

                    It's dope!!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some of us, we further deepened our knowledge of the C++ linking process (what lib, dll and includes are)
Some of us learned C++ for the first time.

                    What's next for DruMyo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Move it to Android since it is possible to get pitch, yaw and roll.
