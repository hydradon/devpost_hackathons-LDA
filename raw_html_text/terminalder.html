                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be fun to access tinder from the command line
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this port allows the user to view profiles and swipe on tinder
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we utilized python, with requests, and queried tinder's endpoint which had sparse documentation by people on github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    since it wasn't well documented, we had to find out through trial and error what worked and what didn't when requesting the endpoints. We were going to input similarity scores for bios but were unable to since bios are rarely filled. We were also going to add messaging capabilities but were unable to due to the fact that its hard to find the IDs of people you have matched
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use requests (maxim, victor), dealing with state machines in python(nikola), making a complete app by the end of a hackathon (all of us)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Terminalder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add more functionality in way of displaying images or messaging if the API is better documented or we find other endpoints
                </p>
