                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project that can help others. We were brainstorming and we were thinking how hard it would be to get accustomed to life without eyesight. Our name originates from the optics related to the eye being replaced by audio, hence the name Auptics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A sensor attaches to someone's foot or ankle and senses obstacles in front of it. When it senses an object (within four inches) that the person can potentially trip on, another sensor will beep, alerting the user to watch their step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gathered the senses needed for the project and attached them to an Intel Edison board. We then programmed the sensors to gather the input and execute the command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time downloading the correct software needed for the program to run. Afterward, the code had several errors, but we slowly altered the code to get our final working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we ran into problems we tried to think outside the box and not give up. In addition, we collaborated and came up with efficient solutions in order to pass the obstacles we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there is always a solution to a problem, we just have to work together to solve it. We also gained a valuable experience on working on projects under a time crunch and solving real-life projects so that they work efficiently and effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Auptics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our product and work to build an efficient device that users can easily wear and use. We hope that this can be a tool used by many blind people around the world to ease them into life without their eyesight.
