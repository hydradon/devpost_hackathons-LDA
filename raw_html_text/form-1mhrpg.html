                    MEET YOUR WORST FEARS, REVISIT YOUR BEST MEMORIES, EXPERIENCE ALL THE FEELS. your brainwave frequencies resonate with all sorts of mind states. the emotions you consciously + subconsciously experience will take form as particles with materials, sounds, and personalities to touch, throw, stretch, and pop. this is our ultimate mental health + wellness playground. the positive, the negative. love it. play with it. crush it. throw it across the room.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the power of emotions, the things that make us humans. We want to create a collective environment to see, touch, share, and ultimately actualize and form our emotions from realtime brainwave frequencies that translate into unique colors, materials, and particles before our very eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a dire need to revolutionize how we view mental health today. We wanted to de-stigmatize mental health by showing the world at the Hackathon that our emotions which naturally radiate from each of us are beautiful. Uniquely, we looked to create an experience that&rsquo;s impactful and meaningful by witnessing our own emotions emit before us from our very brain&mdash; and we are beyond ecstatic to announce that we have made FORM., the first mental health and wellness playground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Magic Leap and the Muse brain sensing headband, FORM turns your emotions into sentient particle creatures, which you can then play with or let soak in like paint into the surfaces around you. At the end of the experience, everyone's emotions will be saved along with the room, to be shared as one incredible collaborative spatial art piece.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Getting data from the Muse headband to the Magic Leap was a tricky process since it hasn't been done before. Luckily our audio mastermind Daniel worked with the Muse previoWe learned so much about the physical body, brainwaves, and how they interface with the human experience. It was amazing to learn about different brain states and their roles in our everyday lives, and how they serve as a metadata layer of our physical subconscious. In addition, we shared insightful conversations about vulnerability and openness in regards to emotions, and environments where we've felt encouraged to share, or inhibited to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the technical side, we learned a lot about working with Magic Leap in Unity (as it was many of our first experiences with the device), and about using OSC (open sound control) as a data source for real-time bio-metric control wireless-ly between devices. There were also many small victories and "wow" moments we shared with each other through our diverse skill sets during the process.usly and came up with a great solution using OSC.

                    We feel proud to use the Muse headband and Magic Leap AR headset to help users empathize with themselves and others by creating art together with their EEG signals.

                    What's next for FORM. for Magic Leap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There will be a mass, consumer-friendly iteration of Magic Leap within our lifetime. No longer bound to just a room-scale experience, this future device will be enabled by the AR cloud to create meshes of the physical world. With geo-localization of spatial information, FORM. allows its users to express their emotional states in the real world on an individual level -as well as in collaboration with others. The experience of FORM. has dual intentions: therapeutic effect &amp; creative outlet. There is a therapeutic effect to expressing your emotions which alleviates mental health strain, and painting is often used as a form of self-expression. As a result, a user would be able to bring their spatial computer with them to lunch, walk around in a local park, and paint their emotions -whether they are venting or reflecting.
