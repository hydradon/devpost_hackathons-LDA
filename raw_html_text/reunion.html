                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michelle Zhou from the team loses her possessions frequently. We wanted to create a platform on which people like Michelle could reclaim their lost possessions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays two things: a list of items people have lost, and a list of items people have found. One can not only search through these lost and found items, but can also make posts about newly lost or found items. These items are also grouped by location lost or found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask in order to do the back-end programming of the web app in Python; we used HTML and CSS to display everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All members of the team were inexperienced going into this hackathon, as it was the first for each of us. None of us had any past experience with web development, so we had to learn everything as we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no experience, we learned a ton of material in order to create even a simple web application. All of us are extremely proud of the knowledge we've gained within the past 36 hours. We also worked well as a team and were efficient in splitting up tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basic web development, including how to program using HTML and CSS. We also learned how to render templates through Flask and thus link our HTML code to functions we wrote in Python. Furthermore, we became a little more experienced with GitHub and how to work on the same code at the same time from different computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reunion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, at least the concept behind Reunion will take off and become an international platform. Of course, what we have developed during this hackathon is only a basic skeleton of what Reunion could potentially become, and as each of us become more versed in web development, we will of course come back to this idea and improve it.
