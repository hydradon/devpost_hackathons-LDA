                    A Rest API to play Mastermind

                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this challenge we were asked to develop a server side API to play Mastermind (
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)" rel="nofollow">
                        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)
                    </a>
                    ) against.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to design and develop a robust, well tested and scalable solution, and in order to achieve those features with productivity, I have chosen to use Java and Spring-Boot.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The API
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The API is a simple REST API, with two resources: Game and Guess.
With the first resource it is possible to post a new Game, informing user and number of players, and to post a new User into a Game, when it is a multiplayer game.
With the Guess resource it is possible to post a new Guess.
All operations return a Game Status object, with the game key, which identifies the game.
                </p>

                    Instructions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The API was developed as a self contained application that can be deployed to a container or executed locally.
The Maven build will create a Jar file. To run the application just use java -jar command on mastermind-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Final Considerations
                </h3>
                <p>
                    1 - What was the hardest part?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardest part for me was to manage the time to finish everything I had planed. I wanted my solution to be professional and truly functional, in the sense that you can really play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2 - If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try to find a team way before the event date and start planning really early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3 - If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the multiplayer game play could be a little bit better explained.
