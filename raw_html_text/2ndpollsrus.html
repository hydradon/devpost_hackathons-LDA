                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for an idea so we decided to poll in our room. BOOM! IDEA!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to respond to polls and look at polls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Node.js in order to make the application, and split up based on our talents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with manipulating Android Studio and learning how to use it at first, since most of us had no experience with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up the database for questions and user data, along with post gets and put requests for the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about basic app development and making databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2ndPollsRUs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we learn to better implement this, we could actually turn this into an actual app.
