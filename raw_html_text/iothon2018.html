                    We are just started to study and want to learn something new an we thaught, a hackathon is a great oportunity to get an insigth in todays comuter science. We had a few ideas and we tried to realize one of it. So we worked on "Simple Personalized Home Automation". We didn't yet have the coding skills to finish our aproach to the project. But we worked out a concept of user profiles that make the experience of a full automated house more individual.
The last two days were interesting and we learned a lot.
