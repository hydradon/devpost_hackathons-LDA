                    Cloud Klosett is an android app that allows the user to either take/upload photos of their wardrobe, we then use computer vision to cluster the items by categories.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android studio, we used Google Cloud Vision to scan the images, Google Calendars api to allow the scheduling of outfits, and we used the mindworks library to develop the closet deck, as well as many other tools

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>

                    We plan to add a feature to alert the user when they have neglected to wear an item for a period of time and give them options to either donate or post item for sale to Let Go as well as a calendar to estimate your future laundry date, as well as a
