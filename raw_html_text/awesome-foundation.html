                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the dean of a chapter of the Awesome Foundation I wanted a way to get the word out about all of the awesome projects that are being funded by the foundation every single day. The stories of these projects are so compelling I knew that the voice-enabled Alexa ecosystem would be a great way to showcase them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill fetches the projects from the Awesome Foundation's website and reads the description back, displaying any images that are associated with that project. You can step through projects one at a time, or you can ask for a random project. You can also get more information about the Awesome Foundation itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built using node.js and Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Awesome Foundation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add some interactivity so people can learn more about the chapters near them and learn how to apply to get their own grants.
