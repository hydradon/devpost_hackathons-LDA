                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the election coming up, we believed it is important that people are able to be informed in a way that is unbiased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to find out what senators they are most similar to based on how they voted on bills and motions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python, flask, bootstrap, jquery, html5, css3, javascript, beautiful soup, jinja, and sqllite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are first time hackers, and many of us learned python and flask for the first time. We are proud that we were able to come up with something working within the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARGUS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Email notifications for extra functions and dealing with misrepresented bills. We also would like to come up with a much better similarity score system that is more functional for people to use.
