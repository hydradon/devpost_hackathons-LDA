                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on smart watches and home automation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Happy Lifestyle product is a wearable piece of technology (similar to apple watches or fitbits) that track your basic vital statistics and your current location as well as adjust your homes' A/C, dehumidifiers, and other appliances based upon this data. Our project is designed to make life seem easier and allow for better relaxation. The sensors on the watch will be able to gather an approximate temperature and process it with other data. Our prototype uses LEDs to demonstrate temperature recognition and display it visually.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Arduino and and Java. We coded the Arduino to react with these certain commands and trigger a response. The RPi was integrated with the Arduino which we at first tried to do though Java but that fell apart after technical issues.  For the web development portion of the project, we used complicated html5 and css3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we were planning on working with Ark.io because of the potential applications of the Ark.io platform , but we soon realized that the data we were working with was hard to integrate and above our coding level. When we decided on Happy Lifestyle Tech, learning the Arduino language was a challenge-- only two of our team members were able to code with C languages which the Arduino language is based on. Actually, getting the Arduino to understand the data sent by the RPi was one of the most frustrating problems. Only after hardcoding a designated response we were able to get some sort of result. There was
                    <strong>
                        also
                    </strong>
                    the difficulty of not having the right sensors and sufficient wiring. Though in the end we made it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Way we developed simple code into complex command to create something that could help society within the next few years if it was up to scale. Even if the primordial design is very basic and limited the future applications could be a larger and more promising venture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new ways to utilize languages and troubleshoot issues that confounded the group we were able to persist.
                </p>

                    What's next for Happy Lifestyle Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Happy Lifestyle Tech the potential future is limitless in where we could expand this project to. With potential integration to large Home Automation programs Happy Lifestyle Tech is a project flourishing with potential.
