                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a group of friends that have always enjoyed challenging ourselves. We grew inspiration from a website called the human benchmark, but we wanted to take a more enjoyable approach to things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is simply a memorization game where one views a pixel image for 10 seconds to memorize it. After this 10 second timer they need to recreate the pixel art and have the bot mark its accuracy.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it into a web browser using HTML/CSS/JS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A difficult challenge we ran into was the main algorithm to compare the user's drawing and the original picture. We aimed for efficiency to keep a fast interaction with the user.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the teamwork established with each other through the little time we had. This was my first hackathon and team project and I believe it was a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I played a more front-end role in this project, it allowed me to learn more about back-end as I communicated with other members of the group.

                <h2>
                    What's next for PIXELIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for PIXELIT is to be hosted online to play with friends. Allowing a group to test their memory and artistic abilities against each other. This will be done through the utilization of socket io.
