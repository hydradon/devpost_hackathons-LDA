                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to optimize and maximize the learning potential within a university environment by allowing students to submit questions and submit feedback to the professor in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow instructors to gauge their teaching and receive feedback in real-time to adjust to the student's needs. Students can submit questions that everyone in the class can see and "up-vote" a popular question to gain priority in receiving a verbal answer from the professor. If a certain question exceeds a certain amount of up-votes, then the professor would be notified to address the question(s). These questions are stored in lecture sessions that are identified by dates and the course and can be reviewed in the future, even after the lecture ends.

                    How we built it

                    Java in Android Studio

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The scope of the project was ambitious for the amount of time we were given
                    <br>
                    Several team members were not familiar with Android Studio
                    <br>
                    Firebase was entirely new to all team members and posed a challenge to set up and use correctly
                    <br>
                    Merging code between UI and business logic
                    <br>
                    Overlapping workflow and implementation

                <p>
                    A semi-working project that has a decently implemented UI
                    <br>
                    Better understanding of the applications and limitations of Firebase
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase and its differences to traditional databases
                    <br>
                    Android studio and it's associated tools for mobile application development
                    <br>
                    Merge code well before the deadline
                    <br>
                    Set a foundation or ground rules for implementation of the requirements

                    Correctly implemented with a polished UI
                    <br>
                    Switch to a more appropriate database tool
                    <br>
                    Consider Xamarin for cross-platform development
