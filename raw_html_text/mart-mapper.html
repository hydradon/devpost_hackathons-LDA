                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having worked in a grocery store and interacting with people everyday that ask questions about the location of specific food products, we decided to utilize the Smart Pantry API to make Mart Mapper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses the functionality of Smart Pantry to organize your food at home or at work, but adds considerably to the Shopping List. Listed here are the products that the user has ran out of. Instead of just a simple checklist, we found a need to integrate a store map. Based off of the product and the store, our app will determine where in the store you items are located. This contributes to pain free shopping for the customer and less wasted hours for the workers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pulled the API from GitHub and opened it in Android Studio. We analyzed the code and started modifying parts. We added some different pages and tinkered with the layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were multiple instances where we were unable to edit certain aspects of the API due to the code being a higher level to our understanding and the way the contents were protected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of our first Hackathon, our goal was to create a useful application. Even if it ended up being basic, the goal was to make it work. At the end of the day, we created a functioning application that, if continued to be worked upon, could be used in retail today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that thinking small is the key. We had so many different ideas that would make this app even better than it already is, but for our level of knowledge, some of those ideas fell short. This wasted some time, but it was valuable to learn from our mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mart Mapper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will ask around and pitch our idea to different companies to see if there is any interest of this in the marketplace. If so, we will continue to develop and make our 24 hour project into a business.
