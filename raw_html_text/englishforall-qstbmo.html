                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us have experiences with the struggles of ESL speakers, whether it be from family or strangers. We hope to incorporate them into our lives by creating a website that will help them communicate better and be more involved in their community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a speech to text recognition of words and allows the speaker to pass when their pronunciation becomes understandable by Google's speech to text services. On the other hand, if the speaker does not pass, we used Google's text to speech services to teach them the correct pronunciation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by learning about Google's Platform Services, then, after successfully implementing those, we created a domain and a GUI. Then, we connected the two pieces with node.js and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning node.js, Google Cloud Platform's services, and handling the stress of a 24-hour hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to incorporate many things we didn't know before - specifically node.js, website building, and Google services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that websites can be built based on a hidden node.js server and displayed with an HTML file. We also learned about the extent that Google and other companies have incorporated AI and ML into their services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EnglishForAll
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand to different languages and accents using Google's vast translation library and extend the size of our own libraries. We also hope to give a more personalized and unique experience with user profiles and better interfacing.
