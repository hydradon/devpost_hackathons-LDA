                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women are severely underrepresented in tech, and our team wanted to make a tool that would enable women to enter the field.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                <p>
                    We struggled with the technical code due to our lack of coding experience.
