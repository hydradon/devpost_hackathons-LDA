                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brian, Tanzeela, and I all have 19 P. The stress of checking swipes, checking menu, and trying to exchange swipes from all three different web browser is annoying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three basic functions: 
Buy &amp; sell swipes in real time
Check dinning hall menu
Check how many swipes would keep you on the right track
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used  Android Studio and Java!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is illegal to sell swipes. Thus, this app emphasizes that students "donate" swipes to fellow Bruins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a app on a idea! That is pretty cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is harder than we thought, but with good food and friends, anything is possible! We can swype to that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swype Right
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our app by including functions where students' can input their weight goals, calorie intake, so that they can eat at the dinning hall that would allow them to reach their calorie intake.
