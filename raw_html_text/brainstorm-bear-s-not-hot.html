                <p>
                    Our team was originally going to stay in our comfort zone and build a web application to help people pick which restaurants to eat at, but instead decided to try something less familiar. We ended up challenging ourselves by learning basic game development on the spot and managed to build this simple educational platformer.

                    The Brainstorm Bear is just like your typical

                    but instead of aimlessly jumping around we implemented our boxes to supply random words of a certain category to the player. The goal is to

                <p>
                    Everything was built from scratch using
                    <strong>
                        C#
                    </strong>
                    and

                        Unity
                    </strong>
                    . The graphical elements were drawn by hand using
                    <strong>
                        GIMP
                    </strong>

                    Using Unity with C# for the first time caused a lot of headaches due to beginner mistakes.
