                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heavy traffic in the city of Toronto and interest in self-driving cars
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web app that simulates ideal scenario with self-driving cars and collision aversion. User can control how many cars are generated and specify in how many seconds they are generated with sliders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, our laptops, some pen and paper and a chalkboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult as many of us were new to JS and random generation was difficult to accomplish with the several different elements like the roads. The algorithms for driving was made difficult due to the random factor. It took a long time to get user controlled aspects of the UI to work. The collision aversion algorithm was very complex so it also took a long time. Getting everyone's parts to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we learned from the experience and made something that works (kinda)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JS and working together as a team.

                <p>
                    Reworking the entire thing if we ever touch it again
