                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TheBlueMan was inspired to create a dynamic and interactive style of teaching to better introduce the basics of coding to children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps children learn programming by presenting simple programming concepts in a game-like way. The Blue Man picks up blocks of code (in order) that form a complete if-else statement at the end of the game. The game ends when all the blocks are collected and the correct code displays on the page, or the code is incorrect and the page displays an error statement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript for our canvas, HTML for our web page, and CSS for styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The crash between the character and the obstacles were hard to code, as well as the movements of the character after the collision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we worked to improve the user interface of the game. The design of the canvas, along with the HTML text and motion of the character, matched well, which brings focus to our user interface design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design and programming with JavaScript, working with movement and collisions, collaborating with Git
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TheBlueMan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could improve by introducing a game theory, which would be useful when there are more puzzles, and more obstacles and coding blocks to organize and randomize. We could create puzzles of different difficulty levels to allow for a wider target audience and broader syllabus.
