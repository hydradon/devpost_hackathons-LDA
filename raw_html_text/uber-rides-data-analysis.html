We want you to explore the Uber ride data set and come up with new trends or find anomalies. You&rsquo;re allowed to use other datasets to supplement this analysis. We&rsquo;ve added some additional resources for datasets that you can use, but you&rsquo;re not limited to only these resources. You can supplement it with whatever datasets that you find! After you finish your analysis, we want you to visualize it. Show us what you&rsquo;ve found."

                    , I wanted to see what sort of insights I could uncover using Uber's ride data. I had an awesome time exploring this dataset during a midnight coding binge. If given even more time, I would have really enjoyed taking a deeper dive into this analysis!

                    The Data
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to data privacy concerns, many valuable features were dropped from the dataset. This left very little room for exploration. The methods I use in this project are great for working with data that can be described by a connected graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dataset contains many data points but very few features to work with (~4 million rows and 7 features). The features being source id, destination id, hour-of-day, arithmetic mean travel time, geometric mean travel time, arithmetic standard deviation, and geometric standard deviation. These geometric/arithmetic pairs are heavily correlated, so it is only beneficial to keep one. Leaving me with 5 usable features for this analysis.
