                <p>
                    Open AGI targets RISE Applicants for Short Term Installments Loans.
Applicant Data allows for the Open AGI to create its own models for user input.
Intuition is developed through the trends between inputs.
Determines a Risk Factor of the Applicant as it accumulates multiple user entries.

                    AGI Purpose
Filter applicants based on higher Risk Factor.
Reduce workload and efficiency for Elevate Employees.
 Allow further implementations in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program is designed to:
Allow the AGI to recognize data trends.
Access the Risk Factor of the Client.
Prevent Fraudulent and Invalid Entries.

                    Thus, the program data is simulated for the sake of demonstration purposes.

                <p>
                    We were unable to   properly parse our Typeform API to get the user input 
We used the org.json.simple library and realized that it doesn't have the proper function calls to implement our JSON data
