                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackKings 2.0 is so hyped up that each batch of tickets has been selling out within an extremely small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kings Bot is a Eventbrite bot that constantly reloads the HackKings ticket page until tickets become available. Then it reserves a ticket for you to finish filling out the registration forms.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially tried to use a headless Nodejs web crawler module but then realised I actually needed an api. Then switched to a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never made a chrome extension before. Also, since the HackKings ticket page went up, Eventbrite have decided to change their ui and class/id naming conventions along with it so testing was quite hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a chrome extension. Also Eventbrite has really bad bot protection. I must have refreshed that one page at least 10,000 times over the past 24 hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for Kings Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it work for any Eventbrite ticket page!
