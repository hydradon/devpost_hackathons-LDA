                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A project I am passionate about from another class that has inspired me to make a way for students to reach out.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website has a dynamic navigation bar that takes users through different pages that provide them with information on mental health resources.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Html, Css, and Javascript to make a dynamic and visually appealing website.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a person who has little experience in coding it was all a bit of a struggle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to make a website that looked good and was easy to use.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot abut combining javascript, css, and html.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to add more information and make it more personalizable for people in need.
