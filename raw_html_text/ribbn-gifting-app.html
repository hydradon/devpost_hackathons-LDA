                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Built using C# and the Ring Central Text API's

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I wanted to accomplish more but was limited help availability. Also had some hard time translating and utilizing the Glip API.

                <p>
                    Happy I was able to get the authentication and text message API going. I had some challenges at first but by being diligent and continuing to work hard I was able to get something going.
