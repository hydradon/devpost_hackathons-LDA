                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanted to try and see what we could do with HTML, and to have a simple destination for Cattracks routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you schedules for the Cattracks Bus routes available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using html, and by basically trying out best to learn aspects regarding HTML at the same time, we wanted to give it good asthetics and have it be a simple one stop shop for all cattracks schedules, which we did by embedding PDFs onto the page itsself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the challenges we ran into were just trying to get used to HTML for the most part, we're all beginners at this, and just wanted to learn something new. Another roadblock we ran into was trying to incorporate Isaac's Java code into the webapp, but we had no idea on how to incorporate the Java code into HTML and I'd say that was probably one of the biggest obstacles we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we got the webapp to work for the most part, and it looks nice enough for something made by beginners
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some of the basics of HTML, such as design, embedding PDFs, using hyperlinks, and so on.  We also learned the difficulties of coding and how to get past difficult complications involved in the process of making projects such as this one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cattracks unofficial WebApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully it becomes a pet project and we're able to modify it more as time goes on and as we learn more about HTML and its capabilities. For now though, it was a great intro to the world of html.
