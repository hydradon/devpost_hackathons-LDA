                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As JIRA user and JIRA administrator I have always wanted some kind of notification when a JIRA issue was updated without checking my mail. I spend a lot of time in the view issue page in JIRA and issue notifications are vital to me. I want to respond fast to my customers. I do hope that I can help JIRA users with my add-on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Issue Notifier will display JIRA issue notifications on the view issue page in JIRA in a simple and discrete list. JIRA issue updates are displayed almost instantly to the notification list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with the Atlassian SDK and my knowledge about the JIRA ecosystem. I read a lot of articles in the Atlassian developer section in order to make sure that I would follow all guidelines and thereby build a quality add-on to JIRA. I had some help designing the logo. So a good friend of mine helped me designing the logo

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing data was a bit tricky so a lot of test code was written to assert and verify data storage. Delivering good performance is vital to any application so most of the development time was dedicated to making the add-on perform well and being useful to JIRA users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simple structure of the Java classes in the project and the many unit and integration tests that I wrote. Delivering well tested product to a customer is something that I do care about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the JIRA core framework. Really enjoyed working with Atlassian SDK.
                </p>

                    What's next for Issue Notifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would really like to create a nice and simple way to display the changes that a JIRA user makes to an issue when the issue is displayed in the list. A minified issue change view.
