                    The web application parses data from various Job Search APIs in order to provide and match the most relevant data to a Veteran's job search query. We identified that veterans have unique needs and concerns when looking for employment, and created forms that allow Veterans to input pertinent data, such as military rank/paygrade. The application translates this data to a more traditional job search query and pulls the jobs that match the query and also provide relevant information for veterans. In doing so, making the job search overall less daunting for veterans.
