                <p>
                    Craigslist (and many other sites) are used to buy/sell sex and many times these people selling sex are used for sex trafficking.

                        We would setup a fake ad with a phone number for the perpetrator to call or text.   Once they contact us, we will then start to have a database of those buying sex.  We can then educate them (or scare them) about the realities of Sex Trafficking.  We could use Twilio for the telephony communication and Whitepages API to get further details of the perpetrator.

                            We would setup a fake ad with a phone number for the person to call or text.  Once they contact us, we will then start to have a database of those who are being trafficked or who are close to that doorstep.  We could then contact back these people with statistics/information about Sex Trafficking and how to get resources or help.

                                Comments:  We just need to be cautious about communicating back to people who have their phone monitored by those who are trafficking them.
