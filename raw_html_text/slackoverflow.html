                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slack is the go to messaging channel for developers and Stackoverflow is the go to Q&amp;A platform for developers with lots of questions. So we decided why not bring Stackoverflow into Slack?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The slackoverflow bot is a Slack app/bot that returns you the most voted answer to your question on stackoverflow. It'll reply the complete stackoverflow answer to you along with the link, so you don't have to open a new tab and navigate to the question url. We figured that if you ever wanted to spend time looking around for multiple answers, you might as well just open a new tab and go to stackoverflow. However, that might also be an additional feature we can add to our bot in the feature.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a python wrapper around the Slack API client. To get the stackoverflow question and answer, we utilized the stackexchange API along with an open source google search api (not supported by google).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we were only going to use the stackexchange API for getting the answer. However, it wasn't long before we realize how irrelevant some of the search results were. We saw that google search results led to more relevant search results, so we used google for searching instead.

                <p>
                    The bot is working and deployed. Hopefully the integration process for the bot should be very simple for other Slack teams.
