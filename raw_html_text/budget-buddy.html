                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the project came from Central-South America and the deep cultural roots that lie there. There is a process that occurs among the lower class women in Central-South America that my group discovered, and we used it as a basis for how to build our app to help people. High school and college students have the same needs as the women who developed this wonderful system, and we decided to create a beautiful high-tech experience to the system to make the user experience flawless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, users organize themselves into groups. Next, they will decide a value to put into the "pot" as well as a recurring time to draw and input money to the "pot". The app handles the organization, money transfers, and makes the whole process seamless for the user to help their friends save some money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Swift 3 for iOS as well as Google Firebase for the backend database service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Firebase was a big challenge for us, as nobody had experience with using firebase at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Firebase, having a team of 4 beginners make a successful app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work in a team better, how to pitch an app and how much research we had to do in terms of the market of the app to make a successful pitch.
                </p>

                    What's next for Budget Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finish building out the app and setting up a Stripe API for payments to occur to route the user's pot money to our account, which we'll use to invest on a large scale in mutual funds to profit, and then pay out the users' money when the time comes using our recurring funds from other customers.
