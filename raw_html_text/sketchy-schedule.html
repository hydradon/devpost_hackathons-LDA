                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an idea for a hackathon so this seemed both challenging and fun.

                    We built it completely in Python using lists.

                <p>
                    A few challenges we ran into were placing the assignments and activities in free spaces and checking for already filled spots.
