                <p>
                    Based on the tagline, it's probably clear that National Treasure was a huge influence on this project. This classic masterpiece took the American history that we learned and revealed a intertwining story hidden behind its most famous artifacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to emulate the experience of solving puzzles and discovering hidden pieces of history for visitors of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA). The PMA has a beautiful collection of American artwork and we wanted to build a story around these pieces. We also wanted to create a story that could scale to multiple adventures throughout various galleries or even the entire museum!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When evaluating technologies, we felt that augmented reality (AR) was a perfect fit for this experience. This allows our users to be fully immersed in the game while still enjoying the wonderful collection of curated artwork around them.

                    In this game, you'll be given clues that lead you to paintings, where you'll find another clue that leads to...yep, you guessed it, another painting. The clues range from puzzling riddles to clever limericks. When you "solve" the clue and find the painting, you'll scan it using the AR-T. Your next clue might be written in invisible ink or layered behind the painting - all of which the AR-T is capable of processing. You win the game after scanning the final painting, revealing a secret of The Artists.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built AR-T using Unity and ARToolkit, since we had experience using both. We extracted unique features from each piece of artwork allowing the AR library to distinguish them. Then we designed the UI and workflows and imported them into our Unity project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To weave our story, we researched paintings (aka. reading gallery labels and Wikipedia) that were available to us. An Elasticsearch index and Kibana dashboard made navigating the information a breeze. Our goal was to find artists that were linked historically, crafting a narrative and brainstorming clues that linked American artists working in Philadelphia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then devised clues that linked each painting together using different AR effects and iterated on them based on feedback from our friends. Finally we play-tested our game with random strangers in the museum, which gave us some great ideas on improving the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest is history (and magic).

                    We had a hard time getting a cross-platform iBeacon library to work in Unity. Our original plan was to use the location data to keep users in the right area, as a clue (think radioactivity locator), and to dynamically load AR data based on the closest galleries. Though, in the end, we decided it wasn't critical.

                    Oh and time. We lost track of that really quickly.

                    Over the course of the project we brainstormed a ton of ideas, but didn't have time to implement them all. Here's some of our favorites:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        More adventures! We would love to make more adventures that features paintings in the Eurpoean section of the museum. We could also try out some interesting AR overlays in the modern galleries, where it would be more realistic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Different difficulties and time lengths. This goes along with the previous, in that a variety of adventure types would allow visitors to Choose Their Own Adventure&trade;  based on their preferences and time constraints in the museum.

                    <li>
                        Enable scanning for more paintings in the museum. We proved this was possible for every painting we had data for, but took it out for performance reasons. We have a few tricks up our sleeve to optimize this, though.

                    After the hackathon, Joe and Nick will continue to be BFFs. We'll be on the lookout for opportunities to share our creative vision, as long as we can shamelessly promote our favorite movies. This hackathon was a great experience for us to work together outside of work and network with the Philly tech scene, so I'm sure we'll try another one.
