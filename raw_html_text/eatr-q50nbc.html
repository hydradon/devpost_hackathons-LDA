                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eatr serves as a food log for users to track what they are eating and the app then creates recipe recommendations to users based upon the remaining carbs, protein, fats and calories that are needed for the remainder of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was coded in Objective C for iOS.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eating is a complex process and we creating a system to interpret this information to simple words is difficult.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Application development is hard. Also
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eatr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We foresee this app becoming more complex overtime with the ability to understand your taste preferences, the ability to aid you in reaching your health goals and ultimately learn more about being a more proactive Eatr.
