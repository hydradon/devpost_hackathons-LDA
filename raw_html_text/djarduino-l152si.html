                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the launchpad
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays a smalls election of 8 bit songs and can produce various tones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior experience with some research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sd cards, .wav files, and every other failed project we had this weekend. The count is at about 4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something that works and we gained experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino's are fun sometimes. We learned more C++ and programming embedded systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DJArduinooa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand this input board to have more inputs. We want to be able to change the buzzer sounds to .wav files so we can have better audio quality for creating music.
