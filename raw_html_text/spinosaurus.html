                    SlothSure is an Arduino project that detects changes in orientation at the shoulders to determine if the back of the user is slouching, and alerts them to fix their posture. It also keeps track of the number of times the user attempts to slouch in a predetermined duration of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the observation that people typically slouch while sitting at a desk/table. This bad habit can be detrimental for long term help effects, and constant back pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good posture is linked with better health, and having confidence. SlothSure ensures that the user is notified when they are slouching in order to correct their posture. When the session is ended by the user, they are able to see the changes in posture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SlothSure wants to provide the user an experience that creates awareness of their current posture habits, and encourages them to improve it.
