                    Despite the plethora of online restaurant reviews today, there are not many places that list which places are safe to eat and which places have practiced food safety violations. This is despite the scariness and deadliness of many foodborne illness outbreaks. SafeEats aims to change that by providing an easy-to-use resource for people to find out which places (in New York City, for the moment) have had health and safety violations in recent years.
