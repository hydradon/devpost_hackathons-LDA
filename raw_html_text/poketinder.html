                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometime life is too easy. Tinder especially so. We aim to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Tinder recommends potential matches for you, instead of swiping right away, you have to fight for your right to swipe!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tinder's API is private, but still accessible. We developed our own REST-based applikation on top of it, to track your wins and losses. The API runs on node.is on an AWS EC2 instance, and the battlelogs are stored in a DynamoDB table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement push-notifications, but that turned out to be more cumbersome than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually made a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make an iOS app in Swift. That's cool.
