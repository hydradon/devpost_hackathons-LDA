                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the idea of education in mind, we decided to create a small game using Unity and C# in order to teach the basic principles of recycling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended with Recycle Road, a small game that is fun and helps teach children the basics of recycling to be better for the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recycle Road is a side scroll game that functions similarly to Space Invaders and Frogger. The player, a recycling truck, scrolls left and right to collect the various recyclable items while avoiding the trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recycle Road was built using Unity, and C# for our scripting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, very few of us were actually familiar with using Unity and scripting in C#. Given this obstacle, we had the challenge of having to learn the basics of the IDE and language while simultaneously using our newly obtained knowledge to make headway on the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This proved to be difficult both in terms of planning and time, as we had to learn as we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to adapt to a new IDE and language so quickly with the allocated time. As well as being able to get through the hurdles presented to us in the forms of bugs in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, how to loop our program to make the basis of the game, making sure the obstacles are randomly spawned, and keeping the score and timer up to date in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recycle Road
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more efficient menu system for when the game ends, and perhaps some more components when considering speed, obstacles, and a more advanced scoring system.
