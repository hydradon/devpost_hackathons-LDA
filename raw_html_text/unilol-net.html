                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love university and we love League of Legends. Our group met each other with a passion for the online strategy game League of Legends and we wanted to create a platform that made it easier for college students to find other League of Legends players in their school and see how they compare in the rankings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website will allow League of Legends players enrolled in university to register and link their ranking in to a leaderboard specific to the school they are attending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split in to groups of two, two on the front end, and two on the backend. We also communicated between each other and gave input as we were working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties with some syntax of libraries and languages we were not familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well as a team for our first hackathon. We also finished the prototype of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned front and back-end programming with Node, Angular, Express, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the Riot-Games API.
We learned how to efficiently utilize third-party resources such as some open-source algorithms or functionality.
We learned how to work as a team by distributing work in a productive manner and handling it through a repository.
                </p>
