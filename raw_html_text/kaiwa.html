                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to use technology to do good for others. Given the state of technology, I realized we can make it easy for deaf people to communicate with others by using speech to text, and text to speech (not yet implemented in app)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does speech to text in real time on camera view. This way, people can look at other person's face as he/she speaks. Doing so allow deaf people to have similar experience to actually having a conversation with many others
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used swift mostly. I also wanted to integrate firebase and store information necessary on real time database, but time did not allow..
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presenting camera view was more challenging that I thought originally.

                <p>
                    Well, it works!!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with a neat way to make network layer. Too bad, I did not have time to actually implement those...
