                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 of our developers already are familiar with Muse and its possible applications. Since we wanted to do something closely related to data signal processing, we decided to go for an app that would use brainwaves to do so.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyses brainwaves to give the user their concentration, arousal, and stress levels in real time on a specific time they are doing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using mainly Ionic and Angular 7. We also used Cordova to use the native functions of the phone. The back-end was made using Flask with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to use  Uri Shaked librairies to connect the muse to the bluetooth device (see here: urish.org). We ran into other issues with databases and Flask, but that was mostly due to our inexperience with these technologies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely proud that we did not give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are also very proud that we got the opportunity to learn all these new technologies in such a short period of time. We had to work on our adaptability as a team and I am glad we did it.

                <h2>
                    What's next for BCI Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future for BCI Connect would be to become a useful not only for the users, but also the city to get to know their citizens' needs. As for the users, they would be able to actively measure their concentrations on specific tasks.
