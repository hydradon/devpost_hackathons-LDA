                    A common theme amongst disruptive technologies is going against the grain, so we decided to make a Chrome Extension that would fundamentally change the way we experience YouTube videos.

                    We&rsquo;re proud of having built a chrome extension that is changing the world as we know it. Not only does it provide a great interface for censoring data, but it suggests videos that are less explicit than others! We look forward to having you take a look at our project.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Microsoft media/cognitive services and how to make chrome extensions. It was incredible feat! We also learned about team work and delegating tasks to build a final product.

                    We used the Media Services from Azure to obtain granular speech-to-text and the Sentiment Analysis to generate the sentiment gradient.

                    Building this app was the most exciting part of our lives! Here are the steps we used to build Bleep AI
Built a chrome extension that embedded javascript on the pages that we wanted.
Developed a backend that downloaded the video processed it (in python and flask) , and served it to the frontend
We also created a caching store using cosmosdb, so that we don&rsquo;t have to do unnecessary processing.
To perform Ml calculations we used the Media Services API from Azure to obtain granular speech-to-text and the Sentiment Analysis API to generate the sentiment gradient visualization right below the video.

                    What&rsquo;s next for Bleep AI:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We plan to add custom ML models to detect further forms of explicit content or even harassment or racism. Also, we want to add ways to visualize the explicit content of videos
