                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a few of us had a background in freelance photography, we experienced the challenges associated with marketing and brand recognition and wanted to try and come up with an alternative rather than promoting on Facebook, an extremely saturated market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Mobile app allows freelancers to sign up and create a profile and also allows a potential contractor to view, swipe and message these freelancers, quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilised React Native for the Front End and Firebase for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Messaging &amp; swipe features; Setting up profiles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swipe, messaging feature. Learning React Native in 1 day. Learning Firebase in 1 day. We basically learnt how to do everything at the hack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native, Project Planning, Project Marketing, Pitching, Database Design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for S&eacute;ance Photo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to commercialise S&eacute;ance Photo and implement a tiered membership system. We would also like to expand our services and be able to support other states and countries and implement new features such as ratings and improve on the UI.
