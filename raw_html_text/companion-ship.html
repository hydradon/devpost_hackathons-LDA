                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to improve the cruise experience by allowing them to communicate before hand and facilitate communication during for a better customer experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website demos what the app does, which is allow users to log in and have a unique opportunity to make friends for their trip before stepping foot on the cruise. It also has a feed that allows the users to post status updates and for announcements to be made. It suggests other users based on the interest of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was built using Wix. The app was built using Android Studios, mostly using xml layouts and then embedding javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a ton of problems with the Android Studios emulator and library dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we got as far as we did. This was a first for the majority of us making a website and an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create and design a website using Wix. We learned javascript. We learned how to use android studios  and how much goes into making an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Companion-Ship
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After Wix adds the feature to create user profiles, we will be able to use the website just like the app. We will also look into adding more options and features.
