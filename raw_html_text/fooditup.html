                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As university students, we struggle with balancing our school live and finances with our health and well-being. We were uninformed about the importance of nutrition on a daily basis, and found it difficult to make the most out of the resources we had at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FoodItUp allows users to input and import the ingredients they have at hand, and find recipes that best match what is currently available to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed FoodItUp as a mobile app using Flutter and Dart for the user interface, and used node, express, and MongoDB for the backend. MongoAtlas was used to host the database remotely, and Google Cloud was used to run our backend processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many small mistakes, and unexpected difficulties working with balancing the tech stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make use of open source data, and tailored it toward our needs. We were also able to host everything remotely, and properly integrate the frontend and the backend of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google Cloud and MongoAtlas for hosting our applications and services. We also learned more about the general tech stack, from the front to the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FoodItUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate more personalization for users, to accommodate for those who have stricter dietary restrictions. We also want to make healthy eating a more fun experience, by introducing a 'Friend system' that will motivate friend groups to focus on healthy living.
