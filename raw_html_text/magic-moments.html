                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is to help disabled people to feel more included in today's society, because we think there aren't enough places designed for their needs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic Moments it's an app that pretends to ease the way disabled people live in Mexico. This app functions with the GPS location of the people and locations that use it, it helps disabled people to find hotels, restaurants and activities that fulfill their needs. For example if a blind person is looking for a restaurant with menus in braile this app will help them find a restaurant near them, this restaurants near them will provide information like how good their service is, if the food is good, the directions of the restaurant, etc.
The information of the hotels, restaurants and activities are provided with reviews made by the users.
