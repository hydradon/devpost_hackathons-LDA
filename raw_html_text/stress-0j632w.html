                </h1>
                <p>
                    Stress was built at HackUTD with the purpose of putting a monetary value on your tasks, such that the higher the priority of a task, the more money it would cost you. Not doing those tasks would take money to your bank account to punish you for not doing your tasks. The intention is to get the user to slack less using this strategy.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In need of a more effective application that incentivized completion of tasks, we built this web application to do just that with something college students typically lack, money.

                    Team
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Hannah Ramirez built the frontend from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abrar Anway built the backend server using Java and the Spark Java Framework, which povided a RESTful API which stored all the tasks the user would have, the functionality of which was tested through Postman The initial intention with data storage was using SQL, but was changed for using simple data structures to save on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Terry Nicks learned JavaScript and AngularJS for the purpose of connecting the backend and frontend together through REST, but we were all unable to get the connection working in time due to our unfamiliarity with it.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What went wrong and what we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The team's lack of familiarity with a client and server side website is the biggest hurdle we had. Abrar had never programmed for the backend before, Hannah was new with Bootstrap and all of its features, and Terry was new to programming languages outside of C++. For each of us, we took on a challenge where we learned something new and completely unfamiliar to us. Abrar learned a lot about backend development, Hannah learned about frontend web development, and this being his first hackathon, Terry got to learn Javascript and AngularJS through 8 hours of YouTube videos on the topics.
