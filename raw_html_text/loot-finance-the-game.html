                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a young adult, I felt like I wasn't educated alot about the importance of saving for my future. I was very financially irresponsible. Now that I'm older, I feel like through this app, we can help better the youth of America, by educating about the importance of saving for their financial future and for their future selves as they continue to grow up and learn. Our main source of inspiration and idea, came from TRANSAMERICA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This amazing, revolutionary, mobile game, all thanks to the inspiration from TRANSAMERICA-- is aimed towards children between the ages of 10-15 years old! When you're a young kid, sometimes you receive money from your parents as an allowance. But lately, kids these days aren't aware of the benefits of saving and investing for their future selfes. The purpose of this mobile game is to grab kids' attention and make them aware of the amazing benefits they can get from saving a portion of their allowance each time, as opposed to going out and spending evey penny on the latest XBOX, Playstiation, and other video games. The unique play style and colorful design will have 100% of their attention. They will have tons of fun putting hours into playing this game, as well as promoting good fanancial habits at a young age. That way, they can surely invest in their future and succeed financially and as a good person! Thanks again, to TRANSAMERICA, for giving us the idea and drive for creating this ultimate game.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the UNITY game engine, to put together the game. We also used C# to write some of the scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using the UNITY game engine, as well as developing my first mobile game. Also, this was my first time learning the basics of C#, the programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete this game from scratch, we were able to reach all our planned objectives, as well as come up with a colorful design for the app, all in a matter of 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how versatile UNITY as a game engine is, and the awesome power of its capabilities in creating whatever comes to your imagination. We learned the difficulty and the perseverance it takes in order to debug a mobile game, as well as the hard work, sweat, and tears that came from dedicating hours of work and lost sleep into developing this amazing game. Thanks again to TRANSAMERICA.

                    What's next for Loot &amp; Finance: The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding the core gameplay of this game. We are thinking about planning on adding different game modes and levels in order to increase the playability of our app. Also we can work with TRANSAMERICA, in order to obtain accurate and helpful financial advice for young adults. That way we can better educate them on saving for tomorrow through our mobile game. Look forward to our release on iOs and Android in the future!! Thanks again to TRANSAMERICA for serving as our inspiration for developing this game.
