                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a human,we can do art which computer can hard to show the complicated emotions inside. 
Human can hold the same essential theme and spirit via many different art forms, but can not easily transfer from one form to the other, if they didn't have skills. But the computer can do this interesting transfer! We make the application which can easily transfer the sketch drawing into the emotion-related song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make the application which can easily transfer the sketch drawing into the emotion-related song.For those people who can&rsquo;t see well, they can draw the picture and listen the music which can give them the fun of drawing.
Showing a great interaction between human and computer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emotions can be expressed as colors and positions in a paintings(ex, dark color shows unhappy , drawing in the bottom side means down mood).
We seperate the whole painting in to boxes which used for detecting and save them in nested array. detect where is the painting and transfer the painting into the nested array for computer, with the information of the time, position, the valid chord,the emotion,and the key.
