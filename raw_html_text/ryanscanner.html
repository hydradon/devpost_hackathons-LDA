                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Travelling around Europe this summer, I noticed it was often cheaper to fly to an intermediate destination and then on again on a low-cost-carrier when the fare direct was often more expensive and on a full service airline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In particular, Ryanscanner uses Ryanair's dense point-to-point network, but scans other large LCCs in turn if that doens't yield any results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Skyscanner API (great sponsor), and PHP (sorry).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So it turns out the Skyscanner API isn't friends with Ryanair, although these are displayed on their site, which was disappointing as this is not documented. Ryanair's route structure was a large inspiration for the project. However, the company seems to have a progressive attitude to tech, so hopefully this will be resolved in the future.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the Skyscanner API! I've never been the guy on the project dealing with an API this complex and so it was good fun getting to grips with it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I improved my workflow by using Postman for a lot of the testing phases. I decided to do the project in PHP instead of Python as it's a language I've used longer (and I think I appreciated this in the middle of the night..) but next time I'd like to move to Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ryanscanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to match up connecting flights better, and present them in a sorted list. I'd also like to be able to select airports more intelligently, as this would improve loading time.
                </p>
