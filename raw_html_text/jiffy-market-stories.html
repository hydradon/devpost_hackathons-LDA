                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have computer science backgrounds and none of us were really into keeping track of stocks.  In order to solve this problem, we wanted to make the experience more interactive and appealing to millennial audiences through the use of GIFs to tell its story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user opens the app, takes a picture of a company's logo, and the company's brand name will be recognized.  Then, the application searches for that company's stock, analyzes the text for several articles (up to 5) in the past few months that mentioned the performance (rise or fall) of the stock and reasoning behind it.  The keywords obtained from these articles are used to look up related GIFs in Giphy's API and text from the articles' key sentences is overlayed on top of the GIFs.  The user can then swipe through these GIFs to quickly, easy, and more interactively read about a stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we had to use several APIs.  The first we thought of was Google's Cloud Vision API to recognize company logos.  Then, we knew we needed both Giphy's API to find related GIFs and Nasdaq's API to locate a company's stock and related news about its performance.  To connect all of these together, we used Python and Flask on the backend and ReactJS on the frontend with Expo to deploy to both Android and iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea had to be scrapped because we had no access to a Hololens.  Because of this, we didn't have an idea for the first 10 hours and were left behind.  Then, there were challenges with the APIs to pick out the correct keywords in order to search for GIFs relating to the company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dan learned how to create a full on Python backend using Flask while Zac and James were able to successfully build out a UI and connect to the necessary APIs, all of which were new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all of the APIs that were mentioned beforehand.  In addition, we learned how to connect a ReactJS frontend to a Python backend, both of which were relatively new concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jiffy Market Stories
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could tell stories with objects other than stocks to encourage younger audiences to jump into less appealing concepts such as banking, education, and books.
