                    We were inspired to create this hack because we want to help people learn to read and write braille in order to be able to help and assist those who are blind.  Our program accepts user input as plain text and outputs the braille translations of the users' input.  We built this by taking in user input, running it through a bunch of if statements and a single for loop in order to output the braille translations of the inputted characters.  As relatively new programmers, we had to learn a lot, including how to use python, in order to create our program.  Eventually, we were able to run our code and have successful translations which we were very proud of.  Overall, I learned a lot about programming in Python as well as some braille as well.  In the future, we would like to be able to take our program and use a braille printer in order to print out the translations so that blind people can read them.
