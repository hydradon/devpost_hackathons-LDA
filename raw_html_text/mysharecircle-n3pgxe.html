                <p>
                    With the advent of technology, interpersonal communication has become as difficult as ever. One commonly overlooked element of communication is nuance, and with the adoption of each new method of communication, something is lost along the way. With the rising popularity of the telephone and  voice becoming a major way to communicate, we've lost the nuance of body language. With text message we've lost voice, and with it, the nuances used to establish tone. Communication has suffered as a result, as the new generation scrambles to find new ways to deliver the same tone through text devices. This could be detrimental for our relationships moving forward as the miscommunication of our tone can lead to misunderstandings. Our project proposes a way to objectively evaluate the score of a comment to determine whether the tone is overall positive or negative, and in this vain, we've developed a chat room to allow users to communicate while letting the users visually see the potential misinterpretation of their comments.
