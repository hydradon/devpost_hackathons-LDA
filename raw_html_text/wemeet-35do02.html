                    At the push of a button, automatically transcribes multiparty conversations, recognizing individual users and using AI and Cloud technology to extract insights and view them in an interactive tool.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined numerous pretrained ML models from Azure with additional training for dynamic users and context.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new frameworks, deciding what features were important and what was practical to build in the time. Designing our interface to be user friendly as possibly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a number of moving parts, and did not start connecting them until afternoon of day 2. It was not until very late last night we even had a presentable demo. This was a big accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The power of pretrained models which, despite having some drawbacks, are extremely quick to set up and offer a surprising number of features.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will meet again. Our code runs partially in the cloud and partially locally, but we would like to deploy the entire system onto a server so that we can show other people what we built.
