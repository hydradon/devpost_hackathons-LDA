                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the ever increasing population in developing nations, it is becoming extremely difficult to efficiently manage our resources. Some of the problems we face everyday are pollution, excessive traffic levels, which makes it impossible for us to navigate with ease. This brings us to the need of smart cities, where resources are utilized in the most effective way as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, setting up the infrastructure for  smart cities incurs a lot of expenditure. Our idea is to use the existing street lights infrastructure, convert them into smart nodes to capture vital data across the city, which can help us manage cities efficiently.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each street light is considered as a node and a graph is maintained in the backend to keep track of a street light's adjacent nodes. Master-Slave architecture has been implemented minimized the cost. In real-world master and slave can communicate with each other via PLC (Power Line Communication). This drastically reduces the infrastructure cost.  Traffic intensity is monitored using the network of sensors. The data is analyzed to effectively route traffic and other resources.
