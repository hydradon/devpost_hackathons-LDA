                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With no previous experience building a Chrome extension, we decided to have fun with the project and complete an actual extension for the hackathon. We wanted to enable users to protect their browsing history from snooping parents, boyfriends, girlfriends, sibling, etc. without the user having to browse on incognito. What we came up with is better than any of us expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time a user tries to access the Chrome browser's browsing history, they are prompted with an image and required to put in a password to access their browsing history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we ran out of time and were unable to create a backend to support password verification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud at the fact that we were able to actually create a and deploy a working Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a large portion of the Javascript language as well as JSON, HTML, andCSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to eventually build the password capability and refine key elements such as allowing the user to customize the image and the history page.
