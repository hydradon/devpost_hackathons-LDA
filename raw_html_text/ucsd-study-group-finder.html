                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research shows that studying with your peers fosters learning and conceptual understanding and encourages creative thinking. From our first year experience, we found that it's hard to make friends in classes at UCSD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app solves that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app matches people who are in the same classes and then by unique algorithms that match study preferences, including time of day and location.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an IOS app, so we primarily used Swift to make it. For the backend and database, we used Google's Firebase. We used Google Drawing tool to create a raw framework of our UI/UX.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time Hackers, we ran into many challenges in the last 36 hours. Learning about databases from scratch how to link Firebase and retrieve data on both server and client ends, efficiently, was probably one of the bigger challenges

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    To produce our very first working app! Spending

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical skills like Database structures, skills like how to distribute labor within all the team mates and how to collaborate and communicate with everyone efficiently.

                    What's next for UCSD Study Group Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would implement a location feature idea. We came up with this idea in the very beginning while we were thinking of projects to do. We want to use the geographic and location preferences from each student to create an algorithm that can make study group connections
