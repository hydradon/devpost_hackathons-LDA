                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read in the hackathon problem statement that some homeless people could travel a long way to a homeless shelter just to find out that it was full. We thought that with a well written web app, homeless shelters should be able to better coordinate with each other and communicate vacancies to the people in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app will allow homeless shelters to login and see how many beds they have open as well as the open beds of the nearest similar homeless shelter that accepts the same demographic. This will allow them to know immediately if they can take more people in or if they can't, where they can send them. 
Another important feature of this app is that it allows the homeless shelters to access a database of all homeless people that come through any one of the homeless shelters in the network, as well as update and edit this database. This will prevent each shelter from having to create all new paper work for each person. 
Because of this database, a homeless shelter can "transfer" a person to another shelter and the recipiant shelter will have full access to the transfered person's file. The web app will automatically update the database when a transfer occurs.
