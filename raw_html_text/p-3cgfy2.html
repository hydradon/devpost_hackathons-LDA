                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meg has an unhealthy relationship with emojis, and does the facial expression whenever she wants to send one. We realized that facial expression detection could be a cool way to quickly send emojis to your friends while on your laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laptop camera translates facial expressions into emojis. If it finds a facial expression that it can recognize, it matches it up with the appropriate emoji and sends it to one of your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Clarifai API to train a model on different facial expressions, and built a macOS applications that sends keyboard strokes to the Messages app based on the output from Clarifai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>- Training a prediction model to recognize small differences such as a wink was difficult, but we were able to tackle more distinct actions like :P
- Emojis aren&rsquo;t keyboard strokes, how do we send that info to the Messages app if it only has a private API?
- How do we create an appropriately sized bitmap to create an image we can send to the Clarifai API?
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to do some low-level system calls stuff to send the appropriate data, never done that in application development before which was pretty cool. Learned what a bitmap was, and got to apply some machine learning concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also rewrote the Clarifai client for macOS, we&rsquo;ll submit a pull request for that soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How video data is actually represented, some of the application aspects of machine learning, how to do some low-level calls in Objective-C, how to do server-side work in Objective-C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for :P
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The emoji recognition is cute, but it would be really cool if we could control our whole laptop session with gestures. We already implemented a dictation trigger, but it would awesome to train a model to recognize gestures to open up applications, navigate to the appropriate conversation in Messages, send a message, etc.
