                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed blogs like The Art of Manliness and books on manhood. When I heard about this contest, I thought I could make a simple alexa skill that would read off some manly life hacks that I had learned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you ask Alexa to open Manly Life Hacks, it reads one off from a huge list that I compiled. It could be about anything, from food to dress to survival. It could even be about ninjas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the AWS Lambda service to run the code upon request. It fetches its info from a private api built on Laravel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging trying to learn how all the AWS resources fit together, plus having never built an Alexa skill before was new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like it's simplicity and the nice aesthetic touches I added, especially to the Echo Show interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how AWS works and a few interesting things about Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Manly Life Hacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm mostly going to add more content. Finding content for this skill was super fun!
