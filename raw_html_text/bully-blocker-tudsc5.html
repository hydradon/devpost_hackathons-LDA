                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cyber bullying is a worldwide issue that is hard to contain and/or eradicate.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to give admins a leg up when going through the process of sifting through and blocking posts that encourage or include negative behavior. This system involves a database that stores keywords that would be alarming to the owner or admin of a website. We also took into consideration the words that could have a double meaning. In this case, we have a separate statement that will use the words that follow to truly see if the user should be flagged. All alarming data that is collected by our system will be sent via our website to the user for them to take further action.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html to create the skeleton of our website. Afterwards we used python to create the database of keywords. To present what the final product will look like. We used  wireframe.cc to give an example of the sign-in process, and what we project a user profile to look like.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While thinking of ideas we had an issue with coming up with an idea that didn't take an admins power, but instead helped it. We also had an issue creating a wireframe because we couldn't find good enough software.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of  how well the keyword database was made in such a short amount of time. I'm also proud of how well the website outline came out.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a wireframe and how to add depth to our thinking.

                    What's next for Bully Blocker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next I believe that Bully Blocker to be able to scan photos for unwanted content. It could also be able to scan a site/app for spam or scammers, which is very useful to the user.
