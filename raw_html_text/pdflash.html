                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It really comes from my mom. She is an accountant and every day she has to fill out a lot of PDF forms and with that is some editing software with unnecessary built-in tools and very slow. She told me about it last year and till now I find the perfect time to fix that harsh reality.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, you drag a PDF file you want to fill out in the program. The program will then analyzed how many questions you have to fill out and ask you in ordered questions. When you finished answering the questions, the PDF is filled out.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of technical problems happen in this seemingly simple program. I get to process the image and build an OCR.
