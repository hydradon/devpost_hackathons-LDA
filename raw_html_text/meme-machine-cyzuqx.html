                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my friends are passionate about our memes as they enlighten our moods every day. We wanted to share some of that joy with everyone else.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are teaching our robot to dab, bottle flip (to its best ability), summer salt (which took six hours to work out -_-) and do a few little dances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a kit from Ez Robot that we assembled and made a bunch of servo movement sequences in order to get it to do these fancy moves.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge were facing right now is trying to get the servos to move fast enough to flip a bottle. Also challenging is balancing the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the summer salt we were able to get the robot to do. This was extremely difficult as the neck servo on the robot is broken, so it can use its head for momentum, we had to make it so that the legs could have enough momentum alone to carry the whole bot over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that not all problems can be faced head on. With the bottle flip and the summer salt, our original plan didn't work out like we planned, but we learned to adapt and overcome the setbacks and we were able to do our best and be very happy with the outcome.

                    This is our first hackathon, at the time of writing this, it's only 12:30, but so far this has been one of the most fun experiences we've had in our lives. We all look forward to going to more hackathons in the future!
