                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I live in Loma Linda and there is a crossroad near my neighborhood which only has one stop sign on one direction. Everyday it is very dangerous for me to drive pass that crossroad as cars from the direction without stop sign usually drive really fast. I always want to send a comment to Loma Linda city about this, but without a handy and convenient tool, I would always forget about this after passing that crossroad. So, a platform which could allow citizens provide faster and cleaner location-based feedback in a convenient way is a win-win to both community and citizens.
