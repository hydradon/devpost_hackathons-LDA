                    Inspiration: We wanted to evolve Siri into a memorization game, but the Amazon Echos ran out, so we decided to code in IOS.

                    What it does:
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                    It allows users to create their own memorization games in the convenience of their hands.

                <h2>
                    How we built it: Sweat, tears and a whole lot of help. It was our first time coding in swift, so it was a learning experience for all of us. The format was clean, but intricate as well.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Since it was our first Hackathon, we came across difficulties with brain storming and coding with an unfamiliar program language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: It was certainly difficult but we are proud that completed the majority of our project!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: The basics of a new programming language and that pulling all nighters make you look 5 years older the next day.

                    What's next for QuizApp!: If given more time, we plan on implementing audio that reads the question to the user and incorporating voice recognition.
