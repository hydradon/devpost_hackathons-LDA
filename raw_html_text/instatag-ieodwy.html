                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a website that can help us improve our Instagram game. So, you can upload an image and the website will generate hashtags for you and propose an edit for the image so you don't have to do a thing. You could still edit the image in it, but there would be an AI that can propose to you the best edit to get the best of your image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually, all it does now is generate hashtags for an image. We didn't have time to do the second part of the project. :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the website we used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jquery, PHP
For the AI, we used Keras libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have enough time to train our AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to learn so many things in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Keras' library to create a neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaMaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to make the AI work properly, then make the ai for the image modifications and implement everything in the website. It would be cool that our idea can get integrated into Instagram so it's a functionality. it would help our Instagram game so much!!!
