                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maintaining several versions of a resume can sometimes be a hassle, so we thought to make an app that makes updating your information easy and allows you to quickly add or remove specific information to or from your resume based on your needs.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the first tab, you can fill out your contact information, education, work experience, and other information through a simple form. After saving that information, the next tab allows you to select which pieces of information you want on your resume and preview the resulting PDF as you work on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application is build with Node.js and React. For the UI, we used Semantic UI and Redux Form. PDF generation was done using react-pdf, which uses a React Native-like interface to layout a PDF with flexbox styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PDF styling had limited features. For example, fonts were unavailable to us. Web development can have its highs and lows, but we've identified our personal strengths through this wonderful learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing an entire project and getting to an MVP with time to sleep! There are vast spaces to improve upon this idea but we were able to bite off a sizable chunk of the meat that is this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had never used React, but we were able to get up to speed pretty quickly, thanks in part to the BookBub tech talk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resumat&eacute;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some potential updates include scraping job descriptions to automatically tailor your resume, using LinkedIn API to import your information, allowing for a greater variety of resume templates through a marketplace/workshop, more granular control of PDF style and a general expansion to overall job application tracking.
