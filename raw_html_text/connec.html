                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know we're not the only ones who are frustrated with career fairs. They are unorganized, crowded, and an awful experience for all parties involved. As technologies improve, it seems that career fairs stay the same. We sought to change that and modernize the career fair.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connec is a web application that replaces traditional lines at a career fair with an automated queuing system. Students can electronically join the queues of companies they're interested in (up to 5 at a time) and track their positions in real-time. When they are close to the front of a queue, a reminder is text-messaged to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other end, recruiters can make company queues for students to see and join. During recruitment, they are presented with a screen that tells them the student's name and the length of the queue. When they are done speaking with a student, they manually update the queue with a simple click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface of the web app was designed using Sketch. That design was converted into frontend code using the Bootstrap framework. The backend utilized Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our team's first hackathon, it was surprising how difficult it was to decide on an idea. We also had to learn a bunch of frameworks on the spot. As time ran low, we had to say farewell to some features we wanted to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're so proud of the amount of effort we put in. We didn't plan to stay up as late as we did, however, we all made sacrifices for the sake of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a multitude of frameworks like Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. We were familiarized with the frontend/backend relationship. We learned the valuable consequences of working in a team of friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connec
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add the additional features we had to cut out, such as a countdown clock to the time that career fair starts. We also want to introduce the webapp to the school's career center for possible use at a future career fair.
