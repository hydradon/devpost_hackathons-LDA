                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did not want to calculate the duration between two times manually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply calculates the duration between two times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I already had some experience writing Alexa Skills in Python, so I used it again for this simple one. Parts and experiences from previous Skills could be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to find the correct function for time calculation. After that it was easy. Another challenge when getting this ready for submission was multi-language support. I solved it now with nested dictionaries in python. Probably not the best way, but it was fast to accomplish.

                <p>
                    Maybe adding some more utterances and making everyday usage more convenient
