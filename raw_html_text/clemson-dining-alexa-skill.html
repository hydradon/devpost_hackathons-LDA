                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got tired of looking up the menu on my laptop to figure out where I wanted to eat. It just seemed like something that I shouldn't have to do in 2018, and now nobody has to.

                <p>
                    You can ask Alexa about the overall menu for a campus dining location or for just a single station at a specific location.
