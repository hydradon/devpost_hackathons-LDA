                    What is World Tune?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    World Tune is a redefined music streaming service. It is your one stop destination to listen to the most popular songs from different countries. The website automatically searches the World Wide Web for the most popular songs in different countries and update in regular intervals. It is a joint venture of Rahul Mittal (who built the front end) from Florida International University, Thor Keller (who handled the back-end) from GeorgiaTech and Jerry Chang (who designed the interface keeping in mind user experience)

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Rahul) thought that we don't have a portal dedicated to world music. Music from different countries is available, but it's not organized. So that's where we came up with the idea of creating "World Tune."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a rich user interface design, you can listen to the current top songs from different countries. The web app updates every 24 hours to refresh the songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. On the back-end, we used PHP, Java and Python to scrape the web for the most popular songs in each country. We embedded YouTube Player API to play the songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping the web was difficult until we decided to use Python instead of Java. Dynamically adding the list of songs and associating them to a link was challenging. Filtering and parsing song data and searching the relevant file on YouTube for any number of songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The songs update every 24 hours to check changes on the list of popular songs. This was my first time working in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so the styling and interactivity turned out better than expected. The design is really cool and user-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use GitHub. Learned that a project is more successful when done in collaboration with others.  Each one of us could focus on our part and make it better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World Tune
                </h2>
                <p>
                    World Tune can be expanded to include all the countries in the world. It is limited to 12 countries for now due to time constraints. It can also reflect live changes in popularity of songs and also show number of playbacks and user ratings. The music player can be customized to make more user-friendly.
