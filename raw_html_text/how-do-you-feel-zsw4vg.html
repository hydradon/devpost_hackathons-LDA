                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The side effects of certain medications can limit an individual's want to take medication. The main reason is they do not have enough knowledge in side effects they struggling with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than a medication reminder, It works with existing pharmacy information and clinics, checks on users&rsquo; satisfaction with medication, provides them information about the side effects of their medication, and gives them recommendations and info based on their experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android App for the front end for the user interaction. The backend is mostly in AWS. Lambdas are used to scrape information from PDR.net, and we use AWS's API Gateway to turn these web scrapes into an API. We also use SNS combined with Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver notifications to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How we understand the user needs and their workflows and hard to design a solution which applies to different disease. Also, different patients have different descriptions about the same side effect. The dataset for pharmacy information is really broad and hard to combine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide combined pharmacy information in a user-friendly interface to help user adhere to their medication
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the facts some patients gave up taking their medication due to the severe side effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How Do You Feel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision an end-to-end service for these users. First, users could share their side effect feelings/experience to the APP. Besides that, we will track users' meditation shopping data, which could automatically input the system. After getting the data, we could provide professional advice(PDR) to patients with side effects and clinician schedule service. Also, we help patients build habits in adhering meditation like Daily Checkin function. Building a patient group aims to guide patients give advice to each other and build trust with the APP.
