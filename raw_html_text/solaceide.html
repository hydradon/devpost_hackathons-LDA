                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There does not exist an IDE that works online like Google Doc. We want to make something using the convenience of the Solace network system that allows for live collaboration between coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much like Google Doc with dynamic edit/deletion. Each document is shared via a topic in the Solace network that allows for simulatneous collaboration between multiple individuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main code is written in Python using the Python MQTT protocol for online communication. The server is held via a Solace network service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solace network was hard to connect at first due to the restriction of school web. Took us a long time to get the correct port. Python also has a bizarre GUI system that does not cooperate well with our idea. But we managed to pull through anyway.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished such a project in only 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about networking and Solace communication.
                </p>

                    What's next for SolaceIDE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better GUI. More stabalized communiation.
