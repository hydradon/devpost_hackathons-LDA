                    Ask Alexa for Dad Jokes to have a great laugh with your friends and family.
"Dad joke" is a pejorative term used to describe a corny or predictable joke, typically a pun. Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are traditionally told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its "dagginess"
To start, just say "Alexa, launch Ultimate Dad Jokes"
At anytime, you can stop by saying "Alexa, stop"
