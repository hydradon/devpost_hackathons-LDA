                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to control our repo with voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows for hand free repo operation through voice commands.
Helps developers relax and evaluate their repo status through audio context.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a flask server to act as a restricted shell to process our commands.
Commands were parsed via AWS Lambda functions getting input from Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited time with wifi connection.
Flawed documentation for the Alexa product combined with it being a new experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa works with our spoken commands and can respond to them through voice
Our api server acts as a restricted shell to ensure overall server safety
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use flask, how to debug Alexa, and how to set up a hosted server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Git Gud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add parameterized features, which means more dynamic code in Alexa integration.
