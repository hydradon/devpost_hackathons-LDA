                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a system which connects college students to help out each other in terms of tutoring.  We noticed many websites would charge college students ridiculous amounts of money, so we decided that why not make a system where college students can help each other out and not pay a fee.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tutoring system where college students list their weaknesses and strengths and connect with other students who's strengths are their weaknesses which allow them to tutor each other, creating a symbiotic relationship between college students.
