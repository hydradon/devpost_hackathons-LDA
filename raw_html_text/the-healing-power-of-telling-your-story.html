                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many diseases are treatable but not curable. Living with such disease is an ongoing learning experience for patients and families. They share their journey to champion hope.

                <p>
                    This application is a platform giving patients and parents needed tool to share their stories and reach out to the community. There is many portals &amp; community support the same idea. However all those platforms only support local community, where patient only contact with others who talk the same language. Using AWS AI services we enhance the idea to build bigger community not limited to nation or language.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Application in current phase support 3 languages: Arabic, French &amp; English. Architect solution that can give good performance while translating user posts from his original language to the other 2 languages and how user can search using his languages in posts (from all language) and return to him immediately. This can be achieved by
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Extract keywords from the post (in case of English &amp; french or by translating Arabic post to English then extract the keywords)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Translating the post &amp; keywords to the other 2 languages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then when user inquire the timeline (or inquire based on search query), data will be retrieved quickly as translation done once while adding

                    </strong>
                    I'm very proud to do anything that can support not curable patient even if help is a small thing. In first days of disease discovery, patient want a lot of information not from Doctors but from other patient has the same disease. They want to hear from them, ask them and feel they are not alone. After while this same patient, will always feel that he wants to help new patients and give him advise and support.

                    Although AWS provide SDK and resources (for android, iOS, JS,...), but almost nothing for flutter community. So I build a flutter package
                    <strong>
                        aws_ai
                    </strong>
                    that can be used by flutter developers to integrate with AWS AI services such (Rekognition, Translation,..). This package will help flutter developer to integrate with AWS AI services easily, which means more &amp; more flutter users will use AWS AI services and generate a lot of great ideas. Package can be found

                <p>
                    It is my first flutter project, my first flutter package. First time to use AWS Translation, Comprehension &amp; Rekognition (although I didn't use rekognition in this project but I learn about it while implementing the flutter package). 
But the most challenging part for me was using
