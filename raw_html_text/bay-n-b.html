                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are just booking a skiing trip and it's super cumbersome, we tried to reinvent this process. That's why we built Bay&acute;n&acute;B.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes over the whole process of booking a trip. It suggests you an accommodation, a form of transportation and possible activities for your given preferences. You can then book those with just a few clicks.
Thus, we replace travel agencies and make the whole process of booking a trip a lot easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an IOS App which uses API&acute;s to gather information from different sources and merges them into one booking process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sadly you need for nearly all transportation companies API keys, so we were not able to connect to those in this short amount of time. Since we are just 2 team members the project size was kind of overwhelming, which is why some detail views are missing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea!! And of course we are happy about our MVP, we are going to present. It's incredible what you can built in just a few hours of coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bay&acute;n&acute;B
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bay&acute;n&acute;B should get a whole network for booking activities. Activity providers should be able to offer their services in our app and make the booking process for those a lot easier. 
User&acute;s should be able to search for all possible activities and book these with transport and accommodation in just a few clicks. The booking process should be able through Siri, to make it even easier.
A model should be trained to react to overbooking and suggest alternative destinations.
An "In-Activity-Navigation" should be added to take even more care of capacity problems: e.g. suggest a different slope or hiking path to offer the best experience.
