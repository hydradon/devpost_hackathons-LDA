                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no other ideas for the project, so we decided on this one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses websockets to connect several clients to a central server. Then, the clients can play Cards Against Humanity together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Go for the server, with
                    <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket" rel="nofollow">
                        gorilla's websocket library
                    </a>
                    . On the client, we used python with the
                    <code>
                        websocket_client
                    </code>
                    library and the
                    <code>
                        colorama
                    </code>
                    library for cross-platform colors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of bugs, especially considering the fact that multiple goroutines (threads) were writing to multiple connections, and considering that a user could leave at any time. There are still a few bugs, but I hope they can be fixed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the game itself and all of its features, I guess.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about python, websockets, concurrency (and how to avoid race conditions with Go), and stuff like that.
                </p>

                    What's next for CAH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might make it into a full game or leave it be...
