                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GSK Pharmaceuticals were seeing a solution to monitor sleep in either a mobile app or taking a separate approach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps a user by recording the audio while they sleep. The user can then view their sleep results upon waking up and adjust their lifestyle accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mobile Android application using Android Studio. We first collected audio recordings using an Async Task while the user was sleeping. Then we converted the audio recording to data that we can plug into a 3rd party graphing API to display the results accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were faced with big challenges when it came to data management. We had a metadata object which consisted of smallData objects which contained the sounds of the user. We had problems when it came to handling the data within the async task and passing it out of the async task and to the graphing API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the end product and the GUI and how sleek and user-friendly it is(very minimalistic design).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android Studio. We learned how to record audio and how to neatly organize and analyze it to produce meaningful results. We also learned a lot about background threads and data handling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sleeptracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could implement machine learning algorithms into this application where our algorithm starts to adjust to user's sleeping styles to provide them with more accurate information. One approach may be to use Google Analytics.
Could also hook it up to a database to permanently persist data so that you can sign in on multiple devices to view your sleeping data.
