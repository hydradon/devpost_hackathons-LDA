                    tried to make a whack-a-mole using HTML and JavaScript but hit a couple walls so I made a demo of the game instead. i drew all the frames by hand on my tablet hence why it took 24 hours to make a 6 second gif. had i had a team of people who could program i probably could've actually made the game, but i'm pretty happy with my gif. it looks cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    maybe by the next hackathon i'll have a better understanding of JavaScript and could turn the gif into a game.

                    so the gif has 6 screens - the title screen, 3 whack-a-trumps, a 'miss' screen, and the 'game over' screen (approximately 150 frames). you can imagine that you (the user) hit the first two trumps and then on the third you miss - so the whack-a-trump shouts 'FAKE NEWS' at you and the game ends.

                    i chose trump because i like moles and wouldn't whack them but would happily whack trump.
