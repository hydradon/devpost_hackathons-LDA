                    The amount of information we share every second through the internet is fun when you come across a funny meme or cool post from your friends. The data that each of us has to provide to the world can't be quantified, and it doesn't only serve to entertain us, but what if we utilized each other not just for meme's? Imagine what we could do with this amount of data like keeping each other safe?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application brings together the bridge between social connectivity and emergency services. By providing real-time data from firefighters, police, other emergency personal, and combining that with your own information, we are able to map the location of emergencies and disasters. Emergenteer was created for volunteers during any type of disaster and allows users to identify threats and validate each other's alerts to make sure that you are always in the loop and can keep you and your loved ones safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emergency personal will be able to view visual representations of where the threats are and the fastest ways to get to them. We appreciate the work that these people do for the safety of our society and the danger that they put themselves in. This is why we want to be able to share our data with them so they are never caught in a blind-spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join us and bring data and safety together for the better of us and our planet. Not only can volunteers and emergency personal be apart of bringing all of this together, anyone will be able to utilize the application to view and report real-time emergencies. If you support this mission, not only give us love, but help Australia as they fight terrible wildfires as thousands of people and animals have lost their home.
