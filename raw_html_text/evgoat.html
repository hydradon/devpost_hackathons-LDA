                    First things first!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You should check out our Figma mock-up :)

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some real estate website provide a "walking score", helping you understand how walkable an area is. Inspired by this easy way to compare neighborhoods, we decided to build the "EV Score" to help non-homeowners access the EV market and get the most out of their city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVGoat analyzes driving patterns to help non-homeowners figure out if they are in an area where they could use an electric vehicle instead of an internal combustion engine vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of User Interface Design, Data Analytics and Humor to provide tools for people considering buying their first EV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build several aspects of the solution in parallel, which required a lot of focus on making sure the differents parts of the system were providing a consistent user experience. The biggest challenge we faced was respecting the time frame and finding a balance between our expectations and the realm of the possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having a burn out. Staying zen at all times. Having fun during the whole challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goats can be funny. Also when working in a multi-disciplinary team, making sure everyone is in charge of a task that matches their skillset provides tremendous efficiency increase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EVGoat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to discuss with potential investors and mentors to see how we can bring EVGoat to the public.
