                    <li>
                        Lay a note on top of your laptop,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Point FLIR One + HeatReview app towards the note
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some part of banknote will be thin enough to late heat pass through quickly, so you can instantly get a image of heat region.  ( tested with Hong Kong Dollars )
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you circled that region and the heat source is good enough, the app will comment it as "Thin as bank note". ( not limited to banknote, thin paper / plastic sheets will have similar effect; but normal printer paper will block the heat )
