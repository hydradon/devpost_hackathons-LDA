                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was inspired by my own wants for a simpler personal finance app. I wanted to be able to keep track of my money without getting too muddled in specifics and take advantage of blockstacks decentralization to keep the details of the finances private.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially attempted to do this as a mobile app but due to technical difficulties switched gear to a web based interface, the platform blockstacks is best supported. Uses reactjs for all functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    mobile SDKs are in beta leading to limited documentation to learn the api and the eventual movement of the application to a web based platform
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    successfully getting the blockstack api connected to the react app and creating my first react application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    basic android development
blockstack api basics
reactjs basics
                </p>

                    flush out basic functionality and add data analytic and budgeting tools. Eventually migrate application to mobile as well.
