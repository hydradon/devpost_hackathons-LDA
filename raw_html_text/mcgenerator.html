                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were messing around with the arduino toolkit, and were getting along with it.  So, we thought of making a project that will play with the lights, and then we thought of the morse code generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project takes a string as an input, and then converts each alphabets to dit (small flash) and dash(longer flash). The space is given a larger time delay. The combinations of the alphabets create whole sentences, and then keeps on repaeating till it gets the power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino Software Environment. We took an array and put the alphabets' morse code in the string array. Then it extracts each alphabet and fetch the value from the index of that alphabet, and displays it as an output using laser light.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pin arrangement was a little problem that we came across, Rest everything was created smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                    <strong>
                        WE
                    </strong>
                    are proud that we were able to complete this project, and many other similar projects like this in 24 hours. Some other projects included are Traffic Light, Clap Buzzer, Clap Lighter, Rotatory Car, etc to name a few.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn about this language in one day, We learnt about the architecture of the arduino, and learnt about the pin arrangement of the ardunio tool kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MCGenerator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we are thinking of evolving this Generator, to a decoder too. We are thinking of using a laser light sensor, and then decoding the dits and dashs to alphabets.
