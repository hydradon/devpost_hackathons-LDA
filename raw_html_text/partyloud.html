                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many systems today harvest the potential of individual small elements to create a larger, more powerful collective product by synchronizing the inputs. We used the same concept to synchronize an audio signal across many devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It synchronizes audio signals across all connected devices.
Imagine you are at a party, a conference or an outdoor rally, by connecting to the same session on PartyLoud, you can create a speaker-like effect without the specialized hardware by using the collective of individual devices present.
