                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to take volunteering into the 21st century by creating an application that would be easily accessible to younger generations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vinder is a an app for companies and individuals to post volunteering opportunities for all ages. Opportunities in the local vicinity appear one by one, with the user being able to "swipe left" to reject it, "swipe right" to match with it, and "swipe up" for more details and logistics. We believe the simple UI will enable these opportunities to be easier found and as well as more well known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the group into two distinct teams: front end and backend, spearheaded by Team Leader Diana Chang. The front end worked with html, css, and javascript to create the layout and format the web application. The back end, worked with React, Node, Vanilla JavaScript, and Firebase  to create the functionality of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase, React, and Node are difficult to quickly pick up, and we struggled at first to incorporate them all together into the same project. Connecting it to the front end also proved difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get a working prototype out that allows users to have the full swipe functionality of the Vinder of our dreams. Of course, learning new technologies that will aid us in future development isn't half bad either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were various technologies employed to ensure the success of the Vinder project. The biggest ones were of course Node.js, React, and Firebase. In addition, we strengthened our preexisting background in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for Vinder is to implement an even more comprehensive, machine learning algorithm to determine the best kinds of volunteering for each individual use based on their swipes right or left. We have also given thought to having a medium of communication through the app for clients to communicate with potential volunteers directly.
