                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came across this Japanese water clock (
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhOYRHt2cqM" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhOYRHt2cqM
                    </a>
                    ) a long time ago that I thought it'll be cool to recreate. It could display time, words, and virtual any shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll have a tablet that people can draw in. The tablet'll send the drawing to the Aqua Iot Display, and it'll display it in real time.
