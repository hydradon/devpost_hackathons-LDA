                    <p>
                        &lt;&gt; a tremendous amount of marine debris (640k)
&lt;&gt; the marine life that is negatively affected
&lt;&gt; the natural beauty of our Charleston waterscape
&lt;&gt; our love of games, technology, data and the ability to drive real life environmental change in our community and around the world
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &lt;&gt; makes marine debris data collection easy and fun by making it into a game for both amateur and expert users
&lt;&gt; users receive points based on how much data they collect as they  encounter marine debris
&lt;&gt; as they earn more points, the user levels up and sees how they stack up against other "players"
&lt;&gt; the map allows users to verify their data entry as well as access other pertinent marine data layers to enhance their data collection methods and planning
&lt;&gt; the data that is collected is made readily available to experts such as researchers, government officials, and software developers to expand as they see fit (this would be available through a clean and easy-to use public API)

                    How we built it

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        &lt;&gt; the ionic/angular framework was built by Imee
&lt;&gt; the backend and API were created by John using node.js and mongodb
&lt;&gt; the map was developed by Emma using Esri's ArcGIS Platform technologies (including Javascript API)
&lt;&gt; the design was envisioned and constructed by Lucius
&lt;&gt; all pieces came together as a collaborative effort and wouldn't have been possible without the helpful advice of local experts, and enthusiasm/support of our Fishackathon staff

                    <p>
                        &lt;&gt; we work in different programming languages; putting our app together was tough
