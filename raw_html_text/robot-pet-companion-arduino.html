                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given increasing social stratification in Singapore, alongside an impending issue of an aging population and a busy workforce, many individuals may be increasingly solitary or have moments in which they crave a friend by their side. Our goal is to create a pet companion which can provide a form of accompaniment, especially in times of need or loneliness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Follows the owner like a dog;
Can be played with;
Smiles :) while providing light
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino kit, alongside various components like ultrasonic sensors and a small speaker, implementing code to run these devices as desired to function.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering individual components and constructing the robot from scratch;
Setting up and getting all required components, especially sensors to run normally;
Difficulties in the robot tracking the object of interest;
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually constructing something from scratch;
It beeps;
Learning to use new sensors and relevant libraries;
Correcting for errors;
Improvising and upcycling materials;
Making music;
Team bonding &lt;3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Arduino;
How to use grove libraries and new components;
New syntax;
Constructing the robot and wires connection;
How sound is made via code for the speaker;

                    What's next for Robot Pet Companion (Arduino)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better/Stronger design and more responsive and functional;
Less hard coding;
