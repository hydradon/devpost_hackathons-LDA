                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we spend hours of our lives waiting in line at stores, restaurants, and even amusement parks, we decided that waiting in lines was just too much for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QueueTime is a bot that allows users to set and find queue times of different stores. With QueueTime, users can transform time waiting in lines into time to have fun with their family and friends.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with GupShup.
