                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to have a way to gather musicians together for impromptu jam sessions. However, we realized this type of thing could be used in other ways as well, such as gathering people to play frisbee on the quad or help eat leftover food you find yourself with.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating an account, you can create events to host them, or browse all events that other users have created. Users can join any event they see fit, and will be provided information about the event in their profile.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a firebase server to handle data and host the website. By querying the database, we can add new users, see what events have been created, login, logout, etc. We used

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with javascript in general, as most of our skillsets didn't fully include the tools we ended up using. Issues of particular note were overriding functions we didn't realize existed (createEvent() is  a built in javascript function that we accidentally tried to override :( ) or issues with synchronization and server requests, like switching pages before requests could complete.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a fully functioning login/logout system, as well as the ability to create and join events. None of us had made a website anywhere close to this scale before in this timeframe, so it was really rewarding to see things come together.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate and organize databases in good ways. We also did a great job of dividing workloads towards everyone's best skillsets.

                    What's next for Assemblr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make it easier for people who join events to contact one another or actually get to locations.
Also, we want to make it a bit more presentable. 
Finally, We'd like to make a smartphone app with similar functionality.
