                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In case of time, i was thinking for simple but usefull project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It appears to reduce queues in hospitals by non-human consultation. Main case is to show a user right way to the doctor he needs, by completing simple questions' line. I think some people(i'm not an exception) goes to queue wrong doctors' door and then go to another queue. For example, my granny never been in Kosice and fall out of the stair and hit an arm, she came to the hospital but without knowledge of where surgeon is, she started searching by walking random doors, she thinks that where a queue is, there are a doctor(recepiant) she needs. And after staying in queue she got the knowledge but she needs to stay another queue again. So, i believe it will help all ages people to improve their health and improve quality of medicine.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used my knowledge about how to build an Expert System, Python3, as GUI used "tkinter" module
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We where only both, so we needed to make our program simple but useful, and the second one were my mate leaving and i must to complete the project.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I done a project like that without any knowledge about "tkinter" module, bad understanding python.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    It was my first hackathon and i learned what exactly fantastic thing it is.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Expert System for stationary machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In discussions we wanted to make this stationary machine more useful by adding ID card scanning system for getting access to Data Base of user. It may be used as registration machine to examination, status checking. It's especially useful for old-aged people who can't use smart devices or computers. And of course it will reduce queue to recepiant.
