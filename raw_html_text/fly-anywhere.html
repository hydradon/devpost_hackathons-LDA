                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone wants to travel, but it's difficult to make it convenient and cost-efficient, and it's intimidating to do the research. This project aims to remedy that with an extremely simple-to-use application.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds the cheapest flights to the USA's top 50 airports and displays them to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh man where do I even start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Expedia API actually returns prices which are lower than the ones listed on their website, and it doesn't give us a URL for the flight, so when moving from our application to their website, it becomes difficult to continue the same seamless UX. There were so many challenges. So many.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never taken on a project like this, and I've actually never used Flask period, and never used Python in a project like this. I'm also very happy with the UI of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Flask, though there is still a lot more to learn. I also learned a bit about python and how it can work as a web language, which I had never seen before.

                    What's next for Fly Anywhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Totally unsure, possibly hosting it on a domain so that people can use it.
