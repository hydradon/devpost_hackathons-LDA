                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    They say: &ldquo;The faintest ink is better than the best memory.&rdquo; In our everyday life there are so many moments where we want to take a quick note but sometimes we need to dash, sometimes the information we want to note down went by too quickly, and afterward, we&rsquo;re left wishing there was an app to turn the picture into text in just a few seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newt is an animal that can easily adapt to its environment. The app allows users to quickly note down important ideas and make quick changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newt is pronounced similarly to note (pun intended)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NewtSnap is a mobile web app that provides an efficient and simple way to take notes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes in an image (from a file or take an image) through HTML forms and it outputs a string of text that can be edited or deleted using an OCR API The notes are saved using local storage so all the notes remain there until you delete them or clear your browser history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The notes can be read out loud using responsivevoice. This allows the user to listen to their notes on the go. It can also allow visually impaired users to view their notes with ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery. The APIs used were ocrad.js and responsivevoice.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges were local storage of notes and implementing the responsivevoice.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to edit individual notes, store notes in local storage, and responsivevoice for individual notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use ocrad.js and responsivevoice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NewtSnap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keyword search, filter notes with keywords
Set event date and reminders/notifications
Note sharing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Important note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Responsivevoice only works when you enable non-secure script on chrome
Everything else works fine.
The notes can take awhile to be created on mobile (please be patient).
