                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People with visual impairments often are unable to read smaller texts, even with the aid of reading glasses. With our app we hope to be able to provide an easy way to hear words read instead of having to strain your eyes trying to make out words that are just too small or blurry to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IPNiM converts the text from the picture taken and reads out the detected
text from the picture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    using android studio and amazon web services, we created an app that takes a picture, sends it to aws and reads out the file returned.
                </p>
