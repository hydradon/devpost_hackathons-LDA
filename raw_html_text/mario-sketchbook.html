                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us had prior experience with openCV, the other had an intrigue with AR. This is the fun app that was born from this combination of thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can draw a game world with their own desired platforms and objects. The app captures their hand-drawn world and adds Mario to it! Mario can jump and run around on the drawn shapes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used openCV's Android SDK to detect the boundaries of the game word and platforms/objects within via image manipulation and contour methods. We made a physics engine for Mario to move around in the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenCV was a tricky library to work with in java, as it was originally built for lower level languages. We had a tough time finally rendering the stage in the correct orientation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having our idea come to fruition. Tying up all the difficulties we had with stage rendering and edge detection was very satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned alot about image manipulation and intricacies of openCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mario Sketchbook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some fun possibilities include: Enemies, collecting coins as an objective, different color objects having different effects on Mario, etc.
