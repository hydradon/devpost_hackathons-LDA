                    Normally, the place rating system on yelp and google map calculate the overall rating score based on the simple average. It may not an effective guidance for users especially for choosing a restaurant. We focus on looking forward a

                    rating algorithm by considering a user's personality from various aspects. From our perspective, our personalized rating score makes real sense.

                    We calculate the restaurant rating based on 9 kinds of categories such as age, interest, income, etc.

                    The method for calculation is a modified KNN algorithm we designed. Though knn is original a classifier tool, we adopt a way to achieve quantization of these categories. We assign tags based on different life aspects.
Instead of determining classifications, we quantify each tag to estimate its influence to the total rate.
For each input dataset, we find its Top-K closest training points and take their average as our recommend rate.
