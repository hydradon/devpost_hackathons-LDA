                    A video game programmer wants to program video games in Unity. He wants to find other people to work with. He hears about Lingerr from somewhere, and visits the Lingerr website from his phone (an app would've been preferred).
                </p>
                <p>
                    He opens the web app. The first page of the app asks him to sign in/sign up. This process is easy and fast, and comes in steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Register account: The first page of the app has a field for typing in email and password. There's a log-in and a register button. There's also buttons for logging in with gmail and facebook.
He presses the register button. It unveils another field for him to confirm password. He confirms and presses 'confirm'. Message says 'Account created!'
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Fill out profile:
2a. Nickname and avatar
2b. Skills (Which skills would you like to make use of)
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Overall category: graphic design / programming / product design, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Technical skills: Python / Adobe PS, Illustrator, etc. / Fusion360 / etc.

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    2c. Location and availability
    - App asks for location, and shows the user's location on map. The user can adjust this location, and use a slider to adjust the radius of a circle that decides how far away other people can be for the user to be willing to work with them. (Their town/city section will show up on profile as their location)
2d. Description
2e. Sliders (optional). (How would you best describe yourself)
- Productivity vs fun
After filling out this information, Kasper can press Publish to make his profile public and show up in 'New members'. He can at any time leave the web app and come back later, and his progress will be saved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    .3. Connecting
Now that Kasper has set up his profile. He wants to find and contact other people on the app. He can do this by looking at a map, that has blips with other people's avatars and nicknames, in their approximate location. The other option is to look at a list. If he were browsing on desktop, he could see both on one screen. 
List and blip cards:
- Nickname
- Location &amp; distance
- Category
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kasper is able to filter the people that show up by their skills/categories. He's looking for a graphic designer to make interfaces for game projects, so he selects this option, and now sees only graphic designers in his vicinity.
He can check out the profiles that show up by pressing their blips or their profile card in the list. If he finds the person interesting to work with, he can press Message to chat with them.
