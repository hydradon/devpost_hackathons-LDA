                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do some machine learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives users music recommendations based on social media posts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraped social media posts using a chrome extension, sends the data to ibm-watson tone identifier and then uses that data to give the end user ideas of what songs to listen to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up OAuth2 for Spotify and scraping web pages with chrome apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a backend was quick and easy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's very difficult to scrape data off the web as it's being inputted by the users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moodify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably not much since it needs to be re worked into something somewhat different
                </p>
