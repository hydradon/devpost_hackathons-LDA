                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -The desire to be the one behind the DJ booth
-Wanting to hear that song you've been obsessed with when you are out partying with friends
-Finding the bar or party that fits the mood you're in 
-Creating connections with others that share the same tastes in music at venues near you
-Getting rid of the need to share the aux card and having everyone at your party be able to contribute to the playlist. This also contributes to an office setting where people at work want to all play different types of music and this gives them the ability to.

                    <strong>
                        The crowd is the DJ!
                    </strong>
                    WEDJ is a platform that gives its users the ability to influence and select the on-going DJ set of the event they attend. Event hosts such as bars, nightclubs, office spaces, or any place that people gather and listen to music can now offer an interactive crowd-sourced DJ experience.  Not only can users select songs to be added to a playlist, the crowd will vote for songs on the playlist to hear it first. Instead of investing in a DJ for the establishment which could cost a lot of money, the bar could have WEDJ software and leave it up to its consumers to pick the music. WEDJ keeps nightlife places searchable, relevant and attracts the demographic that a place wants by the type of music that they play.

                <p>
                    An average nightlife establishment has a lifespan of only 18 months. It is hard to keep a bar/club relevant for owners because of the competition and the market is fickle. In order to stay relevant an establishment must keep in mind; demographics, sound and the concept.
