                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app for small business owners to track their produce's shelf-life, help them optimize their sales while reducing food waste.  This was inspired by the iTradeNetwork company challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has 3 main tabs (Produce, Notifications, All Results).  In the Produce tab, it is supposed to display a list of all the produce items that are available/retailed at a particular business.  The user can click on any produce item, which will redirect them to a page where they are shown information on the amount of produce from their last purchase, how long it has been since they received their last shipment of this particular produce, and a space for them to input how much of that particular produce has gone bad.  The notifications tab will update with reminders to the store owner of when their produce will go bad (based on average shelf-life of that particular produce and information on their last shipment).  The results tab will display a line graph with time on the x-axis and amount of produce on the y-axis, there will be one line for produce that has gone bad, one line for produce that was delivered from each particular shipment, and one line that gives a suggested/optimal amount of produce to purchase (for the store owner's future reference).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used expo and their provided template to lay out our 3 tabs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to make a button from the produce tab redirect to another page that displayed information about that particular produce.  We didn't know how to make a database in firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to change the tab names and icons, and we were able to make and display a working button on the produce tab, but we were not able to make it perform the action of switching to a different screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    react-native is hard and there are very few people who could assist us.  Its difficult to learn multiple technologies/software at once.  Javascript is difficult even with other coding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green Cart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be able to implement buttons in our app that actually redirect us to the page that we want.  Then, we would like to plot all the time vs. amount of produce information in an easy to understand way.  Finally, we would like to figure out an algorithm to send out push notifications at the correct time.
