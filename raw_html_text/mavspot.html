                    When a user's about to leave their parking spot they open up the app once they're in their car and click the "I'm leaving" button. A pointer is placed on their co-ordinates and is visible to the other users using the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For someone who's looking for a parking spot, they open up the app and they can now see the spot and head there. Whoever clicks on the button and selects "I'm on my way" instead of "That was a mistake"
can get that spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now if the user is in no hurry, they can be a good samaritan and wait till the person arrives at their co-ordinate, or they can leave and let a fight go down for the parking spot.
