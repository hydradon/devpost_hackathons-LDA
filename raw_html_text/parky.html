                    It is often frustrating for drivers to find available car park lots in the vicinity of their destinations.

                <p>
                    Our application allows drivers to be able to identify car park with available lots close to their destinations, provides them with details about the parking fees and allows them to reserve available car park lots. Once past the gantry of the specified car park, our application will guide the drivers to their reserved lots. Once the driver parks his car at his reserved lot, a sensor at the lot will be triggered and our application will start a timer, keeping track of the duration of the parking of the car. Our application also handles the payment online.
