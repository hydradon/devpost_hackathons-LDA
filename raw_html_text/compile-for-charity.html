                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration is continuously being reminded of the accelerated rate of climate change. I want to make a difference and partner with non-profits and companies to promote new technology that is more efficient and greener for the environment. Organizations, such as the Sierra Club, focus on getting America to use 100% renewable energy by 2030.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compiles code like a normal IDE or compiler and for every compile, it donates a penny to charity with a max of $10.00 per code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a website and count the pennies per compile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not get a compiler onto the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of beginning my first out of class project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned JavaScript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Compile for Charity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to contact a local non-profit and partner with them and companies on improving the code and getting it to work and import into libraries for codes.
