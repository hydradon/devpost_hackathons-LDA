                    We were inspired to work with technologies that meant we would have to spend time doing some deeper learning. Every one of our teammates, worked on an aspect of a project to optimize time yet each aspect was from an unfamiliar realm. Our first big struggle and accomplishment was getting AWS services to run with Python, and following that was the challenge of implementing flask to receive a file and extract the necessary data.
