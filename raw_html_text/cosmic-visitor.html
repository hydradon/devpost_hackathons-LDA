                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking a combination of space exploration simulators and scavenger hunts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an exploration puzzle game where the goal is to explore all of the planets in your area with the fuel you have in your spaceship. The spaceship can be controlled by thrusting forwards and rotating left and right, however steering the spaceship can be a challenge as force is applied to only one side of the ship, so you will need to skillfully dock your spaceship onto the planet surfaces. When you 'land' on a planet, you will get some fuel back to continue your journey to other planets. The fuel on each planet will vary, so plan your journey wisely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity to assemble the game, C# to code the logic, and Blender to create models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs to fix involving mathematical logic and game logistics, figuring out next steps after finishing one feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A slightly better understanding of the physics behind stellar bodies, how spaceships work. Also improved slightly on C# coding skills, using Unity, and the Blender modeling software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cosmic Visitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scoring system, ability to land in planets (including planet environments), improved models for planets, spaceships, indication of fuel on planets, adding gravitational fields, etc.
