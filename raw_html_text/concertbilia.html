                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a musician with my brothers we would often want to catch the drums sticks or picks that the musicians would throw into the audience, and we'd save anything we could from the concerts. People love having memorabilia from their favorite artists.

                    While viewing live concerts on virtual reality, you can buy items like guitars, drums, microphones, clothes, and anything else that the artists decides through the blockchain.
