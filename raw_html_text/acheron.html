                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Ludum Dare game jam is running this weekend as well.  It started last night with the theme Sacrifices must be made.  This game was made following that theme.

                    What it does
                </h2>

                    <li>
                        The idea was that there would be 3 enemy types inside the temple, followed by a final boss on the final level of the tower that would summon the 3 enemy types.  To get to the top, you had to navigate the maze of tunnels in the temple and avoid the enemies inside.

                    <li>
                        The story was that you were a Roman Soldier in 167bc(when Romans actually destroyed the temple), and you were tasked with stopping the evil that dwells there.
