                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are driven by the desire to make code open, not as large softwares or programs but as snippets that could drive experienced and novice developers to share and contribute to code without much effort. Our local developers community is young and many do not get into opensource because of the cumbersome nature of most opensource projects. We want to build confidence in these aspiring set of developers, by creating a platform where a  'hello world' code could have meaning. We also wanted to have a platform like
                    <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        wikipedia
                    </a>
                    where everyone could revise code shared by others, to ensure snippets meet the latest standards in terms of library version update ,language specs just to name a few.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform does 3 things
 Uploading code snippets
 Revising code snippets
 And sharing code snippets with other developer communities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we had a thorough brainstorm on what should be , we identified the web stack suitable for our platform, so we built our client in reactjs and application server in nodejs. We used the elasticsearch database server for better searches through the snippets documents. There was a 4days hackathon that brought us developers together to create this solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developers working on the project came from various programming backgrounds, 2 developers were into js, others in python, java, c++. For sure no one had experience with reactjs and node js, there was a though learn and code experience there. But it was fun. 
Time availability of developers, was not easy coordinating developers working under different company and having different set of engagements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud about the fact that, out of the hard labor came a baby, this platform. Passion and vision to take this to another level has grown.
An it was the first time for us getting to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned reactjs 
We learned one or two things from each other during our collaboration.
We learned we can actually turn this platform to something even better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for wikisnip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First wikisnip needs to get completed for what was basic idea.
The future of wikisnip is to collect as many snippets as possible to be able to train machine to write working program from snippets
