                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scripting in python is fun. I was up way too late. This happened.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picks pseudorandom letters and concatenates them into a url. Attempts to load each url.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With great dreariness and enjoyment.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was unable to determine how to check if webpages existed before attempting to load them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this came about between 5:30 and 6:15 of a morning, which was still a night from the day prior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep is for the weak, and Red Bull is amazing.

                <p>
                    Find a way to check if webpages exist so all pages loaded (instead of the approx 20-30% right now) that are loaded actually exist.
