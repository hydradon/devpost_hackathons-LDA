                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the speech at the opening ceremony about using our skills to help those in Detroit. We were excited to see the
                    <a href="data.detroitmi.gov" rel="nofollow">
                        wealth of data on Detroit
                    </a>
                    . We decided to combine the data of non-motorized routes in Detroit and the data of previous crimes. We want parents to know that their kids can safely walk to school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the data, it creates a weighted heat map of all previous crimes in Detroit and combines that with a map of all non-motorized routes through Detroit. Using this, users can find what the safest walking route is from one point to another, based on the heat map and existing routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio. Using the data online, we turned that into usable data to convert to a weighted heat map, by using the latitude and longitude already available online and by weighting each point based on the category of the crime, using our own weighting system. Combining that with our non-motorized routes, we used the google maps api to give users the combination of the nonmotorized routes and heatmap to use for their travels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble figuring out how to use the google maps api to find the safest route, so we instead displayed all walking routes with the heat map. We also had trouble transferring code between computers because of differing api and sdk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time using Android Development, and we took on a very ambitious project, so we are proud of all the progress we made, even if it didn't turn out like what we first had in mind. We are also proud that we were able to reach out to the Ford and Google mentors for help completing our project.

                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Development and Google APIs. We also learned about the difficulties of implementing other APIs in our code. We also learned how to turn a lot of big data into something usable to code with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Detroit SafeWalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make it so that the app can calculate the safest route itself, maybe by choosing various short  routes and seeing which ones spend the least time in bad zones, based on the heat map. This will require more research into how to use APIs and more experience with Android Studio.
