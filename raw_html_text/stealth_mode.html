                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our drive for the project was to solve the problem of accidentally liking a post on Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It removes Facebook's Like Button from all posts and comments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a Chrome Extension which uses JavaScript, JQuery, and JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time making a Chrome Extension, so we had to learn how to use the languages specified above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished it in a timely manner, considering all of the challenges we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that JavaScript can be hard and difficult language to program it at times, but once you have the patience to sit down and understand it you can really take advantage of what it has to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stealth_Mode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can use this extension for other Social Media as well as have users be able to customize it with different options. Additionally, we would like to see our idea be brought to other platforms, specifically in mobile devices.
