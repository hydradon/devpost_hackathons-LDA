                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by my love-hate relationship with JavaScript.  I'm not here to win (this time), I just /really/ wanted to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply collections on recipes and medications, and displays upon request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of coffee and sugar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team 1 disassembled at midnight, Team 2 realized at 4:00 am that I was the fifth member. (oops)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finally completed a project at a hackathon! Yay! (and solo?)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regardless of having a team or not, you can create /something/.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A R I A
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find a team and actually follow through as a group.
                </p>
