                    One of our teammates are very passionate for turtles and saving their existence. However, this is only one among multiple problems that could be solved among communities for the greater good. We also felt it would be beneficial for it to help people that are also passionate about the same or similar projects that contribute to helping people and the environment. Our program is designed to give awareness to projects one can contribute for any purpose through organizations and companies displaying them through newsfeeds and recommendations.

                        Use the agile and waterfall methodology to develop our code. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies to build our project.

                    Brainstorming ideas from the get go
The group right next to us coincidentally having the exact idea as us initially
Naming
Errors with creating the website such as methods not working, the website not looking as great as we anticipated, etc
Coming with algorithms to meet our goals with the program.
figuring out when it was a plausible time to sleep for the fate of the project

                    Enjoyed learning new languages that I plan to better myself in. 
Enjoyed teaching others 
The camaraderie we had with coming up with ideas and our attempts to make our ideas executable 
Coming up with good ideas and getting approval and gratitude from mentors
The feedback mentors gave us
The fact that I can leave the hackathon with new knowledge, better techniques for upcoming ones I plan to attend, and mistakes I can learn to not replicate

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that working with a team takes a lot of commitment and discipline with things such as with deciding a final idea, figuring out whose idea and method to solve a problem is the best.
That making mistakes is ideal (especially for a first hackathon) and it's mainly more important to learn from your struggles and things you could've done better.
