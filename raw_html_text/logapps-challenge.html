                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to take on this challenge after spending the first day failing miserably on our first mobile application idea, ChickenTinder (we're not giving up hope though--we will be developing in the near future).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project decomposes paragraphs and categorizes words in sentences of texts files (specifically the Global Differential GPS System) by their part of speech and assigns values to certain words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python, NLTK and our sanity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both of our first hackathons, and only one of us has taken a class in software development. AKA we struggled a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud when we finally figured out how to remove tabs, whitespace, and the unnecessary words/numbers (while preserving the original sentence) in order to more easily tokenize the real sentences. It excited us so much, we took a dance break. And we survived our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we utilized and delved into many lists, we realized the importance of organization and keeping track of the various lists we used, as well as the importance and benefits of good naming for functions and objects. We learned now to use the Natural Language Toolkit and how to use some of its methods. Most importantly, we learned that coding for 32 straight hours is not good for anybody. We would both recommend and not recommend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LogApps Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working on this challenge, we are interested in learning more about natural-language processing and how it is able to analyze the nuances of human language (though in a more relaxed setting).
