                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team members: 235, 236 (Best Pre-U)

                <p>
                    As an NSF, we realised how many of our friends book out and book in at the same time, especially on Friday evenings. The number of cab (Grab) rides are insane as well, leading us to think of pairing users up with other people who are going to the same destination as them. This will essentially halve the cost of a ride and makes it much more affordable to afford cab rides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Telegram, all you have to do is to tell the bot when you want to leave, where you are and where you want to go. The app will take care of the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It'll automatically pair you up with somebody in the same area (1 kilometre) as you, going to the same area as you (1 kilometre) and you two can meet at the either one of the locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these is done through Google Maps and is super simple to use! Just submit the date and time and you're done!
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Telegram, Python and MySQL (Linux Subsystem)

                <p>
                    First time making a telegram app and hosting a web app is tougher than we thought. The idea and logic was not the difficult part, but the execution was tedious and full of syntax and mysterious network errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Managed to get this app working in a day even though nobody in the team had any experience with coding web apps or Telegram. The whole thing was difficult as we did not start learning until the competition itself.

                    What I learned

                    Telegram Bot API, loads of Python, hosting a network server
