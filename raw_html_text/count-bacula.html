                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    University students tend to push the limits of their alcohol tolerance without really understanding the consequences. Most BAC calculators come off very preachy and are targeted at preventing people from drinking. We wanted to make a BAC calculator app that encourages students to drink responsibly but doesn't exaggerate the consequences of their drinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates the estimated BAC of the user after x many shots and hours and tells them how intoxicated they will be at that level. This allows them to be more aware of where their alcohol limit is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built by creating a web server using Flask and then routing different requests to different URLs. The submit button calls a POST method in the python script which calculates the BAC and is then routed to a results page. The design was put together using elements of bootstrap and jQuery.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some reason, the calculator wasn't working properly. After a couple hours of debugging, we ended up just rewriting the entire back-end for it to work.

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a server on Flask. None of us have ever done this before.
Making it mobile-friendly. This app is intended for on-the-go use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a server on Flask and how to use bootstrap templates. Our front-end guy had never used Python, so creating the entire web app in Python was a huge learning experience.
                </p>
