                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research papers as well as textbooks costing a great deal too much
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use blockchain technologies treating the ledger as a compilation of true statements
e.g. 'The sum of all the natural numbers is -1/12'
And the transactions are proposals
e.g. 'Yev' proposes 'a=b implies b=a'
The proof-of-concept is the proving, which, for the sake of this mock-up, is manual
But, in the future, the poc would be a machine learning algorithm which logically evaluates the proof
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of time and caffeine
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing a simple mock-up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To bring caffeine and that quickly getting the writing the server is essential in time constraints
