                <p>
                    The simplest way to encourage a greener society is to learn how to process waste efficiently. To that end, we've developed Trash Wizard to help you classify and understand how to place your trash items so that it's better for both our waste management services, and the planet!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask using voice, type, or take a photo or a barcode of a product and our system will do its best to tell you how to dispose of that item.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Getting all the data to work properly and classify different types of images. Also ran into a lot of issues with APIs for barcode reading and image recognition.
