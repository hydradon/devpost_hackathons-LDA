                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the unpredictability of the British weather, I wanted to create a skill that helps me know when to hang the washing out on the washing line. The criteria obviously being  to tell the user  the dry days that will have no rain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill uses the OpenWeatherMap API, combined with your location, to determine the best day to do your laundry and hang out you washing on the washing line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will look at the amount of rainfall during daylight hours, and suggest the days which are dry only. Thus avoid getting caught out by one of them days where it looks like a sunny day, but you have a sudden downpour!
                </p>
