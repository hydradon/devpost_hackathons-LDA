                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we looked at certain issues that we have faced in our daily studies. One of the biggest challenges is finding efficient ways to learn lecture notes. We either spend a lot of time writing flashcards and use them for a few days, or we just keep reading our notes without actually memorizing them. We wanted to solve that issue by making reviewing lecture notes simpler.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user imports a .txt file which is analyzed by Google Cloud Natural Language API. Then, the text file will go through 3 different processes. The first one is a summary made of the most relevant sentences. Next, StudyBuddy creates "smart" questions based on the summary and the syntax of the sentences. Finally, the entire text will be transformed into a fill-in-the-blanks kind of exercise.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Eclipse IDE with Java. We also used libraries from Google Cloud (Natural Language).

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into quite a lot of challenges. The biggest one was a way to make our product come to life in just a few hours. We thus had to scale down our vision given our abilities and skills. When we started to get some results, we also had to keep the flow going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting tangible results that are quite useful and close to what we wanted. We are proud of using a Google API because we wanted to do that since the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to coordinate the different sections of our code. We also learned a lot about the Google Cloud API, salience analysis and the English language to make relevant questions.

                    What's next for StudyBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add at first a Google Home interface where what was created with StudyBuddy would be accessible as a Google Home Action. Eventually, we would love to see our software deployed on mobiles.
