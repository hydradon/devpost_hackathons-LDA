                    Going fully live on Andriod and iOS.
Using Google or Amazon platforms to run cloud based systems. 
Refining the frontend more to make our data analytics even more easily consumed by busy and stressed first responders. 
Improve collection algorithm. 
Possible API for third-party integration(i.e. active 911)
