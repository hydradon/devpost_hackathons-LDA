                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group therapy kept me from killing myself. I know too many people who are too afraid to seek help because there aren't tools available for them.
                </p>

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An anonymous, safe, secure, password-protected massive coming together of people with similar mental disorders. They can meet in scheduled, formatted groups created by people for people. There will also be an online chat to provide real connections beyond the therapy session. A special "cross" button in the top right corner lists international hotlines for all mental disorders, and then lists recommended in-or-out of service providers based on given profile information like learning style, insurance, location, etc. A newsfeed provides encouraging and only positive posts such as "Something that made me learn about myself" or "Something that make me feel beautiful" or "Something that made me step out of my comfort zone" etc. Feed posts can also be set to different privacies. Other users can use stickers such as "We are here for you" or "Next step!" or "Proud of you" to provide uplifting encouragement.
