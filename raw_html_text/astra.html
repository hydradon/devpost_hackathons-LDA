                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Club meetings, company visits, parties, political events, video screenings, greek life, study sessions, sporting events, and so many more - there's a lot going on on college campuses every day. eEvents is a hyperlocal event broadcasting and discovery app made for college communities to find and keep track of events happening on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create accounts that link to their universities.
                    <br>
                    Once logged in, they can then see all the events around them, specific to their university, overlaid on a map. They can click into any event to view information like further details, venue, date and how many people are interested in the event. All the events that a user is interested in is also available at a glance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also create their own events, and only people in the university will be able to see said events. People can also indicate if they're interested in going, so other people can look at how many people are interested and accordingly judge whether they want to go to the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once on the event page, we used Button to provide more features such as being able to get an Uber to the location or getting tickets for the event if it was a concert.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend using the Django framework with PostgreSQL as our choice of database. We deployed it onto Heroku and used Amazon S3 to store our images. We also built our user system from the ground up and employed the use of sessions for a more managed structure and ease to scale and manage active sessions in the future. The app was built in Android Studio, written like a native Android app. Volley was our choice of networking library and we also made use of the Google Maps API. We also used Button in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into included configuring our maps and employing the Button API and understanding all it's callbacks and configurations. On the backend side of things, image upload and hosting it on AWS was an issue we faced and then getting AWS S3 to authenticate all these requests and allow multiple devices and to access multiple images while also maintaining security. However, we were able to solve these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Staying up for over 24 hours
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to accomplish so much in such a short span of time given that we spent all of the first night and the following morning trying to design our own Blockchain system from scratch. We since pivoted, were able to ideate, design and execute this idea. We also tried to work on things we hadn't worked on before, like the experienced Android guy worked on the backend and the web dev veteran worked on the Android app and so on.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New technologies. Perseverance. How to deal with cranky and sleepy programmers in the wee hours of the morning. But more than all, how to work together and have fun at the same time. I can now say that all of us are at around the same level of confidence across the tech stack while it started out in quite a polarized fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eEvents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot we can do. We can have universities post official events there. We can have push notifications to inform users when their events are starting. We can have invite-only events where the organizer can decide who to invite. We could try and learn from the events you're interested in to build a smart suggestion system. The sky is the limit. We have decided that we will continue working on this project beyond this hackathon and try and make it a large viable product and take it to scale.
