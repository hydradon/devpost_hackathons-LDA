                    I hate making decisions. For instance, deciding where to go out to eat, what to pick from a menu, what to name my firstborn child. So instead, I created this application to make decisions for me!

                    I created a similar project beforehand, lovingly called FileRNGesus, which did this but with opening games at random instead. However, no code was reused fro m FileRNGesus.

                    Input strings. Choose from one of these strings. Save this list for later. Load lists you have saved.

                    I originally wanted the project to pull data from Google Maps, ie, a user would input a term and it would pull the results of the search into the program, giving the user a list of nearby restaurants as per their search term.
However, that required some API stuff with google that I couldn't get to work, and I felt that it was too convoluted.
Furthermore, I am inexperienced leading teams with such projects, and I struggled to figure out how to effectively and efficiently repart tasks to my teammates so that we could work on this as a powerhouse unit. (I wish to credit them, however as of writing this they have both headed out, and I realize that I do not have their emails.)

                    Theoretically, I shouldn't have to ever decide on anything again. It's an upgrade to creating a mental array and then selecting from it through random numbers from Random.org.

                    MOBILE APP!! Literally who lugs a laptop around with them everywhere, and even if they do they aren't guaranteed internet access. The best way for this app to be pragmatically useful would be to transfer the general structure I have created to iPhone and Android.
