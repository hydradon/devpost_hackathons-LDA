                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we go to formal school as children, we learn a lot of what we learn orally: by speaking and listening, and doing so repeatedly.  This skill was inspired by that observation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to switch between two modes: drill and quiz.  In drill mode, the use listens to terms and their definitions, one after the other.  In quiz more, the user is quizzed, one term after the other and is told if they are right or wrong, and then the drilling continues.  The skill tries to get you into a focused zone where you can focus and learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected the content, crafted it to be usable in drill and quiz mode, and then built it incrementally: by first validating the core value and then by actually using it to learn ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The out of the box Alexa TTS is not perfect and so we had to do a lot of testing to catch mispronunciations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the skill actually does teach you and we are proud of the fact that we have built something that we ourselves will use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that conversational voice is a powerful educational tool if the design of the experience is pinned down.  Repetition and the clean nature of voice can combine to create an immersive experience that helps you learn better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Greek Mythology Drill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add terms and continue to chisel at the TTS.
