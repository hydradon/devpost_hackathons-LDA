                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the Red Sox signed David Price, my father, an obsessive fan, worked out how much he would be paid per pitch. Based off that, I wanted to make a quick comparison between pitchers based on their reported 2017 salary and overall regular season stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow users to compare cost per inning, cost per strikeout and cost per game between two MLB pitchers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a basic React.js app using the create-react-app library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting quality data on salary information in a usable, scaleable format was a big challenge. For the purposes of the hackathon I actually ended up stringing up mock data and focusing on the UX instead, with an eye on getting the data later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my second fully fleshed out React.js app that I started from scratch. I'm proud of how quickly I'm now thinking in the "React way" when building components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What I already knew - heading into a hackathon with a foggy idea of how to get the data I wanted is recipe for wheel spinning. But I was optimistic!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for David Pricey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to polish up the simple UX I have and focus on building a sustainable way of obtaining a dataset, either through an API or from multiple sources using a script (probably in Ruby). One big challenge will also be getting headshot images for all of the players.
