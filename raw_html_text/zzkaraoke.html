                    Think about an advanced version of The Mad Libs. But instead of filling words into a story, we fills words into an hit song, composed by Donald Trumps meme. The whole point is make the process as fun as possible.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we scratch UI and core functionality prototypes, an epoch as we refined our idea.
Then we separate to take charge of each part of the project.
Finally, we collaborate to deal with difficulties and aggregate each part into the final draft.
