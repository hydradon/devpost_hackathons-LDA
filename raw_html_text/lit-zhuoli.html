                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to democratize the process of choosing music for your party.

                <p>
                    Lit allows guests at a party to add songs to queue to be played. They can also upvote/downvote songs in the queue. The order of upcoming songs is determined by the votes on it, and how long it has been in the queue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend of Lisp is in Python, using Flask. All of the data is stored there. We used HTML/CSS/JS to create the frontend of the site, which communicates with the Flask application through socket.io. We used the YouTube API to provide music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't sure initially how to tackle individual user sessions, because Flask has a login feature included but we didn't want to require any sort of login. In the end, we used a uniquely generated user ID that's stored as a cookie on the user's machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the backend up and running really fast, even though none of us have experience with Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about using web frameworks and using sockets to communicate between front-end and back-end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to ramp up the backend and use a database to store all of the user data. On the front-end, we want to improve the UX and add some more powerful controls for party hosts to remove/skip songs.
