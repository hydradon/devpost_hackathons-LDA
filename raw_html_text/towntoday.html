                    I volunteered at Shriners Hospital for Children in their ICU, and fell in love with socially positive driven causes.

                    Unfortunately, many hospitals, Food banks, and even pet shelters don't have the marketing dollars to advertise their events &amp; causes. A lot of them don't have the data to learn about how to better service their community and key businesses running.
                </p>

                    TownToday aggregates events from local food banks, churches, pet shelters, and hospitals to make it easier for users to discover local causes to support.

                    Kelden did not give up, he continued to tackle the coding issue. We both stayed up the entire night and did not allow our sleepiness to get in the way of us succeeding.

                <h2>
                    Kelden learned how to edit UI. I learned that code needs to be looked over.
