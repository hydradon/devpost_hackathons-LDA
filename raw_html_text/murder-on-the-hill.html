                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had little to no web development experience and were curious about the process of creating a web app. We were given the seed of an idea at the Volhacks brainstorming session and added location functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple text game that responds to your geolocation when deciding what content to serve you. It uses two locations on UTK's campus (Ayres Hall and Min Kao) to change what a player wouold see when playing the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it mostly in Javascript and HTML5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of knowledge regarding web development. Lack of accuracy and consistency from HTML5 Geolocation API. Our site is still struggles to serve the correct content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end, learning JavaScript, learning Adobe Dreamweaver
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geolocation without the use of GPS can still be scarily accurate, despite the inconsistent and occasionally inaccurate results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Murder On The Hill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll use the things we've learned in other geolocation centered apps.
                </p>
