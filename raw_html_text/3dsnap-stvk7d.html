                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea was born due to the distance between me and my loved ones. Pictures are ok but when you are far from people you care you would like to have more than just 2D information. Saving memories in 3D as well could open the possibility to share with others you care your moments in a more immerse way. Additionally, one day visiting an exposition of old cars came to my mind that would be nice to 3D print such nice cars. Finally, when orders are made online I would like to have more visual information of the items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a HoloLens app and a tablet app. From the tablet inputs are given to the application. Taking advantage of the tracking capabilities and depth information from a depth camera, the application snaps geometry of the world and store it. The application is user guided. The point cloud from the camera can be visualized on the tablet and if snapped is uploaded to a server and send to be presented in HoloLens space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the intel real sense sdk to capture point cloud information. The HoloLens with the HoloToolkit to visualize it in the real world. And a node server to upload the mesh information from the depth camera and download it from HL. The camera is mounted on top of the HoloLens so the spaces can be aligned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I was planning on doing peer to peer communication of the mesh information but those small information were more than UDP and TCP/IP Sockets could handle to the best of my knowledge. I then followed the http web server by uploading / downloading the information. I had some problems with node and the integration with Unity one of the mentors helped me with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is something I have been wanting to do for some time and I felt this was the best moment to do it. I work with AR/VR and this helps better for my 3D understanding, additionally I can start making 3D snaps :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about NodeJS, and more about 3D understanding (transformations, spaces, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3Dsnap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not sure if I'll be able to add color, I can upload the frame but I am having a hard time on Unity applying the texture. Besides this, I would like to make it an app and give a social aspect to share things we value with our loved ones with an additional dimension. I think it would be useful as well for online retailers to provide more information of the items they sell.
