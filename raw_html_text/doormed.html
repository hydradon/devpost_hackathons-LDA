                <p>
                    People are becoming too busy in their daily activities that it's difficult to buy medicines on time for themselves and their beloved ones. An example would be my single aunt, who lives by herself and suffers through chronic migraine.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that can connect a common traveler with a patient in need of medicines and deliver them on time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is divided into two aspects: for patients and for travelers. We created a request based service system where patients post their requests to get their prescriptions delivered to their current location. Then the travelers have a choice to accept or deny request. Using the

                        Google Maps API
                    </strong>
                    we are able to display location of travelers and keep the patient updated about the delivery process.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple challenges such as creating a chat bot among the patient and traveler, connecting properly with the database, and finding directions between 2 locations using Google Maps API

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how we can solve problems in the society using teamwork, dedication and perseverance. We also learned how to interact with Firebase DB and google maps API.
