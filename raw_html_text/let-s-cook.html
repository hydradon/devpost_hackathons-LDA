                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So I became Alexa Developer a few months back. I'm a Third Year CSE student and always loved to explore and experiment with the technology around me. Voice is the next big thing in the industry with over Millions of AI enabled voice assistant devices already in the market. This is my first skill using APL and I hope it results out good. Didn't have much time to develop as my academic work was also there, but still I'm happy with my end results. Inspiration for this skill came to me from daily foodie desires. I always ask my mom to cook me something new everyday, but we can't decide what to make half of the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So I tried to make a skill which provides me a random recipe made using ingredient which I ask. I have also included a feature in which it will just give out a lucky &amp; trendy recipe name which we can try.
It uses an external API to fetch the names of the recipes and related information and then I relay it out to my users using Alexa.
You can ask it to give recipes made using cake etc.
I plan to include step by step instructions along with visuals in future updates of this skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took naive approach this time. While I was clear with my node.js &amp; lambda skills, I found Voiceflow extremely easy to use and achieve what i'm currently aiming for.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As usual the buggy API calls XD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully created my first Alexa Skill with APL. I know it had been out since October now, but i didn't get a chance to experiment with it until now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how APL document works, how to design custom layouts for different devices of different sizes etc. Also it was my first Multi Modal Alexa Skill, so feeling proud to bring visuals to the voice &lt;3
It's always fun building an Alexa Skill :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let's Cook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm planning to scale it up to support various regions. I live in India, so I'll try to bring regional dishes also to the skill. Also instead of an external API, I'm planning to build up my own AI model which can generate new recipes from available ingredients ( It would be a very nice experimental feature) 
Also Planning to provide step by step visual instructions to follow the recipe in the near future.
Thank you!
