                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the annoying mass spam emails that we [Texas A&amp;M students] get on a daily basis, and wanting to streamline relevant outreach emails to our main inbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This filters out those mass spam emails based upon your interests, so that you get what you want in your inbox, and the rest are redirected to a side folder that can be checked at leisure (or not at all :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After lots of research, we decided to use PyQt5 in Qt Creator to create a GUI that contains various check boxes. Python script was written and tested in PyCharm to generate a personalized XML filter file that can be easily imported to Gmail. Everything was later combined into Qt Creator to finalize the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everything was a challenge, but the hardest parts were figuring out the best way to parse Python to XML, and learning how to create a GUI that complemented the intended function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just in this demo, we are proud to say that you can now filter out approximately 75% of the mass spam emails that were previously all or nothing, opt-in or opt-out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning how to parse Python to XML, create a GUI, setup Python packages, and use Github, we learned how to delegate and attack a problem from multiple angles and how to come and work together to create a successful solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BTHOspam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan on adding more filter options and functionality to the base filters as well as implementing it on the web with auto-import to gmail.
