                    Being college student, we struggle to get out of bed every morning. We have to get out of bed. Climb down the bed. cross the enter room, converse with our roommate, and finally rotate the blinds open every morning. That's a whole 3 minutes and an unwanted conversation! Enter - Blindfold.

                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clap twice and voila!~ Open Blinds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We interfaced a sound sensor with an Arduino Microcontroller. We downloaded time libraries off Github to make sure that only two successive claps opened up the blinds and nothing else. We used a Mechanical relay, 12V Motor and wooden laser cut gears to do the magic!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially started off with a Raspberry Pi. However, we ran into problems because of our Sound sensor. We also tried to 3D print our gear system. However, the material would not adhere to the blinds firmly. Laser cutting to the rescue!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully figured out our mysterious sound sensor and probably order half of the entire hardware inventory. We tried to build an AC to DC converter to convert our sensor's analog input to digital. Our laser cut gears meshed perfectly!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sensors are weird. Never try to build an ADC from scratch at a hackathon.
