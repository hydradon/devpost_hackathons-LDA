                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    creates url based on user input, searches html file of page for puzzle data, uses recursive algorithm to solve puzzle
The board is represented as a 2d array of cells. Each cell contains one of the four types of pieces. Each piece keeps track of its four possible connections, which are all initially unknown (-1). The puzzle is solved when each piece knows the value of all of its connections. The recursive algorithm essentially makes a tree of guesses. Each guess is an assumption that the first unknown connection is True (1). This guess either leads to a correct solution, in which case the current board is updated to that solution, or an illegal position, in which case the current board is updated so that that connection is known to be False (0).
