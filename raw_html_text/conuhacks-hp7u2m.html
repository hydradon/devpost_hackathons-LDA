                    Moving to a new region or country can be tough for anyone, however, moving to a region where you don't speak the language can be even more challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FrancoChrome is designed to make this transition easier for anglophones in French majority regions. Everyday, as users open a new tab in the Chrome browser, they are presented with a new word in French along with it's English translation. In this manner, over the course of a year a user will be introduced to 10 000+ french words along with their pronunciation by a native French speaker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that as time progresses, the user continually builds their vocabulary passively and is able to better communicate with individuals in their neighborhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire project is hosted as a Chrome extension and will be available on Chrome Web Store.
