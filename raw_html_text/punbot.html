                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What do you call a bee that lives in America? USB. We like puns, you like puns, who doesn&rsquo;t like puns? PunBot shares the joys of puns with everyone. Thousands of people everyday &ldquo;dye&rdquo; because they don&rsquo;t hear good enough puns. We&rsquo;re &ldquo;hear&rdquo; to solve that. (Did you get the pun?)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PunBot creates puns based on input from the user in real time. These puns are punnable_as_hell and will lift up the user&rsquo;s interface (^:

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python with the Pycharm IDE to create the scripts that make up our PunBot. We utilized the Google Cloud Speech API in the project as well. Various libraries and online file converters were also used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first glaring problem we reached when we started was that ⅘ of our team did not have Python installed and had the smallest of clues on how to use Python and/or IDEs. We hadn&rsquo;t formed a recipe until the night before the submission. Adjusting to the responsibility of managing time for difficult projects with zero structure also proved to be a challenge. Not gonna LIE but using the hard ground as a bed was not fun.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all of our members possessing very little (or no) experience with the Python language, we learned how to create a program that could write out simple puns based on inputs from random sentences as well as learn the basics of implementing an API.

                    What's next for PunBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Real time transcription of the audio from a video to text that will overlay over the video itself.
-Rather than coding in a few example pun-styles, we would like PunBot to better analyze the English language, recognizing more than the pre-set vocabulary and being able to create puns based on the context of what is said
-Better hardware to make voice recognition accurate
