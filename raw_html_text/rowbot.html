                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The source of inspiration for building Rowbot stems from a strong dislike of driving tractors through orchards as a part-time job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is a Rowbot?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rowbot is an autonomous rover that will navigate through orchards, spraying weeds in a controlled fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How is it built?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The spraying module is composed of an Arduino, two MG996R servo motors, and an LED. The module is programmed using C++ and Python. 
The Python side of the program uses OpenCV  to detect weeds in a video, then sharing the weed's coordinates to the Arduino where they are translated to motor movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was interfacing a Python script with the Arduino over a serial communication. This brought hours of troubleshooting along with extensive research of serial communication between the different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rowbot is still in a very early developmental stage. Next steps include building a rover, automating the rover using cameras and various sensors, and adapting our existing modules to the rover.
