                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was dealing with Mental Health issues myself and did not have enough resources to which I can open up to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses AI to help with your Mental Health issues. The AI will have deeper conversations with you and find out if you are dealing with any mental health issues.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Platform/DialogFlow for the Google Home App and HTML/CSS as well as Javascript for the web app.
