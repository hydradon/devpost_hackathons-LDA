                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We thought it'd be cool if this thing was a thing

                    It converts an audio recording into a sheet music

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recorded the audio to obtain the amplitudes. Then, we apply Fourier Transform to obtain the frequencies. Then converted the peak frequencies to notes. Then finally, we used LilyPond to annotate a PDF with the score.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Low frequency noise is more prominent than the voice in the recording.
