                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Standing in the food queue at BrumHack and remembering how all food at hackathons is just a mad dash for food, it seemed like there was a more civilised way to do it. What if instead you could send text messages to your hackers letting them know that their food was ready.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a CLI tool that provides a series of commands for generating YAML about your hackathon and your attendees, send them information about meals and group them for sending personalised messages
                </p>
                <h2>

                    It's my first headless hack
                </p>

                    What's next for HackaServe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons aren't about trying to create the next startup, whatever is next is next and this what I hate about stupid devpost, it's moronic desire to generate a startup out of every idea. This idea is just a cool simple tool, isn't that enough for you parasites??
