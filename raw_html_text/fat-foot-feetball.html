                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was an old flash game that a bunch of us used to play back in the day. We decided to make it our own and everyone has their own little piece in the game.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This 2D soccer game allows you and one friend to go head-to-head in a best of 7 soccer match. The left player uses "WASD" and "Space" while the right player uses "Arrows" and "M".

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was built on Unity. We used a 2D game template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all of us have never used Unity or developed a game so it was a challenge to learn the technology but we are very proud with what we learned in 24 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to divide the work up and make sure everyone had a large part in the project. As we had people from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Industrial Design, Foster Care Case Worker, and an 8th grade student it was a challenge and learning experience for everyone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first time any of us have ever made a 2D Unity game from scratch. We all learned so much about Unity itself as well as game development.
