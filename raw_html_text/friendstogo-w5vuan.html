                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us are very indecisive about making plans and usually anything we decide fails horribly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    picks the midpoint between two independent parties and finds locations to meetup at based on your selected preference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    used express.js and caffeine pills.
.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    used the mlh starter template and ran into issues with sequalize. Also ran into issues with google maps api so we did something else completely. Had version 3.0 in the last 6 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we got it work! UI was a little delayed but the functionality is there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a lot about how google api works as well as routing with express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FriendsToGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    possibly host it and add a nicer, maybe an actual map to display the meetup points.
