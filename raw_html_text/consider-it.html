                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bullying has always been a societal issue.  With the rise of technology, the stage for bullying has shifted and cyber-bullying has become prevalent in people of both genders and all ages.  The comfort of anonymity as well as the instantaneous nature of social media has further facilitated this.
                    <br>
                    We chose to focus on college-aged students as our key demographic.  Campus is a connected, yet broad network in which both anonymous and instantaneous bullying occurs across a variety of platforms (Yik Yak, Snapchat, Twitter, etc.)  We wanted to take a preventative and proactive approach to cyber-bullying by exploring the universal nature of bullying.  Anyone can be bullied.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive "Choose Your Own Adventure" format of the average student's day.  It explores different, fairly innocent yet common scenarios on college campuses that can and do lead to bullying.  The hack appeals to the user's empathy by showing them that anyone can be bullied.  It encourages the user to think before taking certain actions.  It also links to resources for those who are and have been bullied to show them that they have options.  We wanted to keep it simple so it didn't over-load the user demographic with information or force them to feel guilty.  Empathy is a key factor in our project.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a large number of custom graphics on Adobe Illustrator.  A few were obtained from the internet and edited.  Using internet resources and the workshops from yesterday, we explored different options (JavaFX, various IDEs, Python, etc.) and settled on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a web app for it.  We then created a repository and divided the work based on each member's skill-set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues with basic things.  Once we hashed out our idea, we spent a lot of time figuring out what the best approach to render it was.  After that, it was the smaller things like alignment, aesthetic, getting the code to do what we wanted it to.  We learned a lot in the process about the more minute details of coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel as if we accomplished the premise of our app and that is a success for us!  It is particularly important because it addresses a very important societal issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about what we still need to learn.  Having an idea on paper and in your head is great, but that has to be substantiated technically.  We worked to the best of our abilities but through our exploration we learned a lot about all that is out there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We think that this concept has a lot of potential.  A few ideas we had were:
                    <strong>
                        1) A certification component
                    </strong>
                    :  Schools could include this as part of an online orientation for students at the beginning of each year.  It is brief but reiterates the seriousness of cyberbullying.
                    <strong>
                        2) Social Media
                    </strong>
                    :  If someone is reported online for bullying, his or her social media account is frozen until they complete this.
                    <strong>
                        3) **
                        <em>
                            Data Collection/Analysis:  Prior to doing the walk through, the user fills out basic information about himself or herself.  The choices he or she makes during the scenario are saved.  This can be used to make correlations to better understand the problem."
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        4) Extra Facts/ Pop Up Quiz
                    </strong>
                    :  There are a few facts on each stage of the interactive site that allow the user to better understand the prevalence and seriousness of the issue.
