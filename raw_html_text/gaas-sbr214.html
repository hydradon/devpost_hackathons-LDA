                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the challenge at LauzHack this year that we both loved and thought it&rsquo;d be fun to try out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the server, it downloads, extracts and processes hospital data and outputs an statistical exerpt that is very light and easy to send to clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always loved java, so we&rsquo;ve chosen to use it for everything : a web server is making sure clients can get hospital room infos, another thread is used to get new datas from the server automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The datasets were huge. Even vim had trouble opening them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Processing those datasets was not the easiest of tasks. After 10 hours of failure we were so proud to see our files being decoded !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biomedical is hard. Very hard.
                </p>

                    What's next for GaaS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No idea. Perhaps even more scallable systems ?
