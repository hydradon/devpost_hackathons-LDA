                    Did you know that orange juice has 7 times the carbon footprint of a banana? Or that the environmental impact of a bag of crisps you're enjoying is equivalent to almost 15 apples?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, we have food from all around the world at our fingertips. But do we ever pause to think how far this food has travelled? How much of a carbon footprint does this cause?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        EcoScan
                    </strong>
                    seeks to raise awareness of this issue, to encourage people to take action. Scan your food in a supermarket, for example, and EcoScan displays its carbon footprint. Consumers can then reconsider their food choices.

                    Development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend uses Microsoft Azure hosting a Python Flask webapp, which connects to the Azure Custom Vision API. We trained it on 75 images of various foods. Frontend involves React JS and Gatsby.
