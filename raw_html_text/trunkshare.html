                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the lack of use of car trunks in our everyday life
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes route information from those who requests and matches user who uses that route to go to work, school, etc. After confirmation is received on both ends, the matched user will take the baggage and send it to the location that should be on the driver's way.
This would give restaurants and stores an alternative to deliver and receive products. This would also give drivers pocket changes just by adding a couple of minutes to their commute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html with minikura API for the information gathering and website making. It would also be used to match users to drivers. An Iot device is also attached to the baggage to read information of the way the driver was driving and to inform the user of status of delivery. This information will also be used to give the drivers rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to implement the Iot device to the server made in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the UI that would give users an easy way to access their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned of the challenges that comes from regulating ways to give an efficient service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrunkShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to spread this service, so that it would not only be car trunks that would be used, but also car rooftops to provide delivery.
