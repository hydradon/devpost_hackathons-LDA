                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple game while learning how to use Unity and script in C#. We came up with the idea of creating a game that only involved touch inputs from the user as we felt that this would be a good introduction to building games using Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keyhole is a game in which the objective is to fit a moving piece into its complement at the bottom by clicking at the correct time. Keyhole is a simple game that can be played on any computer by people of all ages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to create all aspects of the game, including the GUI, animations, and scripting for the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were negligent about seeding a random function, so we continued to get the same values over and over from our function. This was a major roadblock for us as it took quite a while to find the bug and resolve it. Further, we did not test our code as we were writing it, so we would finish writing a script and then have many bugs that we needed to fix. We learned a lot about the importance of debugging and testing throughout the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to think of an original game and write the script for the majority of the game in just 24 hours as all members of the team are extremely new to Hackathons and mostly new to Unity and C#. We are proud that this is a full game that we will be able to complete and post in the App Store and Google Play Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, we learned a lot about the importance of testing our code incrementally. We also learned a lot about how to use Unity and script in C#, and we also learned how to implement a somewhat complex mathematical function that computes a normal data set based on a given mean and standard deviation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Keyhole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to polish the game and fix up the GUI before submitting our app to the App Store and Google Play Store.
                </p>
