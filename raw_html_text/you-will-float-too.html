                    Inspiration Smoke and Google Map pins are great at orienting people as well as marking important locations. We will use Balloons as a kind of smoke to guide and signal but more persistent. If you look at Google Maps with Pins, you will note that the pins already look like Balloons, we are in a way creating real life massive pins in the real world that can orient and mark locations for fleeing masses.

                    What it does The Lighter Than Air  Tactical Operational Platform can serve as a last resort bullet proof way to re-establish minimal command, control and communication with evacuees, military and first responders.

                    How we built it The platform is designed a lot like traffic lights and billboards communicating Go-No Go nav areas and latest conditions. We simply need materials and on the ground personnel to launch, maintain and update the balloons.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of. We have created  depth layered responses for carious type of balloon signal solutions from Nav Points, Collections Areas to marking danger and medical assisting. We also have more advanced operations for Bill Board Aerostats towed by Drones as well as giving mylar balloons so that overhead surviellence can track and mark elderly or injured perssons.

                    What we learned Sometimes the best solution is not the most complex nor highly technological. Resilience is built upon simple rules and interfaces.
