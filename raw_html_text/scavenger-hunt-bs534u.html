                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scavenger Hunt came out of a failed attempt to build an indoor navigation app. We took what we coded with the navigation system and used it in a simpler application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows you a &ldquo;map&rdquo; of hidden scavenger items inside a building. As the user moves, they can see where they are relative to the scavenger items. This is a fun app that is great for events such as a Hackathon where participants want to have some fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android&rsquo;s Location Services and phone sensors to determine the user&rsquo;s location. Additionally we used android&rsquo;s canvas to draw our ui and handle user gestures make it easier for the user to navigate around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We had originally planned to use the Augmented reality core for Android but we found that it was not compatible with any of our devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also found that the accuracy of the locations we could retrieve were not precise enough for what we had originally wanted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When we decided to change ideas and do a scavenger hunt instead, there wasn&rsquo;t as much time. So we found that it was important to reuse as much of the existing code that we had
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Used Android Location Services API to locate user in a building with accuracy within 10 meters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used phone&rsquo;s magnetometer to determine orientation relative to North Pole
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphed scavenger items on canvas and dynamically showed user&rsquo;s location
                    </li>
                </ul>
