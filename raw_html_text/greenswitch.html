                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to combine our experiences as EE majors &amp; CS majors to create a life hack.

                <p>
                    From our website (

                    ), you can turn a light on and off remotely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino board to control a Servo motor by reading instructions from our website which was updated with PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we tried to use an Ethernet shield but ran into issues with SEASNet &amp; having to register our device. Luckily, we found a wifi shield en lieu!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the Arduino software was harder than it sounds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working as a team and sharing the work, as well as, helping each other out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreenSwitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd love to create an app that could contact the Arduino. We would also like to implement more features, such as, displaying the amount of time the light is on and off - perhaps showing the cost of keeping the light on and how much energy it uses.
