                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yaoyao and I are in an architecture / CS class that recently introduced a unit on color theory and colorblindness in lecture the other day. We got to thinking about how many modern UX design environments don't emphasize the importance of inclusive design, especially to the visually impaired community. To keep track of these many important, yet often overlooked tenants of accessible design, we decided to build a webapp that serves as both an educational tool but also as a practical design assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forsight is a code review and disability awareness service that grounds an inclusive design education within an interactive environment. We work with the user's provided CSS code, run it through a string-searching, data-extracting system, and compare extracted information values to research-based guidelines on inclusive design. We then provide recommendations on how to approve the accessibility of the given design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML/CSS, javascript, PHP, Python, Flask, SQL, Figma
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we did want our platform to be as interactive as possible, we ran into many roadblocks from translating a somewhat lofty prototype into a fully functional webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website not only features a product promoting inclusive design, but also features a web design itself was built with extreme detail to fitting such inclusivity principles itself. Our color scheme, font choice, and many other CSS attributes factor into the site's accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we're proud of coding the webapp up to the extent that we did, despite some final smoothing out still needing to be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much, much, more about what it means to build a well-designed, accessible product.
We learned more about building APIs and the vast range of color related APIs out there, which we are eager to include.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Forsight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding functionality to error catching / code review.
Expanding code review capabiities to HTML framework.
Increasing the audiences that the webapp promotes inclusivity towards (the hearing impaired community, the community experiencing joint pain/arthritis).
