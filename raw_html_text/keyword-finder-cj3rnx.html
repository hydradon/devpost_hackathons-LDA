                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this program after seeing many college students having difficulty reading through dense texts because of potentially difficult/important words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program take a text document or pdf and sorts all of the different words into a binary search tree. It then displays the words in order of most reoccurring in a table. The purpose of this is to highlight key words in a document that the user might need to pay attention to as it is most likely an important topic in that section of text. However, a large amount of very common, insignificant words such as "and, was, too, etc." have not been included as those are not very helpful in distinguishing important concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to build the GUI to enter the file. We then used the Dropbox API to upload our results to the cloud, where it is then formed as a static website by pancake.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulty with formatting the tables on the results page. We also had to spend some time with allowing the program to input pdfs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our program can take the data parsed through the file and produce a pie chart of the relative frequency of starting letters. We are also proud that our program works with pdfs, as originally, it only accepted txt file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to practically use a binary search tree to sort through large amounts of text. We also learned how to use basic features of the Dropbox API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Keyword Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement this algorithm to potentially make a program that can summarize the input text by locating key words.
