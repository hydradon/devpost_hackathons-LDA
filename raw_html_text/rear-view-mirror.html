                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During a presentation at another hackathon, issues were faced when trying to coordinate between multiple projected screens. Awkward neck-aching turns were required to coordinate the whole presentation. What if there could be a "rear view mirror" to see what's going on on the external displays, hence making such coordination less awkward and more neck-relieving?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rear View Mirror (RVM) provides a picture-in-picture overview of the multiple display outputs on your main screen. This allow for easy coordination between extended screens during presentations without having to look at the projected screens anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used electron.js as we are already familiar with JavaScript and it provided the relevant APIs needed to accomplish our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out why streaming is not working and turns out it's due to macOS's security safeguards for screen-recording. Furthermore, dynamic sizing of the picture-in-picture overview proved to be tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works satisfactorily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Super Snacks opens till 2am. The food is good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rear View Mirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A re-write in swift to access the native macOS' screen streaming APIs directly. Electron.js is a resource hog and is not suitable for such a program, but is sufficient for a proof-of-concept during the hackathon due to the time crunch.
