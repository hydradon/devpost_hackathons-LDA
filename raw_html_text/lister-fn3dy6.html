                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each share many diverse interests. For example, one team member really liked to listen to music, and another enjoyed reading. As such, we hoped that there was one service that could find content for any category of media. We came to the realization that people with similar interests can often lead to discover of new (preferred) content based on the user.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app allows users to create categories, at the highest level. This includes movies, books, music, etc. Then, users can each create their own unique subcategories based on the categories (for example, a use can create "adventure" under "books"). These subcategories are exclusive to a user, and serve to store entries (eg: individual book titles). The app then matches these subcategories of uses, and ranks others' lists based on number of matches. Then, the user can view and research the different entries.
