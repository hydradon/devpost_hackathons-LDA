                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After riding on the bus twice a day, five days a week, always having to stay alert for when to let the bus driver know I need to get off, I knew there was a problem that could be solved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No Bus Fuss allows a bus rider to immediately let the driver know what stop they're getting off at via a mobile web application. This means they can sit back, relax, and know there's no chance that they'll miss their stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No Bus Fuss has so many different components, it was hard to know where to begin. And as soon as we began, we didn't know if it was where we should have started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have made real our dream of a location based bus app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned JQuery and how to use MapBox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for No Bus Fuss
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No Bus Fuss will soon be adding push notifications so if you fall asleep or are engaged in a book, it will wake you up as you approach your stop.
