                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While volunteering at Women's Shelter, one of our members had the realization that a lot of women have to go through a tedious process of trying to find emergency shelter during times of crisis. We decided to make the process a little easier for anyone in need of an emergency shelter and other resources.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides up-to-date data about the availability of beds (and rooms) in shelters in your community. In addition to availability, you are also able to see if the shelter is unisex, and if they will accommodate children. Shelters will have access the website and add the most recent room or bed counts to the app, ensuring that people do not have to call in to verify availability.
