                    Periods aren't pleasant, but adding the complication of homelessness brings another level of inconvenience to the misery. For homeless women, having periods without proper access to sanitary napkins, they're often forced to go without it; even in harsh cold conditions that could lead to infections, depression and general degradation of their health.

                    By clicking on 'Find Shelters' button below, you can see the homeless shelters near your current location.
This initiative started with the concept of solving homeless period problem but it not limited to that. It is simply a portal to get information about the capabilities of the shelter and its crowd. It is upto you how you can increase its capability. :)

                    I used basic javascript and google maps api to locate homeless shelters near the user's current location.

                    This initiative started with the concept of solving homeless period problem but it not limited to that. It is simply a portal to get information about the shelters near you, its capabilities and crowd. Let's say you have a small business of making pillow covers, and there are people in these home shelters that also have those skills that are required to enhance your business, you could look at the statistics of those shelters, look at the skills people have, give employment to those who you can. Thereby starting to eliminate such problems one step at a time.
                    <br>
                    It is upto you what you can offer. Some classes at the shelter, therapy sessions, etc.
