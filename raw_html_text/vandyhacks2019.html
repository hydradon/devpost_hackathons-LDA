                    This is an application to help scriptwriters to write script involving multiple roles and hear playback of the script written.

                <p>
                    User logs in and enters the number of roles in the play. Then user is prompted to enter the details of each character in the play such as name, gender etc. User then enters the dialogues and the speaker of that dialogue in the entire script. Once the script is submitted, the user can view the script or request a playback of the script. When the user selects to view the script, the script is displayed with an option to edit the dialogues. When user requests to hear the playback of the script, the user is sent or streamed an audio file that contains all the dialogues played in order in their respective voices.
