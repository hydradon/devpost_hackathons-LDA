                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As avid Monopoly enthusiasts &amp; proud Stony Brook students, our aim was to combine the two and create something truly - far beyond!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play online monopoly (up to 4 players) on our server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent long tedious hours working on developing the front end (the board) to look pretty using react.js and scss. We then made sure to create an Information board, and have logic being served through Node.js on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling doing turns for players and creating the front end for the board were extremely challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy with our layout and also our amazing choices of locations ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end is hard, and tedious but as long as you're having fun, time flies by.
                </p>
