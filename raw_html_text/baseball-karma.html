                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are certain athletes that are really good and find themselves on some of our favorite teams, but have done terrible things in the past and have shown little remorse. We're trying to find a way to let you continue to root for your team even if someone like this is on the roster.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baseball Karma allows you to select a player, and for every positive stat they collect (home run, RBI, wins, saves, etc.) you can pledge to donate some amount of money to a charity. That way, you can feel better about rooting for these awful human beings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sinatra/Ruby backend, Javascript/JQuery/CSS frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We formed a team that had different expertise, which was good, but we had very little overlap so a lot of time was spent getting ourselves ramped up on different technologies.
But the biggest mistake we made was integrating too late: we have a lot of functionality on the backend that the frontend isn't even aware of, and we ran into lots of integration problems when we finally got around to doing that.

                <p>
                    It's looking good, and we think it's a good idea
