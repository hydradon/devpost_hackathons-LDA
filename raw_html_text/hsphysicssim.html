                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After using Unity3D for a few years, we were inspired to create our own 2D physics engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program uses our low-level rendering Java API to draw simple 2D shapes to the screen and give them physics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java in conjunction with Git and Intellij Idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of the project was discerning the algorithm to draw a line that was converted from cartesian space to pixel space. The conversion formula took us a while to figure out correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drawing lines and shapes using our very own rendering API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new algorithms in this project, including how to draw a line efficiently and consistently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Make it into a fully-fledged physics API with complete features and extras.
