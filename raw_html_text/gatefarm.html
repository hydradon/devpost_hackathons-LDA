                    This project was created by Chase Parker and Eric Nwokocha for the 2018 UTD Hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How To:
    To execute the application open the "MainPage.html" with a browser of your choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal:
    Our goal with the project was to create an application which could help teach children
    about and make children interested in computer science and engineering. We decided that
    the foundation of computer science is boolean algebra, so we chose to try and make a
    game which would teach kids the basic principles of boolean algebra.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The plan was to develop a simple game about flipping switches to trigger a light bulb to
turn on. The switches which would need to be flipped would be determined by a visible
circuit. The levels would start simple and progressively increase in difficulty until
random flipping of switches would not be adequate to proceed in the game. The player
will have to try and understand the logic to figure out which switches to flip.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Difficulties:
    Originally our goal was to create the game as an android mobile application. This was
    ultimately impossible because neither of our laptops supported the type of virtualization
    required by Android Studio to run the virtual machine software on which we would test our
    code. This made developing an android application practically very difficult and unrealistic.
    We would have no easy way to test the code.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>When it became clear that android development was not an option, we decided to switch to web
development, that way any game we make could still be executed on a smart mobile device. Neither
my partner nor I had previous experience doing web development. We spent a good portion of our
time reading documentation and learning how to use JavaScript with CSS and HTML. This made any
development particularly difficult, especially given the tight time constraints.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Things we would have done if not for the 24 hour restriction:
    -added labels for each switch.
    -made the application look more professional.
    -added more levels, and improved the level content.
    Adding sound and more visual elements would make the game more eye-catching to elementary and middle schoolers.
    Implementing a score system, where you are deducted points for accuracy/randomly flipping the switches,
    would make the game more competitive, and encourage the students to compete with their friends on their overall score, 
    individual level score, accuracy%, and how far they can go/how many levels they can complete.
