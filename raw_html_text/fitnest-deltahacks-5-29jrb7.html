                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the internet age connects tech-savvy generation z's, those of elderly age often miss out on the benefits that instant connection provides. Regardless of age, fitness and physical activity are crucial for humans. Therefore, Fitnest feels that there is a unquestionable need to offer senior citizens the benefits of modern technology to encourage the achievement of health goals.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitnest acts as a social media and event monitoring application. It allows users to create a profile with their information and goals, as well as find similar people in the community they would be interested in exercising with based on their profiles. They can also message them, easily sign up for events, and be aware of new ones to enjoy.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was created using MIT's app inventor. This allowed the Fitnest team to design a customized, yet approachable interface.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As with all projects, many challenges were faced during the creation of this app. There were troubles with designing a robust messaging interface, as well as creating in depth features that would make the experience more tailored to the user.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the proof of concept app that we have created. Many of our team members have little experience with app development, so the creation of the final product has been a rewarding journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to be creative with finding resources for developing apps, what features matter to our users, as well as elements of app development from a front end perspective.

                    What's next for FITNEST - DELTAHACKS 5
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future iterations, we'd love to improve the app we have designed. We would like to create features that show a calendar like view of events, as well as simple goal tracking/step counting. We would also like to simplify any feature that may seem complicated, as well as introduce additional written steps for each element of the app. This improvement would allow non-technical versed users to feel comfortable with the application.
