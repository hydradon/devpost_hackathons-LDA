                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our way to the hackathon from Charlotte, we saw a fog in the air and wondered if its safe to breathe it and how polluted it was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it send a Text notifications warning people about polluted air.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used a raspberry pi 3 to run a Node.js server. we used an API to check the air quality in cities every 30 minutes and send a text warning if the air is poisoned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    knowing how to use Node.js. never worked with APIs before and discovering what Jason is, and working on a raspberry pi for the first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    getting the raspberry pi to send text messages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jason is a JavaScript Object :)
when you're using a new tool, never spend too many hours trying to debug it because there are always many other tools that you can use. there are so many useful APIs that do different things

                <p>
                    having it check for pollen and weather hazards not just air quality
