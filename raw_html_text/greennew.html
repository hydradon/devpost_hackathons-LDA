                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a website with an environmental platform using our diverse cultural background to share and source ways to repurpose and recycle everyday objects as was done in our native homelands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website informs people how to repurpose and reuse everyday objects using our experiences in our homelands as inspiration, such as utilizing old t-shirts as replacements for towels rather than throwing them out. It also allows you to post donation drive events in support of natural disaster victims or friendly clothing/items swaps. It can also be use to post events related to climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Heroku, and APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all experiencing our first hackathon and had less than two months of coding experience. We had to learn various languages including CSS to create the project. We also experienced difficulty pushing our final files to Heroku.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished a full stack application in less than 48 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the growth of our coding skills (such as learning CSS), we were able to learn how cultures other than our own repurposed and reused items thanks to our diverse background. It also served as a stark reminder that we do not have to play into the throwaway culture present in the US as we all already possess the skills and knowledge to recycle and repurpose due to the necessity we face in our home countries.
                </p>

                    What's next for greenNew
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to make the website more dynamic by implementing API's that will allow for donation centers to be stated according to the location as well as having users submit ways of repurposing or reusing items that they have learned or experienced. We hope to use reactnative to take GreenNew mobile.
