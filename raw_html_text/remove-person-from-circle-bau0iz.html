                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I created a program to simulates the problem and find solutions using brute force and I was able to find a solution by observing the results
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am pretty sure there is a math formula to find the result directly but I think the benefits of the could by keeping the solution clear and easier to understand make it good enough :P

                    I am proud to solve a problem by thinking out of the box and having an open mind approach to find a solution
