                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have initially created Spelling Teacher to help our own children doing their spelling homework on their own while we were cooking and working.
The kids enjoyed using new technology and their parents appreciated the help !
We hope you will find your own way of using Spelling Teacher.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spelling Teacher spells words to prepare for spelling tests. Alexa will read a list of words, allow time for the student to write each word down. The user can ask Alexa to repeat the last word, or spell it to verify the student's knowledge.
The application also provides help with sorting the list of words in Alphabetical order
Last but not least, the application supports adding new lessons with a simple configuration step. You will receive an email with a link to a page where a new lesson can be created.
