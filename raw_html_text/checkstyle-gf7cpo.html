                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    For a project, we wanted to make the people's lives better. In particular, we wanted to make a college student's life better. As college students ourselves, we know the troubles and hardships of college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we asked around and asked ourselves what is the biggest problem with college life, we got one big answer: Time Management. We decided to make a specialized planner app that will fix the traditional problems involving time management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are a lot of productivity apps and web apps out there (eg planner apps), there aren&rsquo;t any that offer all of the specific functions that we thought were important and should be included in an effective time management app. 
Another problem involves how many planner apps allow students to visualize events on their schedule, but still require a lot of mental planning for students to plan out what they need to do leading up to their events such as organizing when to study for a test or when to do a project. This app will hope to streamline and simplify that process and as a result, help students learn how to organize their time better.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What It Does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The main function we intended to include in our planner application involved allowing users to enter own events into their calendar, and to suggest time slots in which such tasks had to be completed. This would streamline the process of having users spend time trying to also plan for when such events should be accomplished. A to do list would also be created when clicking on a day of the calendar. The tasks on the to do list would be sorted based on when the soonest events due possible.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How We Built It
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Using the FullCalendar API, we were able to implement a calendar display into our website involving many features. We also used jQuery and javaScript, HTML, as well as CSS.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge for this hackathon was lack of knowledge. Most of our group had most knowledge with Java and knew how to understand front-end with HTML and CSS, but our lack of knowledge with the back-end prevented us from fully accomplishing what we intended our app to do. Furthermore, we did not know most of the git commands, therefore, we spent a great deal of time learning the git commands so we can work with the code at the same time.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments We Are Proud Of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use APIs, getting into back-end web development, and challenging ourselves to work throughout the 36 hour time period we were given.
