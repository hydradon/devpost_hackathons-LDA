                    An app to help you plan an exciting road trip!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us had roles which we specialized on, yet we all worked extensively on most parts of the product.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time. Time. Time. Its always a struggle to complete the tasks which you have prioritized above the others. In the end, we are extremely satisfied with what we were able to accomplish in such a short period of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am personally glad to have grown intimately acquainted with the Web2py framework, and the super cool Ractive Javascript template for data-binding which we used along with ajax calls to make our website load and react to user movements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we had a strong focus on design, planning, and database management (aided by the MVC architecture built into the Web2py framework). Drawing upon our own experiences as users of technology and web-based applications we were able to narrow down which features were absolutely necessary to include within our shortened time span for development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we all developed a much greater understanding of the Web2py framework javascript templates, and design, for Joshua and Sidney this was their first hackathon competition!.
