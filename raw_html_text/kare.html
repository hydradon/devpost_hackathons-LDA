                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of Americans don't have access to health care services and even more have to wait extremely long periods of time before they can get access to potentially life saving health services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several famous examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Carrie Fischer passed away after going into Cardiac Arrest on a flight with no doctor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Michael Jackson passed away from cardiac arrest after suffering a fatal combination of drugs and was found by his doctor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What do they have in common, they both passed after suffering fatal health issues with no medical assistance nearby.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Each care unit is designed from a raspberry pi unit, mega ardunio, RFID sensor and Hear Beat sensor. The system uses C.

                    <li>
                        We ran into many issues with configuring the actual hardware (including damaging multiple sensors). We also had issues with designing the system but managed to pull through.
