                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Free speech is something that is constantly taken for granted, but can be easily restricted in the current format our devices communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a platform that shares information via proximity and works entirely offline for an authentic user experience that can't be regulated, censored, or shut-down. This is key in situations where internet connections are heavily monitored, or when infrastructure has been taken down due in disaster relief.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a multi-cast broadcasting system that sends messages between devices via bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged the Google-Nearby-Connections api to detect peers and message them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API we were using is still in development and there are unresolved issues. Additionally, due to it's recent release, there isn't much documentation or example code available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phones can already send information to each other on connection and echo out messages received.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for PeerShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand capabilities to allow more complex message sharing including images.
