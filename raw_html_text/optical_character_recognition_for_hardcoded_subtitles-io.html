                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was for translation applications. Copying a subtitle by hand is very time-consuming, and the existing solutions require large training datasets. We wanted to make a fast

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optical-Character-Recognition-For-HardCoded-Subtitles.io extracts pictures at a fixed sample rate from online video services. It detects subtitles present on the pictures, and extracts the words into a .srt file. It then corrects errors incurred in the transcription process, and provides an option to translate the results.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the bulk of the project in python. We found the opencv, pytesseract, and google-cloud-translate libraries to be very useful in this project. To extract screenshots from video streaming services we used a chrome extension programmed in javascript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the preprocessing for the optical character recognition was daunting, we tried nearly everything we could think of. It was almost unfortunate when our most successful solution used only 4 lines of code, as we had developed a number of interesting techniques.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody had any experience with any of the packages we used, or had any experience at a hackathon or coding competition, so we feel pretty proud just of having a serviceable project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google cloud credits were a great way to explore different Google APIs. More or less everything was relatively novel to us, so we ended up learning a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Optical_Character_Recognition_For_HardCoded_Subtitles.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program still has some difficulty with non-monochromatic text, and text overlaid with artifacts. Logographic languages, such as Chinese, are also difficult. Working out ways to handle these obstacles would be the next step.
