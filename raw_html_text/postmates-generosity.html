                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of interesting ways to use postmates and one thing that we thought was nice, was to be able to donate through this app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This webapps allows you to select a price value of a donation. It will then optimize to find a meal that will fit the range and deliver it to the closest shelter in the user's zone.
