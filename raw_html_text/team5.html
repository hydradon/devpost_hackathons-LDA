                    Inspirations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    7 million people around the world suffer from visual impairment and a one of our team members has a personal connection to this. Seeing the inefficiencies of canes and constant struggles of these people, we created 'this app to remove this "Haze" of struggles these people face on daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aids visually impaired people by helping them navigate through voice control and object recognition (made using a Tensorflow model). We also tapped into sensors on Android phones such as the gyroscope to enhance safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with integrating all these components into one application, and being able to properly test inside the school for GPS asepcts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where this will go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make this a universally accessible application so that as many people as possible can be aided and better integrate and improve the UI for the app.
