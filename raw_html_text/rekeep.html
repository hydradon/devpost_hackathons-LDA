                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we all shop and thought it would be a useful app to have
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    organizes your receipts from your camera and emails

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used Marvel Pop to create the prototype of our app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the prototype often glitched and we had to restart a few times
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    finishing the project in time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how important the issue is and how it affects customers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for reKEEP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    implementing AI to automatically scan the receipts, rather than manually importing it
                </p>
