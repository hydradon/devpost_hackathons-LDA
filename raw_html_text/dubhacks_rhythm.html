                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into DubHacks not knowing each other and formed this team/project through the Team Formation Event. The concept for the game was based on Haley's idea to create a game aimed at elderly users to help improve memory and concentration. The game design that we are presenting today was thought of by Will and Peter. It aims to provide a music memory game that can be enjoyed at all paces of play, especially by elderly users that cannot keep up with fast-paced music games that they would otherwise enjoy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is intended to be a memorization game where colors light up on a game board and as the user plays, the colors create a pattern on the board. It's similar to Simon Says as the user has to remember the pattern as the game progresses. In addition, underneath each correct guess, there's a note that will be played. As a result, when the correct pattern is played, the notes will create a familiar melody, consisting of classic songs that can be enjoyed by people of all generations.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided on using JavaScript to build this project and split individually to create each aspect of the project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us didn't know how to use JavaScript and we were stuck on how to implement and put everything together. Adding the music was difficult since we had to figure out how the Tone.js file worked and get it responding to each button click. Creating the grid how we wanted and getting it to display properly on differently sized windows was difficult as well.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we have produced is the best accomplishment we could have achieved considering the limited amount of time we had to build this project and also having to learning a new technology to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us became exposed to JavaScript, CSS and HTML and communicating as a team to generate ideas and share help.

                    What's next for dubhacks_rhythm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will attempt to finish it, add a nicer interface, and add a multiplayer feature i.e a ranking system among friends.
