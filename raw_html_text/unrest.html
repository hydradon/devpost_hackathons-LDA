                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    America is experiencing one of the most polarizing times of its history. With that comes the opportunity for any person to express his or her thoughts without fear of persecution. With that being said, this right has been used and protected for centuries; however, its forms of utilization have not advanced by much with people still using a megaphone and mob mentality to lead. 
Thusly, our group saw the need for reformation which we could supply with technology. We all have the fundamental right to express our words and thoughts and our application, UnREST, bridges that gap between the protestor and organizer to revolutionize the way the world will protest. This app creates a whole new way of organizing to an archaic system that has relied on bullhorns and megaphones for decades and that can now work on an everyday smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What it does
UnREST&trade; connects organizers to their participants for a significantly less chaotic way to congregate and march with purpose and clarity. Organizers can create and designate routes for protests confidentially using the app and change routes and inform participants as they see fit. Protesters are able to communicate with others and organizers in a more clear and direct way to warn about the obstacles they may find, such as police or counter-protesters using the Twitter chat feature, which can be updated publicly. Participants are also able to keep their confidentiality with the anonymous chat feature that uses a special code for each individual protest. With UnREST&trade;, now citizens everywhere are able to express their opposition and freedom with an app in a safe, systematic, and impactful way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It enables a protest organizer to confidentially manage a protest and its actions including the route and post real-time updates regarding the same.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started from scratch, after a web development boot camp from a simple HTML document. We moved the program to implement CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a new experience for all of us. From starting with HTML, integrating maps, calling in jQuerys, and much much more we learned a lot overnight!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to synthesize the program from the bottom up as we had no experience in web development. We haven&rsquo;t given up, even after 14 hours of coding!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, web development, coding with passion, and managing yourself after 4 cans of Redbull.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UnRest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prioritizing communications is our goal and hence Android and iOS functionality would help protesters connect better. We see this app being used all over the world in various situations for the express purpose of making everyone heard.
