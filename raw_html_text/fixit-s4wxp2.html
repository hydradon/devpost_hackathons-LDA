                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students learning to be socially responsible global citizens, we realized that it's important for all community members to feel a sense of ownership, responsibility, and equal access toward shared public spaces. Often, our interactions with public spaces inspire us to take action to help others in the community by initiating improvements and bringing up issues that need fixing. However, these issues don't always get addressed efficiently, in a way that empowers citizens to continue feeling that sense of ownership, or sometimes even at all! So, we devised a way to help FixIt for them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a way for users to report Issues in their communities with the click of a button. They can also vote on existing Issues that they want Fixed! This crowdsourcing platform leverages the power of collective individuals to raise awareness and improve public spaces by demonstrating a collective effort for change to the individuals responsible for enacting it. For example, city officials who hear in passing that a broken faucet in a public park restroom needs fixing might not perceive a significant sense of urgency to initiate repairs, but they would get a different picture when 50+ individuals want them to FixIt now!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by brainstorming use cases for our app and and discussing the populations we want to target with our app. Next, we discussed the main features of the app that we needed to ensure full functionality to serve these populations. We collectively decided to use Android Studio to build an Android app and use the Google Maps API to have an interactive map display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had little to no exposure to Android SDK before so we experienced a steep learning curve while developing a functional prototype in 36 hours. The Google Maps API took a lot of patience for us to get working and figuring out certain UI elements. We are very happy with our end result and all the skills we learned in 36 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of what we learned, how we grew as designers and programmers, and what we built with limited experience! As we were designing this app, we not only learned more about app design and technical expertise with the Google Maps API, but we also explored our roles as engineers that are also citizens. Empathizing with our user group showed us a clear way to lay out the key features of the app that we wanted to build and helped us create an efficient design and clear display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, this project helped us learn more about the design process, Android Studio, the Google Maps API, and also what it means to be a global citizen who wants to actively participate in the community! The technical skills we gained put us in an excellent position to continue growing!
