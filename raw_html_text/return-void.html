                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows you to travel throughout the solar system while fighting enemies to reach the jump point at the end of the solar system before the sun collapses, returning us to the void.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game Maker Studio 2, GIMP, and Audacity were used in the development of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking was a big issue we had to deal with, as well as bullet path-following algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our online leader board works, allowing for different clients to share the same leader board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about path-following algorithms for our rockets, as well as how to set up a network in GML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Return Void
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some things we would like to implement in the future are allowing for multiple clients to connect at once, as well as adding new enemies and bosses.
