                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tiphy was inspired by the dating app, Tinder, and cute gifs. We decided to combine the two so that you can rate gifs and find like-minded individuals who share your taste in gifs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tiphy provides you with the top five cutest gifs based on other's users ratings. It also matches you with another user that you can chat with via e-mail.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MongoDB for the databases holding users and gifs. We connected it with node js and jade to produce a functional web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never made a website before, so we had to learn everything from scratch. We ran into many difficulties, including the formatting of a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a functioning website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tiphy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is the ability to chat with other users about the GIPHYs, and add in more memes, such as images and text.
