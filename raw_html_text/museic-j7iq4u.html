                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music is incredibly powerful and has the ability to speak to the depths of a person's soul. We wanted to find a more effective way to help people through emotional times and we thought that music would be the most effective way to do so. If we can help people more effectively cope with the lows of life, and fully enjoy the highs that life brings, we can make a positive impact to many people through the power of MUSEic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MUSEic uses Muse headband, Myo armband, an Android application, and Spotify to help determine your current mood, the most appropriate music to play, and provide an immersive experience to play that music in order to help optimize a person's mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with the psychic portion of MUSEic, and dived into the fascinating signals that the Muse produced. Once we could get it to communicate with our laptops, we began to develop our app. We used the Android SDK's from Muse, Myo, and Spotify. The Muse detects our brainwaves that we analyze in order to determine what mood the user is in, the Myo allows us to wirelessly control music playback, and Spotify supplies us with an abundance of playlists and songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting off trying to process all of the signals and determine which brain waves to use from the Muse was our first big challenge. Further along, we ran into problems of connecting 3 SDK's at the same time. Resolving dependencies was literally a living nightmare. However, we finally overcame then and successfully used all 3 SDK's to their full potential. UI was something we had a bit of trouble spicing up, as none of us had experience in Android Studio UI design before. This was more of a cosmetic issue, however, and doesn't affect functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together as a team in order to bring a dream from an idea to a physical product. We split up the work, developed separate parts independently, and came together at the end to make a pretty well working Android app. We had an abundance of talent in our team, from idea developers to implementers, all of us had plenty to contribute to our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting at least some sleep helps immensely with productivity. Being sleep deprived makes you much more prone to errors, and being more well rested allows you to not make as many mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MUSEic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of very lofty goals that just weren't possible for us to accomplish within 36 hour, but we are happy with what we created!
First , because musical preference is so unique to the individual and in order to increase the effectiveness of the music choices, we would want to create an algorithm similar to Pandora or Spotify, that tailors the musical choice to the specific individual, and also to learn more about how the individual responds to music so we can provide better and more personalized solutions to help optimize their mood.
Secondly, we would allow individuals to create their own playlists and would be able to share and create joint playlists with friends. We know how important friends are to our wellness and we want to leverage that resource.
Thirdly, we would want to do more research to see if the MUSE band can detect a wider range of emotions so the treatment can be more than just the 2 variations of happy and sad that we could accomplished. Emotions like anger, stress, depression, loneliness, and anxiety (just to name a few) could be implemented for the emotional roller coaster that life takes us on. 
Also, our User Interface could use some recreating. It is a rather simple interface, and creating a cooler, more advanced one with graphs, images, and icons will make our app provide a more user friendly and immersive experience.
Additionally, we had the idea of integrating our app with Amazon Echo, in order to provide a truly wireless experience, but we will have to wait until Amazon opens up more features to developers in order to fully harness this incredible tool.
Lastly, iOS development would be of great interest as well, since so many people use that platform as well.
