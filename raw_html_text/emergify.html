                </h2>
                <p>
                    My hero is healthcare reporter Sarah Kliff. She is a genius who cares about people, and one time I met her and cried in front of her.

                    Our app provides a platform for people to share their experiences of hospitals, and how much they paid for their experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets consumers know what they could be paying for sets of tests when they go to a hospital in their area.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of them, face first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a functional app, and got Alexa to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so, so much about healthcare, yet somehow almost nothing about healthcare pricing. Lots about ourselves, backend development, and Alexa.
                </p>

                    What's next for Emergify

                <p>
                    Expanding to encompass more types of tests and services, spreading to more cities, and more filtering options, for users to find information tailored to them.
