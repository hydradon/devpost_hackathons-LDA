                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that currently donating things to people affected by natural disasters had two problems: it was slow and inconvenient to do, and if we were to donate, we're not sure of where the money goes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app links you to Amazon, where you personally buy stuff that the disaster victims need, and those things are directly sent to non-profit organizations that would give them to those that need them.
                </p>
