                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the city of Toronto. We wanted to promote crime awareness and community engagement after seeing the detrimental effects of crime on an area called Regent Park.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows community members to flag locations they consider unsafe so that civilians can confidently walk in metropolitan areas. They can also use the app to navigate a safe route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used front-end chatbot using DialogFlow for users to report incidents of crime and check if areas are safe. In addition, the web applications helps users pinpoint and visualize areas where crimes were reported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first time using React, we faced many challenges trying to learn it. Not having prior knowledge using Javascript also added a challenge in learning React. Making the map locate the user devices' location was especially challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much we learned about React. We were really hoping to learn more about front-end technologies, so this was good progress. We also like the twofold of our idea. The way that civilians are compelled to use the app to find safe places (or avoid unsafe places), but they can also report unsafe areas and provide the app with more data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using React to build a front end. We also used the Google Maps API for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Neighbours Helping Neighbours
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would want to add an algorithm to better identify the unsafe places using the tags. This would need to account for the type of crime, the degree of the crime, and who may be reporting it.
