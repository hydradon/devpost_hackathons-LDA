                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this project due to the motivation/goal that we would be able to make an entire private network for us and our friends given enough time and resources
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>**HackPixel** is the framework for a Minecraft server to be built upon, it allows for easy expansion and has some functioning aspects of a large-scale server such as kits, a GUI-based punishment system, and a system in place to make sure that the lobby is not destroyed.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We imported Bukkit into our IDEs while our other teammate, Hayden, began working on a website to go along with the server. We continued to refine it through rigorous testing along with trial and error. We did a lot of research and dug through the library in order to learn more about the library
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> One of the challenges we ran into was actually testing our code, due to the fact that Java needs to be compiled and the server needs to be running to test it. This along with having Minecraft, the server, and our IDEs open was very resource-intensive on our computers and definitely limited us with waiting for things to load and to respond. 
    Another challenge we ran into was our lack of experience in Java. We have picked up the basics of this library and have been learning more as we go on, although we have picked up the basics, our ideas were limited in both function, and time to deploy them, due to our lack of Java skills.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>One of the most difficult parts was making our GUI systems, we had to research ways to do certain things, and we had to implement them to work with our specific situations, it was a time-consuming and annoying process that ended up paying off by elevating the user experience.  
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>There are proper ways to do things, and if you try to take shortcuts, your result may not equal your desired outcome for your code. We had to give up some features in order to make others work, which shows that some features definitely hold more weight or are more valuable than others, and you must decide what will be best for the user and for you, the developer 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackPixel
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We plan to expand it, adding more and more features, such as minigames, ranks, etc. to legitimize it as a quality server and to provide the best user experience. We one day hope to have the server at a point where we can stand high, say that we made it, and have a good time with our friends.
