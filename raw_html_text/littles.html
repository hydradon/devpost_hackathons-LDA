                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my UnCollege Gap Year, we were introduced to the concept of Wins and Littles in spreadsheets.  They allowed us to keep track of the anxieties in our lives that seemed huge at the time, but later were deemed insignificant; and the small accomplishments that brought smiles to our faces.  Wins and Littles were a good way to reflect on our growth and how we changed throughout our gap years and I wanted to introduce an easier solution to that concept through an app.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Littles allows users to log events in their life, positive or negative, and look back on them through the weeks to reflect.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    It was difficult to figure out what to do next every time I finished something.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    Eight weeks ago I had never written in Swift!

                    What's next for Littles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, I'll continue to add more features in the future!
