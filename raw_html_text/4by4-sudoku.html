                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sudoku is a popular game that was started as a puzzle on paper. When formatted for the mobile, the user input was done without any writing. However, with MyScript handwriting recognition technology, that writing part returns to the game. Also, to my surprise, this idea of mine just coincided with the idea presented in the MyScript show-reel video. I was so glad that I was also thinking along the same lines, though it was accidental.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4BY4 Sudoku is a game that anyone can enjoy. Instead of playing standard Sudoku which is played on a 9 by 9 square grid, the player can enjoy a simplified version played on a 4 by 4 square grid. The player can directly write the numbers with the fingers on the mobile's touch screen which are immediately recognized by the app as if by magic. So, this is an awesome user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 25 different games (levels). Each game is a 4 by 4 Sudoku puzzle. The player has to fill in the 4 by 4 grid of squares, using only the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, so that, each number appears only once in each row, only once in each column, and only once in each 2 by 2 sub-grid defined by different shades of green color. Once the correct solution is reached, the player is informed the fact with a message including the time taken to solve the puzzle. The user has to write the numbers on the grid with the finger to enter them into the squares. The player can even save a game and revisit it later. There's also a soothing soundtrack, which helps focus the attention of the user on the task of solving the puzzle.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, I started with a generic sample app provided with MyScript ATK library for Android. Then, I heavily modified and re-engineered it, until it took the shape of my own desired app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was little documentation on certain aspects I was looking for. One thing is that I had to comply with Android programming standards and patterns. The other is that I had to adhere to the requirements of MyScript ATK library. Therefore, I had to compromise some of the fancy features I wanted to add and even look for workarounds, since there was a tight deadline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Within a relatively short time, I was able to come up with a great game that anyone could enjoy playing.

                    I have plans to add more levels (puzzles), and to further enhance the user experience.
