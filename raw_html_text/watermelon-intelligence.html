                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heike stood in front of a smart data dashboard by SAP that visualized any data from an airport interactively at CeBIT and realized that she wanted the same dashboard - but for her private life. In this very moment the idea for Watermelon  was born.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watermelon summarizes your digital traces and offers an objective basis for evaluating your online behavior. Automatically tracked data - time spent on Netflix, likes on Facebook, orders on Amazon, etc. - are being aggregated and visualized in a data dashboard and explored via correlations. It could reveal situations leading to peak consumption, for example. Use Case at //Slash Hackathon: Sleeping Data by SleepCycle (Tracking App)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a sleeping data set (several years) and a weather data set online. We analyzed and visualized with Python. To show the user experience we sketched mockups with Adobe Illustrator.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    finding a use case, finding datasets, finding relevant correlations (data exploration), reading and parsing data, learning python, matplotlib and numpy with no prior knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we found a cool dataset. Analyzing data with python at beginner level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use case is mandatory for limitation and focus. Applying python on a complex data set.
