                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning that FINRA collected data on various datasets, I was interested in mining the data and seeing what I can analyze and see what is useful.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Excel, R, and a Text Editor to read JSON files.
