                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the auto-plant was to help solve the problem of over irrigation which is plaguing our country's water supply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It waters a plant when the moisture of the soil gets too low.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a moisture sensor get analog data varying with soil moisture, it sends it to an Arduino which may or may not turn on a relay that turns on the water pump depending on the soil moisture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned on connecting to a weather API by having another Arduino communicate with a Raspberry Pi but we could not get the Arduinos to communicate with each other with our wireless modules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marwan is proud of the relay and other circuits he made. John is proud of his work on the tubing and drainage system. Mark is proud his work on the drainage system and the Arduino code he wrote. Daniel is proud of his research on APIs and wireless communication, although it failed, he learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about thinking outside the box when it came to the tricky drainage system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Auto-Plant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing wireless communication to incorporate weather APIs. Making a larger scale system with the same concept for lawns, where the real waste of water is made.
