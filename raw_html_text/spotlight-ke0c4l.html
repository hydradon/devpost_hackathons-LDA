                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At events and any other social gatherings with music, the selection of songs to be played are not always chosen by popular opinion, so we wanted to provide a new way for guests to interact and advise the provided DJ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotlight provides interactive experiences for event participants by allowing them to choose what song that the DJ should play next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a REST API with the Java Spring and a static web page provider with Python's Flask Framework. Angular.js was the suitable MVC for our REST client and Spotify's public API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deployment with Cloud providers, Spotify's constraints, coordinating our MVC with our backend, and much more debugging issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us had to work with new tools that we weren't familiar with. We learned much about Google Cloud's App Engine, Compute Engine, and their differences; Spotify's public API; and the Java Spring Framework. We also gained some practice in maximizing work load while minimizing sleep time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spotlight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feature additions including local DJ/playlist results based on the user's location
