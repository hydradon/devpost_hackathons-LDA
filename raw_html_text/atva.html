                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transition between high school and college is difficult, especially with all the newfound freedoms and temptations. It's hard for us to figure it out on our own. We thought that an algorithm that caters to our specific needs would allow everyone to create their own personalized experience and be more productive. It can be hard to act on your own visualizations without a plan in mind in the first place, which is why we made an app to plan everything out for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Atva takes in your scheduled events, such as classes and other planned tasks. It also takes in your unscheduled events, along with certain user-inputted parameters (approx. duration, expected enjoyment, due date, etc.) With that information, it outputs a custom schedule for you to try and manage your time based on your own needs. It avoids any scheduling conflicts, showing you an overview of any upcoming tasks in the forms of a list and a 3-day calendar view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to create the application. First, we outlined our inputs and desired outputs. From there, we worked task by task to produce the end product. The final app uses some external libraries for showing the calendar and and picking the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we ran into was learning how to use Android Studio as well as collaborating through Git. We also ran into issues trying to export the calendar to an ICS file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we completed most of the goals that we set out to accomplish, especially with this being our first hackathon project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of good communication and teamwork, as well as how key perseverance is to success.

                    What's next for Atva

                    Integration with Firebase, creation of a web app, taking in user's study habits, push notifications to remind user of tasks
