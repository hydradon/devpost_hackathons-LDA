                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the variety of food at the Dining Commons sometimes its easy to forgot that not everyone can eat everything. Whats behind a name? Ours means Nutritious and Delicious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an application that runs on both Android and ios, and allows people to view organizational dining locales. It then provides a lot of information based on how healthy the food is, what it contains, and other nutritional facts. We also provide a settings menu that allows students to sort by allergies and dietary preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using react-native and Firebase (a part of the the Google Cloud Platform)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to Firebase and React Native in general, so we ran into lots of API-related problems, because things just didn't work the way we wanted them too...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up with an almost fully functional app that can be deployed not only at our school, but also at other organizations that want to provide its students, or employees with more detailed information. After all, we are what we eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a lot of hard work goes a long way and we were able to get a really good concept and functional application down in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nutricious
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the UI and build in further features such as the ability to easily find friends at lunch and to remind users to maintain healthy eating habits.
