                    Motivation &amp; Inspiration
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We were moved to create TransMap from our own experiences from using public transportation. We wanted to help make mass transit easier for everyone. Waze and its crowdsourcing model further inspired us.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    How it works
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Our initial prototype of TransMap is a web app. Here, a person can click on their transit station in the map and add comments regarding their location. Any type of comments can be written, such as &ldquo;The VTA bus left early&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bus got cancelled&rdquo;, etc. This can prove to be extremely useful for others using the same route. For instance, if a bus arrived early, a user can post this early arrival, notifying others who will be going on the same route. Anyone else clicking on the same location can see all the comments associated with that location.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Technical Details
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We integrated Google Maps' API to provide the map and locations. For server and data handling, we used Firebase.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Challenges
                </h4>
                <p>
                    As we had just learned about Firebase during Spectra's workshop, integrating Firebase with all the other technologies proved to be an exciting challenge.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Future plan
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In the future, a person will be able to select a station from a list of options in based on their current location. Only recent comments will be shown to the user. Comments search customization can also be done using indexing based search words. Payment modes information will be able to be seen at each station. Also, one can filter stations based off of type: train or bus.
