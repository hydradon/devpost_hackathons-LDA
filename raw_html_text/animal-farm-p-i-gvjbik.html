                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may be dating myself here, but I enjoyed the Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was a preteen and saw an opportunity to recreate that through an Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes the user through a series of choices by voice-driven responses to help Farmer MacDonald find his tractor keys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote a script-driven state engine that takes the user through multiple decision points. It maintains an inventory and uses various condition states to generically apply decision logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't sure how best to structure the voice response to the user to naturally solicit a response from the user. I also had difficulty anticipating the ways a user might respond.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a state machine that can be used to author nonlinear stories and can be extended to support business requirements and integrated with LOB back ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to optimize lambda functions and improve response times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Animal Farm P.I.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animal Farm PI serves as a first pass at authoring a nonlinear story. Learnings here help inform how I refine my VUX in future projects.
