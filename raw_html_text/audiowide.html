                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team found common ground in our love for music and decided to help others connect through music. One of the greatest problems we face in the area of music is that we can't find good recommendations for unknown groups. Another huge problem for artists starting out is that it's hard to be discovered even though there may be many that love their music. We wanted to fix that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows users to discover new music. They begin by adding in their favorite artists and genres and based on their favorite artists a page is made so that they can look at similar artists. These similar artists are voted on by other users. This way lesser-known artists can be discovered. They can also look through different music genres and see the most popular artists by each genre and a few of their biggest hits.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by figuring out what pages we wanted, and we each took our own part to make. We each coed our own parts and later put it all together which wasn't always perfect but now it works out most of the time.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Not knowing the language was quite difficult but we all pushed through and learned as much as we could.
Sleep deprivation was also an issue but we still made something incredible. 
We need the USB to see the website, therefore we are unable to link it here but a tutorial in youtube is attached.

                <p>
                    We would like to make it an app and work out all of the kinks in the website. We need to make it more robust in order for it to be used by the public but plans to do this definitely in the works.
