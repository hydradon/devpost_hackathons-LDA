                    What is the problem of the clients?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    They need to get the services and information for their businesses in fast and easy way. They have no time for doing mechanic work. As we know &ldquo;Time is money&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to provide clients with adaptive, informative and customizable interface
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What&rsquo;s the solution?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To organize the sets of service modules which the clients would get depending on their business segment. They would get the suggestions with sets of suitable modules or they would be able to construct and change these sets how they need. There are different functionality for the user&rsquo;s side and administrator&rsquo;s / manager&rsquo;s side.
