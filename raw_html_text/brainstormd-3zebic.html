                    Inspiration - As students interested in the medical device field, we are always looking for new clinical problems to be solved - even like right now in MedHacks. More often than not, it is difficult to actually figure out what these problems are. Even more so, it is difficult to get in contact with clinicians who can guide the project. Medical professionals across the US have first hand experience in the medical field. They all have experienced problems with regards to their practice that limit their ability to fully devote their attention to patient care. Hence, there is a need to develop a platform to connect medical professionals who have identified clinical needs with a qualified team composed of engineers, designers, researchers, and investors that can help the project come to fruition.

                    What it does- The application provides a voting platform where physicians can post problems that other physicians can upvote/downvote to portray the widespread opinion of the severity of this issue. Then, a "design" team is identified that then works with the doctor who will provide their clinical expertise. Finally, venture capitals have access to completed "matches" and observe the progress to identify and source potential ventures for investment.

                    How I built it- Mobile application is developed through XCode and objective-C for certain modules. Additionally, the full web application version utilizes php, html 5.0, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into- Full development of the application was not able to be finished in the 24 hours given. Additionally, legal issues and disclaimers with regard to IP will need to be resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for BrainstorMD- Complete development of mobile and web application + start marketing the application to nearby doctors and students to develop a userbase.
