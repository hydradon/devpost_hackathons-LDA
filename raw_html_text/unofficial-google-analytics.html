                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a normal working day, we were a team of 4-5 people sitting together and had built a website earlier. We were not at all active in checking whether the website is used by ANYONE at all. So we started using Google Analytics for the same. Days passed by, and we were just too lazy to open up the google analytics dashboard everyday and check. Luckily, we had Alexa with us and we wanted something easier for us. Why not just ask Alexa about it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It links with your Google analytics account and lets you configure to any of the multiple profiles/views present in your account completely through voice. You can ask the skill for
                    <strong>
                        the number of page views on any given day or a day range
                    </strong>
                    .
For example :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How many page views did I get
                        <strong>
                            today
                        </strong>
                        ?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many page views did I get
                        <strong>
                            between 5th April and 10th April
                        </strong>
                        ?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many page views did I get
                        <strong>
                            since last Saturday
                        </strong>
                        ?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the backend, I chose
                    <strong>
                        Python
                    </strong>
                    as the preferred coding language, and luckily, Amazon already has an
                    <strong>
                        Alexa skills kit
                    </strong>
                    example for Python. I then connected my code to the
                    <strong>
                        Google Analytics API
                    </strong>
                    for querying. The skill also uses a bit of
                    <strong>
                        Amazon's DynamoDB
                    </strong>
                    to store the user's view/profile ID, so that it runs smoothly without the user asking to configure every time.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa's DATE type slot always takes the future dates, for example if I say 5th April, it considers it as  5th April,2018 as the date has already passed by. I noticed this a bit later, and then manipulated it at back end.
