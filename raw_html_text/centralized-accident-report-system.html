                    When an EMT is in the ambulance, he/she will proceed through three different "pages" filling out the injured's information. This information will be submitted to a database, which will process it. Based on the patient's severity level and hospital load capacity, the database will re-route the ambulance and alert the hospital of the upcoming arrival.

                    We collaborated through IntelliJ and the plugin Floobits, which allowed us to have a live workspace. We divided up the work between the four of us evenly. We used a MongoDB for the server database and JavaFX as a client side framework. Maven was used to manage projects, to allow the team to easily and dynamically add dependencies. We also used a tool called "SceneBuilder" to design our GUIs.

                    There were few challenges that severely set us off track. Mostly we ran into issues with lack of knowledge. 
We had no idea how to use a mongoDB server when we started this project. We now have learned to use the database for complex object serialization and using collections. 
In the end we had a centralized server which manipulated a mongodb database and sent data to all clients involved.
