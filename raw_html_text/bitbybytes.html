                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us have gone out on a night and have either spent more than we wanted to or have had a friend spend way too much money. It's never fun realizing you have less money, so we considered a responsible way to combat this issue for any and all events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This feature allows people who are conscientious of their spending habits to create a budget specific to certain events where they only want to spend a certain amount. By checking the available spending amount in the user's checking account and ensuring the budget does not conflict with any subscription payments or take the user's available cash to a low amount, this feature lets the user define how much they are willing to spend for an event of their choice. While normal expenses will be restricted once you go over budget, emergency purchases will still be allowed such that the user will not be penalized for unfortunate circumstances or poor spending habits. In doing this, the feature helps users enforce spending restrictions in a way where they can help themselves if they want to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Capital One's Imagine Banking API, we imported its SDK into Android Studio. Then, we separated the different accounts of the customers into three activities: CreditActivity, CheckingActivity, and SavingsActivity. We then used Android's XML design to edit the page layouts of these three activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Saving's Interactive button utilizes Android's intent to go from the button press to the the user's Savings account. The page displays the current balance of the customer's savings account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was cloning the imported Android project into each of our laptops. Because of different OS's and different versions of Android Studio, the build gradle file wasn't functional in the other team members' machines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In regards to the design, custom styles (i.e. color schemas different from the default project theme) were not usable. We then had to reset and go through each of the layout elements and set them to default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the Manifest file did not include permission to access the INTERNET, which further hindered compiling the gradle file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our teamwork, within short amount of time we knew each other. We each contributed to coming up with ideas and on the day of were committed to changing short notice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better work in a team and how to organize many moving parts of a team on short notice. We learned more about our weaknesses and the amount of work and effort needed to actually develop a fully functioning application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BitbyBytes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the feedback for this idea from Capital One is positive then we will continue to develop the application and fully flesh out a functional working android prototype and continue working in accordance with Capital One implement it in Capital One's current mobile application.
