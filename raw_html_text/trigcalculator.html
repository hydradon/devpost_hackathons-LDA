                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently taking trigonometry at school and was asked to find cotangent of 50 degrees for my math homework. However, my calculator did not have a button to do that! I wanted to make a calculator that did have buttons for the other three trig functions, secant, cosecant, and cotangent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs an angle measure in radians, then selects which trig function they want the value of. The program returns that value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this program using Java in Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The default Math functions only took in radians, so my program is limited to taking in radians.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a functional program, although it is not user proof.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to import images into Java! I also learned how to organize all the JPanels.
                </p>

                    What's next for TrigCalculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make it work with degrees, and also make buttons around the picture of the unit circle to auto select angle measures.
