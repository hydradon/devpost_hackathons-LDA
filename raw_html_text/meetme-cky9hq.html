                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the past decade, technological improvements have decreased people's drive to meet new people. We wanted to try to bring people together by matching them up with potential friends based on similar interests from Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows the user to input a specific interest that he/she/other has, and will generate a list of current and potential friends that share the same interest as specified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using the Ionic and Angular frameworks, as well as integrating the Facebook Graph API into the app natively. We also used HTML and SCSS to format the application's UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into was integrating the Facebook authorization into the Ionic 2 and Angular 2 Frameworks, as they do not offer much documentation and are fairly new. Furthermore, we had to properly install all the plug-ins and configurations necessary without any helping documentations to tell us what to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were successful in integrating both Facebook authorization as well as the Facebook Graph API natively into our application relatively smoothly, as well as completing an application using frameworks and languages we were fairly unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with the Ionic Framework as well as the Facebook API's, as well as gaining exposure to Angular 2 and HTML.
                </p>

                    What's next for MeetMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future updates, we plan to integrate a event planning system, allowing users to plan events based solely on interest, and allowing users in specified distance range to join the event.
