                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students no matter who they are enjoy ease of use. With this system, registration becomes much easier and less time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to sign into lectures, seminars and tutorials just by enabling Bluetooth at the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth API to detect bluetooth devices that once linked to a student, can be used to sign into lectures, seminars and tutorials without doing more than enabling bluetooth
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally intended on using Java however as the current Raspberry Pi 3 does not support javac this halted this method and forced us into using Python; a language which none of us have much experience with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to produce something which we honestly believe will make a difference. More than a simple in and out system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the hackathon it feels like we have all learned another language; Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bluetooth Registration System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to get the university involved so that they can implement this into everyday life at uni making student life a little bit easier and a little bit less wasteful with paper
