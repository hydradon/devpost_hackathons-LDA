                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dining out can take a big bite out of your budget. We've all had a friend (or been there ourselves) who tried to make it through an entire Howdy Week without paying a dime for a meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also know that organizations are eager for students to attend their events and informationals. Especially recently, it's pretty hard to walk around campus just minding your own business without hearing "CLASS OF 23?!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    We realized that there is no well-defined central hub to facilitate trades between these two parties: in particular, the trade of student attendance for free food. Hungry Ags exists to fill this void.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hungry Ags is a web app that allows students with a hunger for free food to find organizations with a desire to provide it. We take advantage of what seems to be a constant cycle of organization recruitment to facilitate win-win trades between organizations and students. And who knows, the student might stick around and find out that they liked more than just the food at the event, and end up joining!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hungry Ags is built on top of Angular and Angular Material. We used fullcalendar, the most popular Javascript calendar framework, to handle event dates/times since they are notoriously difficult to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge we ran into was that of clean responsive design. As soon as we built something that worked great on desktop, it was almost a process of rebuilding it entirely for it to look good on mobile. Still, we knew this was important, since a large part of our user base will be using mobile. Our other challenge was making simultaneous edits. As a whole, we are still familiarizing ourselves with the intricacies of Git, and not all of us are great at avoiding merge conflicts. Without a doubt, we improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment we are most proud of is that we have a fully functional MVP to present today. In particular, the filter functionality and the login/authentication flow are accomplishments we are proud of. Further, we are proud of the idea itself. Each of us feels that it has a unique real-world use-case that we could see ourselves finding .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us learned a ton about Angular and web development. Some of us were more experienced than others prior to the hackathon, but each of us has become more proficient. Further, as already mentioned, we learned a lot more about collaborating on software projects in real-time with Git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hungry Ags
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that mobile apps are extraordinarily popular among college students, and therefore our immediate next step is to develop an iOS app followed by an Android app. Beyond that, we want to look at automating various flows, such as adding an organization for emails that are officially tied to the organization in the directory, etc.
