                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To develop this project we got the inspiration by noticing the rural areas people without internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In simpler terms, it creates a local interweb which enables the rural areas' residents to consume internet data without even getting connected to the internet with the features like caching website offline video watching and chatting too without internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Central Hub (acting as server for the interweb)
We created a system as a server which will act as a server for the entire interweb. Any content to be shared with the interweb will be present in this system. This is the only device(system) that needs to be connected to internet whenever something new is to be downloaded. The entire architecture will still be up even if this system loses internet access, just that it won't be able to download any new material. It can still provide all the inter-connected devices data for consumption without internet connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client Side application
We created a web application that's accessible from literally any device that supports a browser. The web application accesses the data available on the local server and consumes it as if it's available on it's own machine only. Client web application also enables users to communicate with the admin as well as other registered users. Users don't need to register in order to consume videos / cached websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Architecture Setup of interweb
We tried different tools available for sharing localhost over the same network, finally stuck with the wifi sharing over the same network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming up with different use cases / utilities using the interweb
We did extensive discussions and brainstorming over the different utilities we could provide using this locally connected interweb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Content Moderation
To moderate the content being sent by users over messages, we have designed our own customized admin dashboard, where admin can see all the requests that have been raised so far, or any kind of messages that people have sent to the admin, specifically. Admin also possesses the ability to delete any offensive content being transmitted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GramConnect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automated Content Moderation
As of now, there has to be one person controlling each central hub. Going forward, we can even eliminate this person's role to certain limit by adding automated content moderation using machine learning algorithms. Training of the model can be done by observing the patterns and user actions taken by this person when using in manual mode of moderation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2-way content sharing
We can later enable 2-way sharing of files in which users can even upload files which they want to be accessible on the interweb (this content will be suitably moderated, of course!).
