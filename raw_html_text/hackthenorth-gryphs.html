                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As distance increases between people, Facebook has kept friendships together. These dispersed friend groups are looking for ways to stay connected. Meeting face-to-face virtually, is an amazing tool to maintain this human connection. As friends become increasingly busy in their lives, we become separated and lose some of the connections we have. We don't get to spend as much time together. Having a space where we can virtually hang out with and connect with our friends allows us to maintain subtle human connections that can't be replicated with text or calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FaceChat allows friends to connect in more human ways which are lost in text and calls. We achieve this connection by providing a virtual space to spend time, laugh, play and make memories together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity to build the VR and interface. We also used the Facebook SDK for Unity to get your friends information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with Unity before and it was quite the learning curve. Also the Facebook integration took a while to understand. The Facebook security measures made it difficult to rapidly prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Unity for the first time and make significant progress in developing a 3D world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make Unity games. We learned how to make VR spaces with Unity. We also learned a lot about team work and working together in high intensity situations over a long period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackTheNorth-Gryphs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue expanding FaceChat to make it a fun and interactive experience for friends and family to maintain connections with each other. We plan on adding games that can be played within the VR setting with close friends.
