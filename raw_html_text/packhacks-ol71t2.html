                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the desire of kids to enter pantries each night to grab a snack. However, sometimes they would have to sneak through the kitchen. Thus, a game must be made out of this.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is currently an entertainment based game. The goal of the game is to entertain users through multiple levels, and provide them with some music to lighten the senses. Overall, the game is meant to provide a good laugh and fun to any user.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Kitchen Escape by using a combination of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Vectr. We also hosted our game on kitchenescape.net, using Domain.com

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of our code being deleted spontaneously for no apparent reason. We also had the dilemma of coming up with a game that was fun and relatable for all ages. In addition, we had a domain and were having trouble using the address and connecting it to our github repository
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of integrating music, custom maps designed by hand, and a flawless system that allowed us to work in sync.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that javascript can be used in both the back end and front end of. We also learned how game engines are integrated into a game environment. In addition, we learned Machine Learning at a workship early in the morning.
