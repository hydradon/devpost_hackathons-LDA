                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fleet Assistant is an application solution that is very useful for fleet management in the transportation sector. Been able to retrieve fleet data using voice user interface with artificial intelligence, in addition to the use of screen visualizations.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is useful for managing a fleet of vehicles (vehicles, trucks, buses, to name just a few). In connected trucks, for example, it is important to get out the data from the trucks, to make transient statistics. Also, the fleet owners can use the data to be more efficient in their daily operations, saving fuel consumption, learning about the driver's behavior and encouraging driver's to drive safely and smoothly without breaking too much. The use case for building this fleet management application and the backend solution will help the fleet owners and drivers to be more efficient in their daily work.By that I am enhancing the concept of connected vehicle into connected drivers. So more social engagement between the commercial drivers and the fleet owners. LTE and LTE-M are very useful for machine to machine (M2M) or device to device connectivity. The fleet owners also have an administrator or transport planner that use the fleet management portal and voice or virtual assistant. So they can see if the driver is online through both web and voice solutions.

                <p>
                    We connected the sensors and cellular IoT gateway to the Verizon cloud and utilized the device management APIs to POST data to the platform. Using the GET API to retrieve the data and display on a FREEBOARD dashboard for visualizations as well as using Google Assistant to get vital information about the vehicles. A new experience in addition to using the screen for visualization in the control centre.

                    To add more features to the solution. Utilizing more APIs like the SMS API for sending messages. It will be nice to send messages to the driver through this solution and the drivers can communicate between each other, one-to-one or via group conversation. They can upload pictures for damaged goods and they can also have locations and push notifications sent to the driver if the driver is not available. A driver can be in the tunnel or on top of a mountain where he cannot be reached. Through reliable messaging with push notification, message can be sent to the driver and whenever he comes back online, he can receive the message.
