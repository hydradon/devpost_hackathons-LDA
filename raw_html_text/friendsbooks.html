                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Books are slowly disappearing. Maybe because they can be a bit expensive, or just because the digital devices are taking over. But we believe in sharing to give them a future!
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Simply log in on our website using your Facebook login, take a photo of your bookshelf with your smartphone, and get started right away! You'll be able to see your friends' books, request a loan,...

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a picture is uploaded, we first query Microsoft Computer Vision API to extract the text from your photo, then query Google Books API to find out informations about your books. The books per user as well as loans are stored in our SQL database, that is queried using Python. The webapp is built using React.
                </p>
