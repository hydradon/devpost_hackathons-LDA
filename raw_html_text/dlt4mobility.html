                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current mobility systems are isolated, slow and manual. Customers cannot have a seamless access to different transportation systems, an approach already adopted in other technology areas (e.g. laptops/tablets/phones are used interchangeably today for most taks).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Service gateway for 3rd party providers to offer services on top of a DIDs management platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docker-compose local setup based on Idchain public repository plus Android mobile phone application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Difficulties setting the development scenario locally (hashtax/idchain).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definition of a usecase in which decentralised identity is key. Using a mobility oriented network as a backbone, multiple 3rd party providers can implement their own business model on top.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple interfaces require further work in order to be able to integrate all functionalities (micropayments, DIDs, mobile application APIs, etc).
                </p>

                    What's next for DLT4Mobility
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a Service gateway for 3rd party providers to be able to offer own services benefiting of the Issuers/Verifiers network.
