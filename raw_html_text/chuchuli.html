                    Venetian Knight

                <p>
                    Let's make Finances fun again!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of the game is pretty simple and straightforward. survive the wars, famine, taxation and plague and be able to have at least 100 warriors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have an access to a marketplace, where you learn the basics of free market, how demanding more resources will make each of them much more expansive, while putting all your resources for sale at once will result in extremely cheap prices and few gold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also have a risk assessment: Is it ok to have faith less then 50%? or influence less then 60%? would you spend money on Pope of Rome and/or on a king, or should you spare your money, while risking finding yourself on a single slot with witches or plague?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is any game without some bad neighbours? you will have to have a permanent army, in case neighbour attacks or you will have a chance to get more money by attacking them yourself? This gives us a chance to make a feature of multiplayer in a game, making it much more interesting and entertaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, do not forget that everything is about a golden balance, you should have enough peasants to make crop and meat production as affective as possible, and  keep in mind!!! too much human resources with not enough food will result in famine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good luck Sir knight!!! We hope to see you stronger and richer than ever!
                </p>
