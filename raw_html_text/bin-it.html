                    We created a game about recycling, on par with the apparent theme of many teams here- we are glad it's on our collective conscience! Currently, widespread improper sorting of waste causes problems in all systems of waste management. Hopefully when people play "BIN IT!" they will learn to dispose of trash responsibly. BIN IT! was made using pygame. In the game, there are various items that the player needs to dispose of properly- they belong in compost, recycling, or hazardous waste disposal. If you use the recycling bin, for example, to catch a glass bottle, you get a point, but if you try to catch a banana peel, then you lose a point because that item belongs in compost. At the end there is a short summary of what should be in each category. An ideal version of this game would include more items that are commonly incorrectly sorted, such as milk cartons, which are no longer recyclable in many locations across the US. Also, this game would ideally have settings that differentiate based on what town you select, because recycling guidelines differ by area.
