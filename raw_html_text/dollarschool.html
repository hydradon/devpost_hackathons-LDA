                </h2>
                <p>
                    CarpeDime is a chrome extension that promotes students' self awareness of the amount of money they're spending to attend college.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many people were looking at Facebook during the hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension reads in students' Google calendar under permission and tuition paid to provide unit price of class. The extension enables whenever a student is visiting a site that he shouldn't be in class and then displays how much money is wasted every second when the student is on a site he shouldn't be on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server is running on Node.js and client side is Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, CSS, and HTML. We began with the manifest.json to set up the basic extension, and then we created the page_action modules, popup.html, background.js, popup.js, and other files necessary for a basic Chrome extension. Additionally, we set up a Node.js server that serves as the backend of the extension where we can get access to a user's Google calendar with their authorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google calendar API surprisingly did not have an endpoint to get the duration of an event. We later discovered that converting an event startTime from a dateTime to a Date was the key to this issue. The Date class offers much greater capability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully built this with minimal setbacks and minimal time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JSON is pretty cool. We also lose a lot of money per minute of schooling. Better not waste time Facebooking! Carpe Diem!
