                    ReaX is a dynamic prescription tool that consists of an app, managed by the medical provider, and a box, handed to the patient. Once a signal is received by the app, the box will start the alarm, which has both visual and auditory aspects to accommodate blind or deaf patients. The alarm is our solution to the issue of forgetfulness, and it relieves the patient of having to remember the different times of taking different medicines, as the patient may have several prescriptions lined up, and ReaX can currently hold up to 2 different medicines. The box also has LEDs to point to a particular medicine, with the LEDs lighting in a pattern that shows the amount of dosage required, along with labels inside that clearly state the number of pills required per dosage, so that the patient is relieved of having to remember the dosage amount. Furthermore, to ensure that the patient has actually opened the box to take the pill, we installed an Arduino with a light sensor on the inside of the box, which sends a signal to the app whenever it detects light, which means that the box is opened, allowing the app to start the count that&rsquo;ll eventually lead up to determining when a refill is needed. Once a refill is required, the app, once integrated with CVS&rsquo;s systems, will place an order of a delivery of a refill to the patient&rsquo;s home, relieving the patient of going to the drug store to get a refill. Simply put, ReaX is a caretaker that combats forgetfulness, disorganization, and confusion.
