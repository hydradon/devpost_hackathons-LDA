                    Inspiration:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was our background. Our background is in India, where all our parents were born and brought. Many of our relatives were living in India, and so we would often visit, and feel the obvious difference in the thickness of the air. Every time we went there we would feel and struggle with the poor air quality. After a recent trip to India, we realized that it was time to make a difference, so we felt inspired to create an app that spreads awareness about bad situations related to air in other countries.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app is a way of spreading awareness through an enthralling game, in an effort to reach a bigger crowd, in hopes of having more acknowledgement on the negativity and harm that is caused because of global warming. Our app is a way of sharing ideas on how each person can make a bigger difference.

                    Our Building Strategy:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We constructed our app using MIT app inventor, and a lot of Scratch. We hope to later incorporate java, and html to make our program spread to websites, and improve our overall program.

                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, but our biggest challenge was the beginning. We weren't sure how to start, questioning our ideas and worrying that we wouldn't make a good enough app, but we worked through it, using a lot of team encouragement, and solidifying and confirming our idea.

                    Accomplishments:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our idea. In the beginning we didn't know whether our idea could work, wondering whether we could target such a big problem, but we soon realized, that making an app that relates to several people is better than anything. We realized that we were able to reach a large amount of people, and we were attacking a big problem, something we are passionate about.

                    We learned a lot of new things about scratch, and ourselves. We learned that working as a team is the best, and that we need to always improve and expand our app.
