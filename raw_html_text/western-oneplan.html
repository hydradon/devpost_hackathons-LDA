                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As current first-year Western students, transitioning into post-secondary, the thought of financial literacy and paying for school was an incredibly daunting task. Resources felt out of reach and we saw an issue with the lack of consolidation with all our fees associated with the school.  Different platforms were utilized and often times students are too lazy to pay attention and often lacked any knowledge of their financial spendings. We didn't know where what average spendings were, areas we needed to improve and resources available to students (loans, counseling, financial services). Thus, OnePlan was born

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Western OnePlan consolidates all of a basic first-year student's financial needs. Connects to the student's tuition account, housing, and meal plan money. Additionally, we saw a gap in 1st-year students who were coming in without the knowledge of topics such as loans, payment, and additional fees. Combine with how students don't want to be logging into three different domains to find more information, most students are disregarding the thought of costs and fees. The platform combines everything and allows students to navigate all their financial information in one area. Providing that ease of convenience as well as an abundance of knowledge to help them navigate their 1st year at Western!

                    Thinking about an issue that we wanted to tackle with our hack, and creating a feasible idea that could be implemented.
