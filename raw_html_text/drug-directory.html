                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its the need of the hour to increase awareness about drugs among people so that people could know about the drugs they are taking, its proper usage and what could be the side effects of that. If the Information about drugs would be handy to people then it would help them to keep better track of what they are intaking and how it is affecting them.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Drug directory
                    </strong>
                    would enable users to get the details of any drug on the go. It would provide users the usage, side effects, and other related information about any drug.

                <p>
                    I have built it using
                    <strong>
                        Alexa Skill Kit, APL
                    </strong>
                    and using
                    <strong>
                        AWS
                    </strong>
                    for hosting lambda functions.

                <p>
                    In future, a feature could be added to Drug Directory to keep track of drugs a user is taking and if it is in properly taken and if it going to produce any side effects.
