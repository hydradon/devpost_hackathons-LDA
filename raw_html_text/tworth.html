                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone complains when an application either requires a player to make an in app purchase to progress or allows others to get ahead through in app purchases, but everyone loves tweeting! So why not make your tweets have worth?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twitter's API to allow users to redeem their tweets via our own API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the server and authenticating using Twitter's API were the largest challenges we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing our tweets getting redeemed in the demo application we made was a huge accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot was learned through making the demo application and the Tworth API such as: creating servers, game design, pseudo-wave functions, and UI creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tworth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current version of Tworth only searches tweets for keywords, and this could lead to issues when someone tweets "I hate the game
                    <em>
                        insert key word
                    </em>
                    ". In the future, Tworth will be able to analyze the tweets and decide whether or not it deserves the payment.
                </p>
