                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was expressing discontent for the apartment hunting process. In order to get the "perfect" place, it's almost necessary to connect with a real estate agent to leverage their knowledge and connections. But why not automate that entire process and use a voice assistant to simplify the heavy time investment? All the data is out there; we just need to aggregate, filter, and present those property recommendations in a palatable way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user initiates conversation with Alexa by requesting a residence with certain criteria like price, location, etc. The MLS real estate list is queried with the defined criteria. After some data processing, the user is presented with the ideal 3-5 residences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hosted on AWS Lambda, written using Node.js. Details of properties is queried with the Zillow API. We use the Twilio API to send a link to the resulting properties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no free API for public property listing data. The data that was available was not granular enough to our liking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an Alexa Skill that solves a real world problem. We were able to integrate multiple services like Zillow and Twilio in our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the real estate business and how to leverage different software tools to facilitate the interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Realty R Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to utilize a more complete listings database. We want to further develop our product by adding more criteria and data to narrow down better results. We also want to implement a business plan that scales to the entire nation and and implement a pricing plan.
