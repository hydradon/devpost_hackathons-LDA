                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few years ago, a relative of one of our team members got a stroke. Luckily, he was taken to the hospital in time. Unfortunately, many people are not lucky enough to reach their loved ones and receive treatment in time. We wanted to create an app to combat this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very simple Android app with which a user can preset information (such as contact information, medical information, etc.). During an emergency, the user would only need to press down on the large red HELP button in order contact his or her family or friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android and using Twilio to send the message. The application also use the gps location from the phone and send it to receiver in order to call for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to implement both texting (SMS) and facebook messaging, but ran into a lot of trouble with both. We ultimately decided to scrap the facebook part and just focus on the SMS portion of our project.
We were working with Twilio but have several issues with Twilio sdk. Unfortunately, we didn't find anyone with Twilio and Android experience to help.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed the GUI and location retriever for the app. Even though we didn't finish SMS function but we learned about RESTApi and Twilio. We learned more about Android development and worked as a team. We won the cup stacking challenge.

                    We learned about package management and the important of api documentation.  The most important is everyone learned and had f

                    We want to finished the Twilio function and expand the project to send notification on multiple platform. Ideally, the app can also send notification by sms, email and facebook.
