                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dandelions and features that can be implemented through the Magic Leap.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Petal Tones is an interactive musical environment for producers and consumers to experience a new form of entertainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create a 3D space in which a user can walk around and interact with dandelion seeds floating in the air. We used music software, Ableton Live, to create sounds and background elements within the 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty working with the unity program to produce audio samples and getting it to function consistently. We overcame this with research and help from mentors at the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of overcoming difficult challenges during the process. We were able to produce all of the sounds from scratch and put together a 3D landscape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, we learned a lot about C#, Unity, and working with augmented reality. These items took a lot of diligence to use and required extensive research. We learned about sound production and building interactive environments in 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Petal Tones
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to make the project even more interactive by using hand gestures and motion to affect the way that things move in the 3D space. We'd like to work on more interactive ideas with music and augmented reality, like using 3D space to play instruments or design art.
