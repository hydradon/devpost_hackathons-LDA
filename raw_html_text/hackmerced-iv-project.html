                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One inspiration for this project was a simple browser game on the web.  The player controlled a turret under attack from different colored enemies.  Red enemies could only be damaged by red lasers, blue by blue, etc.  Another inspiration was the agar.io game that was a trend in 2015.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a game where the player controls a black square trying to avoid random brightly colored squares bouncing around the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built in Java, using 12 classes, 1 package, and 1 enumeration.  Each class controlled a different aspect of the program.  5 specifically each controlled one type of colored square.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we wanted to make the player square change colors so that it could avoid being damaged when touching squares of the same color.  However, coordinating the keyboard inputs with the display was surprisingly difficult, and we had to abandon that concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project was an accomplishment.  We had several different ideas besides this one, but ColorDodge panned out the best.  This should be especially impressive considering that 24 hours ago we had no idea how to even open a separate window from the programming terminal.  Both learning and creating the entire program was done in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to open a separate window as previously stated, along with generating objects within that window and dictating their interacting with said window and each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ColorDodge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue trying to change the player square color, in order to add a new distinctive dynamic to the game.  We also would like to integrate a colored bullet system into the game like the browser inspiration, but even with our limited initial knowledge, we knew that that would not be something we could learn and/or utilize in 36 hours.
