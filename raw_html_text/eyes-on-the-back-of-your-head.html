                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It had limited materials and I worked one a similar, much less in-depth project last year in school. I was also inspired, being in the city of Philadelphia, where many people walk home alone at night in the dark or walk in parks like Fairmount park in the early morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects motion behind the wearer and alerts you that someone or something is behind you. If he/she gets too close, you, a panic sound will play so that you are aware of your surroundings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the arduino ide to do all the programming along with some inexpensive hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have enough time to make a more tidy, visually appealing 3-D model to be printed, so I had to use a box along with wire cutters to cut the rather hard cardboard.There were also many hardware parts and miscellaneous things I expected to be available (zip ties, rulers,breadboards, etc) which weren't. I also barely even got a ping distance sensor. There were none on the first day and I was only able to get one during the afternoon of the second day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally spent the entire first day and much of the second attempting to figure out android things and the development for it. I wanted to do object tracking but ran into many obstacles. There were times when I wasn't sure I would have a project by the time it was due, but this idea came to me and I think I was able to execute very well on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I really enjoy using the arduino idea
                </p>

                    What's next for Eyes on the Back of Your Head
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to make it more compact and portable. I would like for it to be attachable to your normal backpack or purse.
