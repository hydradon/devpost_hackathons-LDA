                    Our project was inspired by the Australian bush fires emergency relief efforts. This segued us into a wider view of helping people get back on their feet in a time of crisis, no matter what kind of crisis it is.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were very familiar with web development. Two of our members had never encountered React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, at least from a programming standpoint. Additionally, they were both first-timers to hackathons. This proved challenging for having such a short timeframe--in addition to the hack, our two first-timers also had to have a crash course on React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from the other members. Luckily, we were able to guide each other and have a better understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we had some trouble staying fully awake--but nothing some good caffeine can't handle! However, we slept in shifts to be sure to take care of our bodies so we're in a good condition to drive the long 8-hour drive back to Oklahoma after the hackathon is over!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of fun learning and developing a website, and we all did a combination of learning back-end and front-end programming. Our two hackathon first-timers had a great experience!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>
                    What's the next step for "Next Steps"?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to refine both the back-end and front-end programming (especially so because Domain.com has provided us with our free "out of this world" domain name!) and extend the search refine function to allow for an optional input of the user's location to better refine and localize search results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wish to add a way for users to provide feedback on the results given--were they helpful, were they what they were looking for? Did they have advice for better solutions?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, we want to add an element of localization into different languages, using a button on the top right to translate the website into other languages.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Acknowledgements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just want to say a big thank you to the staff, volunteers, judges, and sponsors of TAMUhack! You're the team that makes it happen, and as two of our members are also hackathon organizers, we know that so much goes into running these events to make it run as smoothly as possible to ensure everyone has a great time. We had a long drive, but it was so, so worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we're more than happy to say--
                    <strong>
                        thank you!
                    </strong>
