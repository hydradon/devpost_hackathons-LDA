                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of work done to detect fake news and fake video, but not enough to detect fake voices which is extremely dangerous for people's reputations.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A chrome extension will alert you while watching a video if it detects the audio is fake/synthesized or real.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We use multiple 1D convolutional neural network layers followed by two fully connected layers and a third fully connected output layer. We implement the model architecture with Keras. Our approach achieves 94% binary classification accuracy on the

                    dataset, making it excellent at detecting most synthesized voices. We used the Chrome API on a front-end app to create the chrome extension. The chrome extension notices when you land on a youtube video, takes the ID of the video, makes a request to a Flask Server, the server downloads the youtube video and converts it to an audio file, then converts it into a Numpy set of sound waves, which is fed through the model, and the result is returned to the extension.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome Extension Devtools was awfully buggy. Deploying the application. Converting the downloaded file into Audio. Deploying the model.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Extremely good results on our neural network when we only started researching an architecture on the bus ride here. Very pretty chrome extension. Very complex software system.
