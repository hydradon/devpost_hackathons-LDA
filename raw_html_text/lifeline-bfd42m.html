                    Safety. According to Maslow, this is one of our basic needs. LifeLine, a lifeline for people in need. The origin of the app came from a sign inside the building that said: "pull to start fire alarm". We wondered why the sign was brightly lit. We realized that some houses back last year were burned down due to the PG&amp;E fire. We thought, "Why didn't the firefighters get there quicker? There were many houses near the origin point of the fire but the firefighters came too late. Why didn't the people close by not alert the feds or other neighbors?" We also thought about all the shootings in the past year, like the Vegas shooting, and how no one called the authorities.  We realized we could make an app about this subject. Our app gives you the opportunity to contact an important person or the authorities in times of danger. You can automatically send them a pre-programmed text message or call them just with the click of a button. Also, the app provides an alarm to notify others around you in the case of a fire.
