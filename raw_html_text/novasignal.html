                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Satellite communication right now relies on sending data through one low-frequency streams. But, as the demand for data traffic increases, we can create a mesh network powered by laser-transmitted data to connect them to the Earth. We wanted it to be easier for people to communicate with satellites by allowing them to control the systems in a more safe manner.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An easy to use, streamlined web interface was developed in order to have students easily control satellites through lasers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduinos, servos, lasers, photoresistors, along with different software components such as Vue.js and Flask and serial communication in order to bridge the gap between hardware and software.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Developing a custom serial protocol.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Writing machine learning to recognize planets due to the lack of data available\
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Utilizing Google Cloud Platform because it was very time-consuming to set up the machine from scratch and there were firewalls that took a long time to reload and often were not reliable.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
