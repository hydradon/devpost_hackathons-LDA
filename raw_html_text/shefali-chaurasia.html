                    Inspiration- In the corporate world, many of us have a travel job. In that case we are unable to maintain our health and are not able to go to our regular gym. The idea of fitness pass is that instead of subscribing to your local gym, you subscribe to this Application on a monthly basis. You can look for a gym/ fitness class wherever you are in the country and book it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- Currently the app gives an option to the customers to search for a local gym by city and book it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- It is a very basic functionality using LM.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- Mapping issues, how to tie the whole thing together to make it run.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I was able to put together something
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Basics of LM tool
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shefali Chaurasia: I would like to practice and build more applications on LM, so that i could create complex applications and also complete this Fitness Pass app in a proper way. Fitness Pass should be able to search by zipcode and allow subscriptions.
