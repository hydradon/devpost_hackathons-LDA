                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The consistently limited comprehensive sexual education for the youth in school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a quiz that offers ten (10) questions about things you may not know about sex.  Once the quiz is complete, it will let you know your score and inform you of some extra resources for you to learn more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the quiz action, the score keeping function, and the results.  This ultimately would result in an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges were initially learning how to use the program, learning how to use GitHub collaboratively, and getting the test to be able to restart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A COMPLETED APP!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android studio and more about each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How Sexy Are You??
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, with the next update, HSAY will be able to have working links to its informational sources and maybe a different section on body positivity.
