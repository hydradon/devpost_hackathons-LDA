                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We played a similar game like surviv.io and PUBG.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game(multi-player feature planned) that allows players to collaborate and survive in a post-apacalyptic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Unity as the game engine. We made our own visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't really know Unity and C# before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final game is pretty close to a playable game. For example, characters can move and shoot enemies. Moreover now we know more about Unity we can fix bugs and add more features in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, C#, game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survival Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have only implemented some of the most basic features of our design so the rest will be our future priority. Also we will test multiplayer in the future.
