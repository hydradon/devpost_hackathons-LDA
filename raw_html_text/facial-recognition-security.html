                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the healthcare process more efficient and reduce time for redundant tasks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out Facial Recognition security device ensures the safety in a restricted healthcare area and makes granting access easier.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically an ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of a visitor on the door and calls a python script to verify the person's identity. This is then logged on bluemix via the Huzzah ESP8266 wifi chip and an email is sent with the decision to open the door or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting meaningful input out of the ultrasonic sensor and facial recognition device as it wouldn't recognize the person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to execute a fully running device, although we almost gave up half way through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deploy device on Watson IoT for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facial recognition security
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fine tune the software to eliminate delays and create an app to receive the data that is now sent through an email and open the door.
