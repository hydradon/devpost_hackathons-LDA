                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students at our school struggle to keep emotional composure when dealing with the stress of all their responsibilities. Sometimes they need an outlet to express their emotions to so that their pent-up tension is released. That's when we had the idea to build a bot that would people who are going through that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help.Me is a ChatBot that holds a conversation with you and can give emotional support when the user is feeling negative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing React for front-end, Firebase for user-authentication, and DialogueFlow to interpret user input, we were able to create a system that interprets user response and replies with a set of expressions made by us.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to find how to use an API to connect React to DialogueFlow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We're proud to have made something that tackles mental health struggles using our intended field of study, Computer Science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since most of us were freshmen and sophomores during the hackathon, we were new to most of the technologies used for this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for help.me: Emotional Assistance ChatBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve Help.Me by implementing more features to help users.
