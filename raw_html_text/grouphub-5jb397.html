                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted people to be able to make groups of new friends.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to connect with people who want to do the same activities as you such as studying or playing sports. We also wanted to utilize location services to connect you with people nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio. We also implemented a google sign in system using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because this was the first time using android studio and the first hackathon for several members of our team, we had to spend a lot of time setting up and getting android studio to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the layout of the app done. Furthermore, the workshop on Google Firebase was crucial because we were able to have a google sign in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of android studio but the most important was learning how Hackathons worked. HackIllinois was a great introduction to hackathons for members in our team and being exposed to one was extremely valuable to us.

                <h2>
                    What's next for GroupHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main logistics that we wanted to implement was using a person's location to find people nearby so that would be the next step we have.
