                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group is often motivated by all types of video games. So when we thought of a video game that could utilize 5g, we thought of a multiplayer game using websockets. One that we hadn't seen and would be really fun is Pong Battle Royale

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pong is a player vs player pong battle royale game. You can play a game of pong against a friend, a group of friends, or 99 strangers.
