                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are visiting a new city and after a night out, it's time to return to the hotel. You know you are nearby and your friend Google Maps tells you to walk along the fastest route, not the most comfortable route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Maps tells you the fastest route from A to B. PopMap tells you the most exciting and most comfortable route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire application is written in Python and utilizes several popular packages, Flask and geopy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty accessing the data we needed for our initial algorithm. Google Maps and their underlying mapping providers do not share block by block level data, which is helpful for routing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were times we thought of giving up because of the project's complexity, but we carried on. In the end everything falls into place and that feeling is just amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about web development with Python, clustering machine learning algorithms such as kmeans, and the Open Street Map dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PopMaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a better algorithm for the routing of waypoints and clusters to direct the user to their destination on an efficient, and well populated route. Ideally they will not feel alone and will reach their destination in a timely manner.
