                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After being accepted to several colleges as young adults, our team all had a lot of questions about the campuses we were admitted to. We all had unanswered questions about specific departments, courses, and college life. We wanted to tackle this problem by providing a similar peer mentoring platform such as dildo.io by MIT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect prospective students with current students in a variety of class levels and programs across college campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Bootstrap to create a static site with a SQL database. We added a Facebook Messenger API to make it easier for the user to connect with a mentor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into getting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulling the data from the server; it was a new challenge for all of us. We also attempted to to use AWS as an alternative platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our website up as our team's first hackathon!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to pull data from a database using PHP, Express.js, Flask, etc. We also were able to learn how to approach problems differently and exposing ourselves to new platforms, libraries and frameworks.
                </p>
