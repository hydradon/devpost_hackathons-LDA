                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing fighting games on campus, but lately, I haven't had a chance to play them at home.  This puts me at a big disadvantage in this competitive scene. So, in order to improve while not being near my console, I have created an app that helps with blocking react-able attacks from different characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calls a random scenario and lets the user react to certain moves that each opponent does, as a type of reaction test to see whether blocks or counters would be successful against an opponent in an actual match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Development Studio to lay the groundwork of the app, and then used java to create certain actions and prompts based on the buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that I ran into was trying to connect my app to Microsoft Azure and having the app display each animation successfully.
