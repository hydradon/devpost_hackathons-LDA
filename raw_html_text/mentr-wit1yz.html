                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marty: I am part of a couple online groups aimed to support women in computer science. Often, a member who is established in the tech industry will offer mentorship in exchange for someone looking over the design of their new website, or giving advice about a work situation. However, direct messaging isn't the most conducive platform to sustain these relationships.
Skye: My primary focus is reaching out and connecting to LGBT+ individuals, especially those who are still living with unsupportive families with little agency over themselves. I recall being in that position, and what helped me the most was having mentors to which I can look up&ndash;&ndash;not only for advice, but also reassurance that LGBT+ people can be successful and happy in their lives. Therefore, I wanted to create a platform that allows for a more covert form of community outreach under the guise of professional development.

                    This inspired mentr. On this app, users create a profile, list their current skills/topics they want to learn, and specify whether they're currently available to mentor, mentee, or both! The app suggests matches based on skills/interests and availability for weekly (or bi-weekly, monthly, etc) checkins. The user can also specify preferences for community groups (eg. LGBT, women, etc) so they can make connections within historically underrepresented groups in tech.

                <p>
                    We would like to add a news feed sort of feature, where users could post anonymously for quick help on technical questions, resume/cover letter help, etc. However, we would have close moderation to make sure that users are not being disrespectful; this is really important since marginalized groups are already discouraged from joining the tech industry.
