                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanted to do something for Hackagong. We've never done anything like this before, but the more we planned it, the more feasible it became, and the more we saw the potential usefulness of our drunken idea.
Now it's something we take seriously, and plan to build a real business out of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Locationiser is a device designed to scan a room from a single point, and gain precise measurements, to display in as 3D blueprints. The final device and application will be useful to engineers and architects working in existing spaces, and in many other situations.
It will also be capable of re-detecting its location, having moved within a mapped environment, to measure distances between delicate scientific apparatus that may require such precision, and will have a wide array of measurement calculation tools within the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Locationiser using an Arduino, breadboard, Servo Motor, and a LIDAR. We modelled the parts in Autodesk Maya, and printed them on a 3D printer, before assembling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D Printed models do not always come out to the precise measurements of the models printed. There is often overlap, and countering it requires a lot of trial and error.
Additionally, testing the product was impossible until we had completed the modelling and construction of the parts, meaning that the coding was blind,
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the parts together, and making this project a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That 30 hours is not enough, and prototyping is a lot of work!
                </p>

                    What's next for The Locationiser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finalisation of the project, before refinement of a commercial version.
