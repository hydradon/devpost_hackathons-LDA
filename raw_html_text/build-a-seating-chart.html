                    How we built it using c++. Can possibly use student behavioral reports for data.Our algorithm takes people with high GPAs and seats them next to people with okay GPAs so that they can have a positive influence on them. It also does not let disruptive students sit next to each other.

                    Challenges we ran into not being able to access the student behavioral report database.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of our program somewhat was able to implement our idea.

                <h2>
                    What we learned that coming up with a seating algorithm is tough and some factors are hard to consider such as which students are compatible with each other or if friends should sit together even though there is the possibility that they might distract each other.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Build A Seating Chart is to implement into a website with better graphics and we need to adjust our algorithm to accommodate more possibilities.
