                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After making the midi streamable (uner 5ms latency)  under chrome and playable in the browser with midi usb controller, i made a light portable device for live remix of midifiles from the SD of the Teensy micro-controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the hardware and the website can work together or separate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The hardware part
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Read midifile from the SD card, even the multi track midifile 
The portable device can also play 16 voice synthesizer and 8 tracks synthetic drums with build in Teensy DAC
AND / OR play the midi to external devices midi or usb midi 
It can also stream the midi to chrome and the the other user you will be able to connect with thru socket IO
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The  Website part
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website in a nice visual interface to manage all
the settings of the harware, liken enveloppe, FX, adsr 
and also for routing the midi 
The website can also be used for the visuals.
You will be able soon to buy midifile content or sell it thru a block-chain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First came the midifile SD reader srted from scratch.
Then it was nice to build the engine to enjoy the midifiles
So the we needed to make an interface fo the settings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    making the streaming working well from chrome, while replacing
midi from a controller to teensy by  controller to chrome to teensy, to chrome
The solution is to send it directly to  the stream if it is from controller 
but not if it is from teensy 
the possibilities are very multiple, so explanation are complicated 
We build a second harware synthesizer, nut finish to prove
the concept to stream midi from hardware to harware, fast
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The midifile SD reader is working well with many files
The machine harware have such a nice look
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    focuse on the main function first 
scheduling missions to all the team's members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peach Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MAking running the harware perfectly, mybe a kickstarter
and for sure, when ready, the code for SD midi teensy will be un github with few usage exemples
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to mix the website midistream.com with the harware stream concept and ad
a web platforme to buy and sell midifiles that you will create on our hardware
