                    1.1 Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The gaming industry is currently booming, especially on the crypto space. However, I saw how the industry demanded more scalability and accessibility for crypto games with Satoshis Games platform - a web-based platform to play bitcoin games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had such a huge demand for indie game developers to upload their lightning games to Satoshis Games platform. However, due to the architectural design of Satoshis Games, we had compatibility issues with games that were not web-based. Then we needed to find a potential solution to supply this high demand for a standard to unify all different crypto games with SDK tools for game developers. Wop! Wop! This looks similar to App Mining for dapps, right?
                </p>
                <h3>
                    1.2 Problem
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The current situation for distributing &amp; publishing crypto games is fragile chaos. There are only 2 options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Individual platform
                        </strong>
                        . Game developers have to research, design and develop their distributing platform with crypto utils tools as well as their game to maximise their game experience + extend the crypto functionalities. Making it extremely hard in terms of resources cost and interoperability issues
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Use existing no-crypto platforms
                        </strong>
                        . Game developers publish and distribute their games on unfriendly crypto platforms such as steam, uplay or discord. Game developers would not be able to distribute their games using bitcoin to process payments. When in-game assets are managed using crypto or other currency that is not the steam, uplay or discord balance the game is violating the terms and conditions. Thus, putting the game developers at risk because of the lack of an existing unified standard to distribute and publish blockchain games with SDKs, crypto accessibility utils tools and crypto-friendly
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    1.3 Solution
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Developing a gaming standard to develop, distribute bitcoin games, run crowdfunding campaigns, sell in-game contents in a marketplace and implement an SDK to integrate instant micro-transaction for games using the lightning network. The name of this platform is Elixir. Elixir will count with an API for processing payments in Bitcoin. This API will be targeted to game developers so that they could integrate lightning network payments in a non-intrusive way for users and game developers.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    1.4 Scope
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The gaming platform allows the submission, commercialization and download of games provided by the community. A game page is provided to host the game details such as screenshots, promotional videos, additional information and hardware requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crowdfunding campaigns and the community marketplace are delivered using BTCPay Server with an easy wrapper to allow no-custodial services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An API is provided to allow a digital authenticity module based on lightning (LAuth - based on digital signature and PoP) and payment processing module to link point of sales for the commercialization of games. Alternatively, an innovative module for calling smart contracts using an abstract lightning network interface connected to a WEB3 instance is provided to maximise the in-game assets management through the lightning.
                </p>

                    Background
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Carlos Roldan is the founder at Satoshis Games - company based on creating the next generation of gaming experiences on top of Lightning Network. Our customers were players of Satoshis Games platform, but a new system is being created and specified in this document so game developers and gamers could benefit from Elixir.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carlos Roldan has identified the problem of the absence of a bitcoin payment systems for games commercialization and publishing since Steam disabled bitcoin payments back in 2018. Therefore this is an opportunity to provide an easy and simple modular (custodial / no-custodial) for game developers and gamers. The system will consist of Elixir SDK for processing Lightning Network payments and Elixir Platform to overcome the current challenges of gaming platform where indie developer are not able to release high-quality games even when their unfinished games attract high attention and process bitcoin payments.
