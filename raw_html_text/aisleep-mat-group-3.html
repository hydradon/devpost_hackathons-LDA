                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to redefine the smart pillow by providing a pillow insert that could leverage the sleep data from the user to allow for useful sleep feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AiSleep Mat measures the temperature, sound level, movement, and duration that a person sleeps. This data is displayed on the website using Adafruit. In the full product concept, the data would then be used in an algorithm to provide the user with helpful tips to sleep better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The insert was built using accelerometers, force sensors, temperature sensors, a microphone, a yoga mat, a MKR 1000, an Arduino breadboard, and a battery pack. We used the Arduino software to code the various software features. Adafruit was used for graphical representations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into was the measuring of motion. This was fixed by using an accelerometer. Another challenge was hooking up the force sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of detecting when a person woke up during the night by looking at the movement chart. This was accurately proved when Rohan Patel woke up in the middle of the night and the Adafruit graphs recorded the movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sleep and the quality of sleep could be tracked in a few sensors. In addition, we learned that teens wanted a way to fix their sleep issues and our product fixed that issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AiSleep Mat - Group 3
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will expand into creating an algorithm that will give suggestions to the user. In addition, we will create an alarm clock feature that vibrates the user when they have to wake up and we will make a cooling feature to make sure that the sleeper is comfortable throughout the night.
