                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by existing UiPath activities.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In normal practice user will only be able file as an attachment in mail.If he wants to send folder then he has to zip it and send. So by using SendingFolderThroughMail snippet , user will be able to zip a folder and can send the same as an attachment through mail in a single shot.
