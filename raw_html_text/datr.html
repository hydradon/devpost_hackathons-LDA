                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current dating apps and websites allow individuals to decide who they would like to meet based on the purely the premise of physical appearances. While physical attraction is undeniably a component that's important, oftentimes, the approach of popular dating applications lead to awkward first meetings as individuals find it hard to connect. Our app solves this issue by redesigning the online dating process, ensuring that awkward initial meetings are avoided and that users of Datr walk into dates confidently with conversation ideas in mind.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    An individual using Datr would choose their interests from the drop down menu, and would proceed based on these interests. They would then be shown other individuals who share common interests and can filter out matches based on the side filters. They can then choose to send an invite to the individual and connect.
