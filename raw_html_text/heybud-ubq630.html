                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While thinking about how hard and tough school is, we thought about how much more difficult school would be for people with disabilities/impairments. School is already tough enough as it is, which is why we wanted to make it easier for them. We wanted to make it easier for students with impairments to learn, which is why we created HeyBuddy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To sum it up, it is a full package to help students with disabilities in the learning environment. Also, you do not need to have an impairment to use this, if you learn better via audio or text, you could use this to your own advantage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to split up the section into four different parts, so everyone had their own part to work on. This way, our team was a lot more efficient and we were able to add a lot more features to our web app.
Text to Speech (Visual Impairment): We used a Voice Synthesizer application.
Speech to Text (Audio Impairment): We used Google's Voice/Text API.
Physical Disabilities: We used Google Maps API
Contact Us: we used a live chat
Additional: we created a login system that saves user's information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to implement the Google API as there were many unexpected obstacles came up. However, through troubleshooting and going on online forums, we were eventually able to get over those obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to integrate all parts of our web application together through Google App Engine and incorporate basic logic into our HTML using jinja2
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate Google's very tricky APIs and Google Cloud SDK. We also became a lot more familiar with other parts of Web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HeyBud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to eventually switch this web application onto mobile platforms, such as iOS or Android. This way, our features will be a lot more accessible for students to use, as they won't have to bring their laptop everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we hope to not only integrate this into the educational environment, but we hope to integrate it into workplaces and many more. People with disabilities/impairments already face a lot of struggles in their lives, so we want to get rid of as many struggles as possible.
