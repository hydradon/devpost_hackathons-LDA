                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pet Finder has limited filtering to connect humans to their future furry family member. As such, we wanted to improve the ability to help match adoptable pets with their potential humans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shelter and rescue organizations rate their adoptable pets based upon a set of personality characteristics. Humans seeking a new family member take a quiz to gauge their compatibility to the pool of adoptable pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web application that incorporates several technologies from mySQL on the back end to PHP on the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member was a novice in the technology that we used. As such, we had limited knowledge in how to incorporate the technology we knew with the other technologies the team was using. This led to some compatibility issues as we were developing the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each individual in the team expanded their capabilities of the technology that they were using during this event. A working console application was built within the time frame. A complete mockup of the website was fleshed out to assist in the future direction of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were pushed to the limits of our understanding of the technology that we knew, we learned how to focus on what we could do in order to provide a demonstratable product at the end of this challenge. Along the way, we learned more about the challenges that face St. Louis community with respect to responsible pet ownership and the organizations that assist with helping pets to find forever homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wag Match
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to fully integrate all parts of everyone's contribution to one application. From talking with the behaviorists, there are avenues to consider to improve the matching algorithm and ensure more successful people-pet pairing. We want to expand this to other animals and not limit the matching to just dogs. Also, we want to develop a way to monitor the long-term success of human and pet bonding based upon behavioral/personality matches.
