                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members found it difficult to remember when to use her medications at some point. We did some research and asked some friends who are in the health field, including research students and medical school students and found that patient compliance rates were a huge issue when it came to healthcare. We found that a majority of patients in a multitude of studies conducted by reputable scientific journals have shown a vast majority of patients have cited forgetfulness as one of their reasons for non-compliance.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows users to take a picture of their prescription drug label, and using natural language processing, we parse the instructions for the drug, including the name of the drug. Then, using this information, we create calendar events to remind the patient to take their drugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, capture image and route it through an optical character api, then through natural language processing, we parse the instructions and the times needed to populate the Google Calendar to make repeated events.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had lots of difficulty trying to figure out how Android worked since it was most of our first times doing Android. Finding a proper NLP api was a challenge as well.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to tackle a huge problem in a very important area, all the while learning new technologies and having fun while doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making Android applications and NLP is a huge field.

                <p>
                    We hope to extend it to wearables, so patients can have their notifications with them wherever they go.
