                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program was inspired by the lack of contact applications for desktop users. We wanted to make a simple but effective contacts program for those many users that was simple to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program saves contacts and also allows for organization of contacts by first name, last name, address, and phone numbers. The program is simple and lightweight with little stress on any computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JFrame to build the UI, and java to build the backend systems such as the sorting algorithm and converting inputted text into a readable (.txt) format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, such as issues with sorting and having to learn JFrame from scratch (we did not know anything about user interfaces before the hackathon)! Also, we had some difficulty combining our individual pieces of code to assemble the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have learned JFrame from scratch, which is something that is useful far beyond the hackathon time. Also, we demonstrated resilience in the face of multiple setbacks and teamwork skills that helped us succeed. Our program isn't the most flashy, but is useful in the right conditions, and we felt that our program could be used in a much broader setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to work together in larger groups to program a modular code piece, instead of doing it individually. For example, one of our members worked on the user interface, while one worked on a sorting algorithm, while the other worked on converting the input into readable format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Contacts Portable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, it would be great to expand the functionality of Contacts Portable to include features such as emailing large amounts of people, and improving the look and function of the UI. Also, one thing that could be included in a program like Contacts Portable is a cloud service for backup.
