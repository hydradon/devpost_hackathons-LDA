                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We startedas a fork of the "Trust or Not" project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It basically allows Users to build a Reputation across various services where the user remains self sovereign. For instance hire an AirBNB and organize your own insurance using Blockchain and the people around you. The people around you will vouch for the agreement that you want to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's still a great idea.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Each provider has their own
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for BlockREP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reputation is now backed by the collateral of you acquaitances, but it could be extended by using your history and results of transactions. A Reputation explorer could also show this in a nice overview.
