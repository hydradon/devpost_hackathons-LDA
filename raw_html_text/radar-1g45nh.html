                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to a new campus is daunting. I always struggle to get to grips with new places. However, I love to explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app gives you the freedom to explore but at the same time find your way around and get to know your campus through geofences that tell you which building you are in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Radar SDK and android studio. With the help of public Github sample code, we were able to implement our own geofences in our campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Radar was problematic and it was a learning curve. This was our first attempt at using android studio to build an app and as well as this, it was our first Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of putting ourselves in a new environment and learning new skills under a time limit. The pressure helped us to push ourselves to learn more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using new SDKs, and using Android studio to make apps.

                    What's next for Radar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intersections between buildings to tell you where you are exactly. More precise and better notification systems.
