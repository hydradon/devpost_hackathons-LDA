                    After doing research for biology class, we have come to realize that the state of our enviornment is very poor and steadily deteriorating. As a team comprised of teens, mobile apps and smart phones are an integral part in our lives. Thus, we have a lot of knowledge in how to make apps user friendly and encourage people to use our app. We have modeled the format of our app after a nutrition tracker where everyday, food is logged. In our app, users are prompted to log resources such as water and electricity used in the day which is then used to calculate carbon footprint. After this is calculated, advice is given to help the user reduce their carbon footprint and help save the enviornment.
