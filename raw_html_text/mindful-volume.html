                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how loud we could get while playing video games and wanted a way to let us know before people complained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device mutes all sound from a device if the user is being too loud, thus letting them know. The volume will become unmuted once the volume decreases to an acceptable level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The setup was built using an Arduino to control the microphone and noise detection while a raspberry pi was used to simulate audio.
