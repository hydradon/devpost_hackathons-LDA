                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many food and clothing drives for people who cannot easily access or afford them, but there are hardly any feminine product drives in comparison.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bring donations from women who do not need their feminine products to women who do. People in local areas can donate feminine products as well as diapers, formulas, and more. Online contact can be initiated by app users, and the process is easy and straight to the point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby and Swift, along with a few app templates to make our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very inexperienced in creating an app. Creating the app took three hours worth of tutorials and an hour of searching through websites for information. The idea for our app took a long time to formulate, and it was made difficult because of our initial lack of knowledge on the background of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished our app with the time constraint with our idea which we are passionate with. Our project plan and the deliverance is something which can make a difference in the lives of women in the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something we learned was to not give up and to persevere. Although the process was slow and frustrating, our hard work produced wonderful results to our efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FemPals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on incorporating maps for people to find where the nearest center with donation bins are. Using trackers and directly linking the user to the path to the donation bins is something we will try to incorporate for the future.
