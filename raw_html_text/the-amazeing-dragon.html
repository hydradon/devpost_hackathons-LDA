                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make many very different projects, so we decided to combine our ideas into one game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is powered by the amazing Unity program.
You can use the keys "WASD" to move around, the mouse to look around, and use ctrl or left click to shoot a red cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transferring files between teammates.
Last minute technical difficulties have caused the temporary removal of a dragon. It took a while, and was completely modeled in blender.
Animating the dragon.
