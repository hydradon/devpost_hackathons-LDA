                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a program that would make users' days by sending them a gif based on the sentiment of the message they sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emogif allows users to send a message, which is analyzed for its sentiment level, and texts back a message with a gif url based on that score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio, Microsoft Text Analytics API, and GIPHY API in order to create our project. When Twilio receives a message, it sends it to the Microsoft Text Analytics API, which returns a sentiment level. Based on this sentiment level, the GIPHY API is called to return a random gif with a similar mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the package directory. It was not being found by default installers because of a previously installed program that altered the patching system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we were struggling to come up with a project idea, but in the end we were proud to be able to have completed this simple project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the group's members learned how to use APIs and Twilio. We were able to learn how to trouble shoot better and be persistent through the challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for emogif
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve the algorithm for matching a sentiment level to a gif.
