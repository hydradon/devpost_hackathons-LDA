                <p>
                    We ALL have that elderly relative who isn't the most tech-saavy (a.k.a. not at all), ESPECIALLY when it comes to complex mobile apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But does that mean they don't deserve access to today's life-changing tech?
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        NO!
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        ABSOLUTELY NOT!

                    Recently, we have seen massive development of health/fitness apps for young to middle-aged people like _ MyFitnessPal _ ! But
                    <strong>
                        nothing
                    </strong>
                    for our elderly community! They are the demographic most susceptible to health issues, and thus the most in need of accessible healthcare technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, there's something very wrong with this, and we wanted to address it!

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Accessing usable food/caloric data ~ we couldn't a proper API for food &amp; caloric data; thus, we created our own massive JSON file with 500 items!
