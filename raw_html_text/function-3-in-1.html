                    I got the inspiration when I was out hiking in Vancouver over winter break. I had to pack my sleeping bag into my bookbag and it took up a lot of room and really weighed me down. So, I thought, hey, wouldn't it be cool if there were some type of sleeping bag that turned into a bookbag for easier accessibility? After ideating, I realized it could be used for so much more than just hikers. Refugees, homeless people, victims of natural disasters, or people who are in hurricane prone areas could use a product like this. It's super warm and cozy and perfect for super cold harsh winters. Its an every day carry item that I hope to improve in the future. Some problems I came across while making this was, how am I going to get this to fit to the body and where are the arms going to come out of this thing? It took a minute to figure out that the way I was going to do that was being able to cinch that part in using a drawstring so the arms would raise and be a "flattering" fit.
