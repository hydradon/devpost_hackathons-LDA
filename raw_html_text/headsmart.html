                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us are bicyclists who enjoy to ride with the comfort of safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a bicycle helmet that saves lives. It prevents the cyclist from being distracted from the world around them. Our helmet provides a unique way to have the convenience of turn-by-turn navigation as well as a built-in safety procedure in the event of a collision. The helmet has turn-by-turn navigation that uses motors on the left and right of the helmet to allow the cyclist to know which direction is coming up without looking at their phone for maps' help or GPS. There are also turn-signals on the back of the helmet. There is also a collision-detection system in place that uses an accelerometer to detect sudden, violent changes in motion--differing from the regular movement of looking around the environment--to show a crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino on the helmet that managed all the signals, haptic feedback and collision detection system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many issues with trying to communicate between an App to an Arduino wirelessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to provide a working prototype before the submission deadline!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to maximize efficiency in an algorithm which will help on processing times and the time it takes to send and receive information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HeadSmart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to fully implement the GPS features on the helmet to provide a location to the emergency contact and be able to fit the sensors in a much tighter package that would allow for mass production.
