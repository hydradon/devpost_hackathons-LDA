                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coming here and seeing all the brilliant designs there was a gaping whole on the field of emotional intelligence. It is incredibly hard for a robot to be able to understand what a human is feeling. That is nowhere scanning you comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It discovers if a person is happy or sad by taking a picture of someone and analyzing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built out using a website that accessed the video camera which would then send a picture as a blob to a database where it would then be accessed by Wolfram's API to analyze whether it is happy or sad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I tried Mongo as my database of choice but after 30 minutes of not doing any progress, I eventually tried three other databases before landing on Heroku. Also, for a majority of Saturday Wolfram's website was incredibly slow and was not working so I had to download the entire 7gb software to my computer to use Wolfram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The linking of all of the databases to my actual website and getting the computer to find out what emotion is being felt a majority of the time if not all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about HTML and java script, I also learned how to make an AWS that could help me send files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scanning You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I hope to be able to make Scanning You into an easily accessible website that anyone can go to and can find out what emotion they are feeling from a larger choice of emotions.
