                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting the bills in a restaurant after a meal is time consuming; footing the bill for office supplies or for a group project is a hassle to ensure that everyone pays back. We want to tackle the problem of splitting the bills that we run into every weekend, sometimes everyday, through a SlackBot by settling the payments automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PayTogether is a bot that helps splitting the bills fast and simple. It starts with just a snap of the receipt and uploading it on to slack. PayTogether then reads the total amount on the receipt and split it among the number of members in the group chat-So. Easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PayTogether is built using Node.js and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 3 backends relating to the architecture of this bot:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1. SlackBot
                    </strong>
                    User will upload image onto Slack and Slack sends the image to Microsoft Azure for processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2. Microsoft Azure
                    </strong>
                    After processing and parsing the receipt image, it then sends the information to standard library for an API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        3. STL API
                    </strong>
                    Standard library returns a JSON file for the slackbot to process and operate on.
                </p>

                    What's next for PayTogether
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will look at developing more complex ways to split the bills such as individuals choosing their own food to split, having two bills combined, etc. We will also want to move on from Slack and expand this service to other messenging platforms such as Facebook messenger bot.
