                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see how we would be able to incorporate traveling with mini-games to help people who are about to travel for the first time so we can educate them on how to pack and travel smart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website takes the user to a mini-game that teaches them through the game what items they can bring to the airport and what items they can not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, JavaScript &amp; CSS to design this game &amp; interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not get the actual names of the items to appear on the screen &amp; the snake could not eat the "gree" items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a beautiful gradient background &amp; got the snake game to work in essence &amp; end once the snake hit a "red" block!
