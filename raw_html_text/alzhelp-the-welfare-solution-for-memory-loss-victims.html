                    The Backstory
                </h1>
                <p>
                    My late grandfather, was a patient with alzheimer's, and had a bit of leaving the house unannounced, without his helper, many a times he would try to wander out of our building. On one specific day, he slipped past the watchman, and we couldn't find him for a whole day. After vain efforts to find him, we received a whatsapp message regarding a lost person, found near Malad(which is pretty far from my residence at Andheri), thankfully, it was my grandfather. We were relieved but always extremely cautious in future. After this, on mutiple occasions I have seen such messages for either missing persons or such persons being found. Thus, originated the idea of AlzHelp. I was further pushed to do this when I learned that a major public figure like KS Sudershan of the RSS suffered from the same disease and went through a similar experience, however he having no close relatives and unmarried had to go through alot of hardships. All of this together proved to be the catayst for my idea, and pushed my brain further to come up with this project.

                    The App
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Anybody whose family members or loved ones suffer from any kind of memory loss diseases, can download the app and enter the details of the patient, like ICE contact numbers, address, emergency protocols for any sudden abnormal or violent behaviour shown by the patients, the doctor incharge, etc. Whenever such a patient is found, instead of going through such hassles of finding his family, taking him to the police station or the hospital,
or feeling guilty for not helping, it all goes away. The person can simply open the webpage and cllick a photograph of the patient. The program will through face recognition, location filtering, and some other algorithms, find the details of the patient and share it with the person. Its THAT simple, and hassel-free too. It's the most efficient way to help people. In cases where the family already knows the patient is missing, they can press the SOS Button on the app, such entries will be checked first when searching for the patients details, to fasten the process. We will also have a list of location based nearest emergency center available on the webpage. To avoid fake patients, prankers, etc we will have an option to upload a doctor's certificate, whose authenticity we will be checking through artificial inteligence, to avoid degrading the standards and pollution of the app's database

                <p>
                    To further help these patients AlzHelp, which as it grows in the coming years, gains recognition, we realize we will have a database of patients of some mental disease affected patients. We can share the data, keeping in mind security and privacy norms, with medical organizations which might be needed for drug trials, some motivating thoughts and speeches, guidelines for the family of such people, or even apps like NetMeds or 1Mg which might get them medicines and substancialy lower rates. This will also create a revenue source for AlzHelp, which we can reuse in app betterment, or for furtherment of interests of the Company.
