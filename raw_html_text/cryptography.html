                    How it works: THe Hill Cipher method is utilized to encrypt a phrase the user provides. The program utilizes math concepts such as matrix multiplication in order to encrypt the phrase with a randomly generated key. Once the phrase is encrypted, a file is generated and stored to a user-specified location. The same program has a decryption mode to decrypt the generated file
