                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this site as part of Hack Davis 2018, a hackathon for social good. By organizing different causes of death and health information in each state, we hope people will take a more active interest in their health. From our baseline data we want to provide people with more resources and try to make health information more accessible. Our goal is to help facilitate a conversation surrounding health in the US.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web Services to host the website, specifically their S3 and Route 53.

                    Additional applications for this data could involve giving people more specific statistics based on their age, sex assigned at birth, and ethnicity, however, we could not find this data at the national level.
