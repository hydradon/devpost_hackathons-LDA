                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the theme of Statefarm, we embarked on a journey to quote generation process not as tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scan and Wham scans a driver's license, parses it for usable information and generates a quote for an insurance. The generated quote as a feature of being controlled by hand gestures picked up by a webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scan and Wham is built primarily using Javascript. The plugins used are Dynamsoft, JSPDF, and Jshg.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally back-end developers, it was a challenge for us to develop a static website that includes all the functionalities that Scan and Wham possesses without any server-side scripting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having made a prototype of the idea that we came up with in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building Scan and Wham, we got acquainted with some amazing and new Plugins powered by Deep Learning techniques. We surely intend to use these plugins for our future projects.

                    What's next for Scan and Wham
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scan and Wham needs to be properly seeded.
