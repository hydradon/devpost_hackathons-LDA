                    Lunch Buddy is an app that allows diners to reserve seats as well as pre-order their meal at canteens and food courts. A certain number of seats in a food court would be reserved for Lunch Buddy users. These seats will be intelligently allocated to the users by the time slots and number of seats indicated. Stall owners can view the orders created and prepare it just-in-time for collection. users do not have to spend their mealtime searching for a seat and queueing for food. This allows the space at the eateries to be maximised people will naturally spread their lunch times over a longer period collectively. The net result will be an improvement in the quality of life of customers and will also draw more customers to food courts as people are able to plan their time better.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the user interface using Android Studio. This consists of a series of simple forms for the user to fill up. The information is then sent to a database created in Firebase which is then relayed to the stall owners preparing the food and the canteen operators enforcing the reservations.
