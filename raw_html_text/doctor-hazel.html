                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peter and Mike have been passionate about bringing down the cost of healthcare in United States and the World.  New developments in hardware and software allow us to give patients a free AI based screening to help catch skin cancer before it becomes fatal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a high resolution camera connected to Movidius Neural Computer Stick we can detect the likelihood that it looks like cancer in real time.  This gives people quick and easy feedback on whether or they should book an appointment with a dermatologist and do a biopsy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's build with Python, Caffe, high powered Intel AI hardware and general web technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting training data in Healthcare is really challenging.  There are no datasets available and
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to train the engine to 85% accuracy.  This is great for just a few hours that we were able to do this at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are great promise in the Health Care industry if the data is available and doctors are allowed to use novel solutions.  We are looking forward to being able to being Doctor Hazel to the masses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doctor Hazel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first priority is getting more data and training the engine.
We hope that in the next several months we can train the engine to get closer to 100% accuracy.
In 2018 we hope to get some beachhead customers who will help us fine tune the flow.  Those customers could be doctors who don't specialize in dermatology, kiosks at drug stores and even in the field.
