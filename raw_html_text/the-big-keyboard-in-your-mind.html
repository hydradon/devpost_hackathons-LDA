                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my other projects with MPU modules.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to type anywhere on a virtual keyboard.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build in in Arduino C.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Unchangeable I2C Buses
Unmodifiable Firmware
Massive Data Range and error

                    The concept.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always bring your own modules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The BIG Keyboard in Your Mind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transition away from Arduino to C and migrating to the use of a PIC or ARM microcontrollers, as well as the integration of accurate MPU module which will allow me to make the full keyboard as well as measures more aspects of the motion.  This will also bring down the size.
