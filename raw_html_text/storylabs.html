                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We incorporated Kin SDK in Android as well as in our python back-end on AWS. We took the design inspiration from various story writing platforms. User sign-up is made simple with Facebook Login kit.

                    As we started late, we didn't get much time to build more features. Plus, initially there were hiccups with Kin SDK integration, but with the help of Kin community we were able to sort things out very quickly.
