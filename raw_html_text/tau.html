                <p>
                    Crystal and Maryann are seniors at Stuyvesant High School dedicated towards improving the public education system by supplementing standard teaching practices with education technology based on engaging students through a familiar and increasingly convenient medium.
As students attending a school at the center of a controversial debate on the merits of a test-based admissions versus holistic admissions process, both Crystal and Maryann feel they are responsible for working towards creating a more diverse and equal student body. Crystal's own experiences with working with minority middle school students has revealed the inadequate education that many public school students must endure, which can devastate any chances at upward socioeconomic movement. She has noticed a persistent trend in mathematics that indicates most students are held back due to lack of knowledge in math, not lack of intelligence.
Both Crystal and Maryann hope that by bringing education into the modern age by incorporating technology, they can not only make it easier for students to become interested in the material but also make it easier for teachers to take advantage of the incredible optimization, automation, and speed of modern computers.

                    Our project generates random, but not too difficult problems for 3 math topics: Algebra, precalc, and calculus.  Algebra problems consist of expansion and factoring, precalc questions consist of conic sections, and calculus questions consist of finding derivatives and integrals. The user can input their answers and will get told if they were correct and will be told the correct answer.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tau is built with Flask as the framework.  We use python to generate all of the numbers for the problems and to check the user response.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly a lot of our challenges came from the front end.  In addition, some of the math was difficult to do with the basic python that we used.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about python and getting information between web pages!

                <p>
                    We hope to expand to have more types of problems available.
