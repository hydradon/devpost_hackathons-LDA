                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I are seniors at VCU Arts, as well has team members at a nonprofit tech start up with the mission to hack the foster care system. With Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board, it was born of these two loves in our life, where the key topic we were focused on tackling was communion and collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As artist its very easy to become isolated and focused on your specific body of work, however we found that some of the most successful piece of art come from artistic collaboration. A similar problem can be found in the Foster care system, where visualizing your goals with a supporters and/or other youth isn't a common or accessible practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That why my team and I created Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board, which is a device for collaboration between people to in real time to illustrate as a team goals, ideas, and strategies for life or for fun. .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board is a platform that allows for duel collaboration between peers. The digital space here encourages a new form of communication, as visual communication is a basic and instinctual langue by all people. With the wide range of pens, brush sizes, colors, and shape options, its the perfect space to work with someone from washing out an artist idea, visualizing a personal goal, or just planing a shopping list with a friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what ever amazing idea or piece of art that is ultimately collaboratively created can be saved as a png to you desk top for the owner to have documentation of the collaboration work and cherish it forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board was built with Node.JS, Express, HTML5, and CSS3, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The collaboration digitally space was built with amazon web servers, share js, and node js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    something on servers here? with not being able to use semiphone and cake not working 
We ran out of time with adding an upload images and adding a text typing feature
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within 24hours we transitioned from cake to amazon web servers, this adjustment was crazy. We were so hyped with accomplishing this along with successfully using node.js, share.js, and fabric.js. Also getting the pen tool to work with ease features and saved image functions made us happy too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    wow, a lot.
We learned so so so much about servers, and within 24hours going from cake to amazon web servers, the transition was crazy, just we were so hyped with accomplishing this along with successfully using node.js, share.js, and fabric.js.

                    What's next for Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding the features within the overall platform. Things like uploading images, gifs, videos. We would also live to expand the collaboration from two people to also having an ai being involved with suggestions and assisting with the expansion of the over all Compan-Oekaki- Colaborative Vision Board. But also seeing the wide range of how this collaborative vision board can be used, from Artists to the Foster care system, to people like me who can't communicate at all and is always drawing out what I need with others for them to understand me.
