                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining our original idea of turning a surface into a touch screen with our group's love of music, we decided to pack the power of a DJ controller into the form factor of a Leap Motion. The end result is slimmed down controller that runs in the browser, and can be used anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We harnessed the power of the Leap Motion to project our custom controller interface into the air or onto any surface, allowing the user to scratch, fade, and mix to their hearts content -- all with hardware the size of a pack of gum.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to employing vector calculus and matrix algebra to transform raw position data from the leap motion into usable gestures, we built a low-latency audio engine from scratch on top of the web audio API to power our interface in real time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a refined interface and powerful set of intuitive interactions on top of a solid software core, while using few external libraries and dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated real-time data processing and output in our application, as well as low level audio manipulation and a custom canvas interface, all of which were new concepts to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interface refinement, additional features found in more complex controllers.
