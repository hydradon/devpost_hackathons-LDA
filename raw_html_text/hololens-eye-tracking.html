                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HoloLens is really cool, but the limited field of view provides challenges for the gaze based system.  Eye tracking would allow users to select things without shifting their entire head.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks the users eyes and reports the result back to the display
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, a raspberry pi, a pi camera, a fork and some electrical tape to mount it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the HoloLens emulator and development suite was very challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcoming early challenges and bringing together hardware and software
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to use new technology that doesn't have a lot of documentation and resources
                </p>
