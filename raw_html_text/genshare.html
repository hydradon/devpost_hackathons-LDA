                    Inspiration as
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing the high statistic of loneliness in seniors helped shape our decision of creating this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a concept of a website where seniors can organize events where they can teach younger people their skills and experiences. In doing so, we hope to help reduce loneliness in seniors by giving them a social platform to connect with people and pass on skills to the younger generation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that occurred are that html/css are too basic and we needed to learn a much better web development language such as php. But the biggest challenge we faced was turning this concept into a live fully functional website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn html and css under a short amount of time. Given the short time limit and beginner knowledge, we were able to achieve the goal we set at the beginning of hackathon and follow through with working html files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code a website within 24 hours. We also learned that we should come better prepared with ideas and concepts before going into a coding environment. We learned to identify our strengths and weaknesses, and we learned to focus on what we do best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GenShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the website itself is far from ready for online publishing. We hope to see how seniors would respond to this kind of idea, and also see the interest of younger people to learn new skills and help reduce loneliness in seniors as the website approaches completion.
