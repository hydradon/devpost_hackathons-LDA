                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interactive part of the app was challenging.
My group members gave up after 5 hours of working, and as a stats major, I decided to implement my own project with my favorite programming language and start this project from scratch.

                    I have come up with a clean and not bad project in my first hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learn how to create and deploy an interactive web app

                    What's next for Hack NBA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more visualization such as interactive plots and animations.
I did not have time to complete the radar chart and solve some formatting issues.
