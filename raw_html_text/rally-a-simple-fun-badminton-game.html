                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The small simple games in Facebook messenger. They're easy, fun, and addictive, so why not expand on that idea and make this for more sports?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You angle your wrist to control the angle of the racket. The birdie will hit the racket, and the angle of the racket determines the trajectory of the birdie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used actionScript and Adobe Flash CC to make the game. I used a few different equations for the trajectory, which were incredibly challenging. As the angle of the racket deviates from the angle that I want, the vertex of the parabola changes and causes the birdie to either go closer or go farther
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trajectories. I don't know the math behind them, and I still don't!! Additionally, I encountered a few unknown errors and bugs that prohibited me from improving the functionality of the game and accuracy of the trajectories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the math and logic that was used for this game, as well as the fact that I used a few new hardware features on the phone for input (e.g. accelerometer). These are very cool to use, and I look forward to using these sensors to gain access to new data in the near future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to never underestimate a project. I came to this hackathon thinking about doing a relatively small project so we could just learn more rather than focus on competing. However, this ended up taking hours and hours of time - playing with parabolas, angles, hitPoints, hitBoxes, and so much more took absolutely forever.

                    What's next for Rally: A Simple, Fun badminton Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvements to the functionality, the aesthetics, and the accuracy. I would like to add support for game centre or other social media outlets to make it easy to share high scores and compete with friends. I would also like to fix the trajectories somehow, as some angles are highly inaccurate
