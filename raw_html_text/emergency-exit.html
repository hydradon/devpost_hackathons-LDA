                    It is a simple but fun game that we got the idea from the topics that were chosen by the organizer of the event  Puebla 2016. Is very easy to use and also very self explanatory, it teaches some of the most simple rules of what you have to do during a natural disaster or some other type of emergency.
We built it in a platform that is called construct2 which is useful because we can export the project to diverse terminal devices.

                <p>
                    When developing this project we ran in conflict with the platform that we wanted to use because not every person of the team knew how to use construct2, finally we ended up using it and dividing the task between the members of the group.  Even thought we didn't finished all the levels that we thought we would it was an amazing experience and we are proud of the level we did. We learned how to work in team and divide the tasks in order to end the project the fastest way possible
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan on finishing this game or at least do another level of it, hopefully someday we'll improve it or do another one but better.
