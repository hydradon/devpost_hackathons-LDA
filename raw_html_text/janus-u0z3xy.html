                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from our social world. In this age of technology, it is so easy for one to share their thoughts and ideas with the world, but with all these different thoughts flooding social media constantly and at an exponential rate, it can be hard to gauge a general consensus about a person, place or thing. We wanted to allow people to be able to glean a sense of the sentiment in the world towards themselves and towards others as a whole.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user will enter our site, and type in whatever search term they want. The application then searches for tweets containing that search term and classifies those tweets in terms of how positive/negative the comments are in general.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we got the team together, which involved talking to different people and establishing each other's strengths  such as who preferred backend and who preferred frontend work. Once we got the team together we dived right into brainstorming. We narrowed our thought process down to about three ideas, however, the idea of what is now Janus really interested everyone, and also seemed the most feasible to be able to do in the time allotted. Next, was the project specialization. We decided the best course of action would be to have one person working on the frontend and two people working on the backend, and thus the coding began.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge we faced mostly stemmed from figuring out how to interact with 8base, which is something that we didn't have experience with at first.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to push ourselves further than we thought we could. We are also proud of how we were able to come together as complete strangers to be able to work so efficiently towards a common goal.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new skills and new libraries to work with.

                    What's next for Janus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to expand our search from Twitter to other sites such as Facebook to obtain a better and wider representation of sentiment towards a certain topic.
