                    We made shogi, a japanese game similar to chess but with more complex rules. 
These include being able to use captured pieces and almost all pieces have promoted classes when the reach 
the opponent's board.

                <p>
                    We used javascript and html to create the game. We also used heroku and a .tech domain (reallybadshogi.tech) to host the game. We wanted to emphasize the aspect of strategy in shogi, since there's always a way to win regardless of what situation you're in. Called the General's Game, shogi represents a war between two nations and the massive strategy that it necessitates.
