                    This project uses MPI and libCEED to solve simple PDEs on a cubic domain. The code uses conjugate gradient without a preconditioner. There are some bugs in the solver, but it outputs the results from every solver iteration.

                    Eventually this project will be linked to Python plots to do a live visualization of the contribution from each node. The goal is to facilitate understanding of domain decomposition and finite elements in HPC.

                    The code runs on a home-built Pine64 cluster networked to act like a supercomputer.

                    I've also included my included my 'pretending to work and look impressive' screensaver as a bonus!
