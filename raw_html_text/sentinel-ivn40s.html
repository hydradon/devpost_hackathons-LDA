                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were driven by the desire to gather and analyze data on users based on public information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program gathers users data from twitter and rates the sentiment of the tweet using googles natural language api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using Django, google natural language api, and python twitter api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lack of experience with django and google's api. Domain hosting issues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the twitter sentiment analysis works very well, even with the initial issues, we are glad to have gotten the system working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were introduced to google's api and django and getting them to work together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sentinel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on continuing to work on expanding the system to group individuals based on likes and dislikes
                </p>
