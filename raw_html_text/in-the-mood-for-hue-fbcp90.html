                    We want to provide mood lighting that's actually based on your mood! Inspired by Zack's desire to walk into his room and have lighting change depending on the expression on his face, this proof of concept prototype will use webcam image to flash LEDs inspiring you and others around you to to listen your feelings! Been staring at your code too long and feeling kind of down? The blue LED will remind you that maybe it's time to look at some cute baby otter pictures!
