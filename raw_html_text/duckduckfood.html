                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to deliver an easy way to explore the foodie within you.
Honestly, I fight with my girlfriend all the time on where to go and what to eat. This app is supposed to solve this issue by deciding where we are going to eat and we can not change where we eat after the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DuckDuckFood searches for restaurants near you and displays it in a familiar and easy to read format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using react-native
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since, none of us have used react-native before we all had to learn the language while creating the project at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of just being able to get a functioning app working during the hackathon. None of us had any expectation to get an app up and running but through our teamwork we were able to persevere through this hardship and create an amazing app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned react-native and front end development is a little harder than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DuckDuckFood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to implement an algorithm that displays the most "likeable" restaurant to the user. Meaning that based on the swipes and preference of the user the application will display the highest rating via the algorithm to the user.
