                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always being passionate about all kinds of technology and we love when we can inspire that passion on others, that's why we deemed suitable to create a tool to reassure this love for developing technology. And what better way to do it than using such an innovative technology as Virtual Reality to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a circuit creator using a Virtual Reality and interactions for students and enthusiasts to learn how to build basic activities in a didactic and fun way. Also, you are able to see the circuit better as it is presented in an oversized manner.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTC VIVE technology from Valve Inc. through a plugin to implement it in an Unity3D environment (SteamVR). For the Unity development we used C# Scripting and the aforementioned plugin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Until this mere day we haven't had even used a VR Headset before, so learning how to develop with it was a major challenge. Getting the right VR Headset as Oculus Rift hadn't the proper support, we opted for the HTC VIVE instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build 3D worlds and objects that I can interact with using the VR Headset and the Vive controllers; it's an experience we are glad to have had the opportunity to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Advanced Unity Scripting in C#, importance of networking, VR development using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 31: Circuit Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully operating proto-board that responds to interactions as closely as the "real deal". Implementing a system where you can save the circuits you've made and share it with others, as well as downloading and playing around with circuits made by others. And finally, to use it as a tool for spreading the fun and fulfilling building something from scratch can be.
