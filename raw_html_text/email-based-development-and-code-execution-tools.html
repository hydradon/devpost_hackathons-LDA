                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for coming up with
                    <strong>
                        Compilx
                    </strong>
                    was to give students easy access to coding tools on their phones and school provided tablets, which could not normal be used for coding purposes. As a teacher's assistant for my AP Computer Science A class, I wanted to help the students I thought as much as possible. The school provided each student with iPads they could not use to practice coding outside of class. However, these iPads did not have the ability to run coding tools, which was made me develop my first implementation of a cloud-based programming platform, my
                    <em>
                        predecessor
                    </em>
                    to Compilx.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It enables multi-class compilation and collaborative code share environment. Code is easy to share among students with a powerful feature developed during this hackathon, code collaboration through email. This enables students to discuss code with their peers and teachers, enabling them to learn more faster even outside the classroom environment. Students are not required to own a computer just to learn computer science thanks to this tool.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized Java EE, Asynchronous calls, JQuery, and Bootstrap for the main development environment. The email integration is powered through a combination of the main build environment and the MixMax Node-based development tools for Gmail integration.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SSL Authentication and Cross-Domain policy issues came up when attempting to integrate Compilx into MixMax.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an extensive email integration tool for programming.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    Learning how to use XMLHTTPRequest to get past Cross-Domain policy issues.

                    What's next for Compilx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more languages and releasing the next phase if it that has support for larger programming build systems.
