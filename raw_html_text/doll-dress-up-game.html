                <h2>
                    The Origin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea what to do and didn't know anyone. At first I tried asking around but it seemed people were content on their own/in their own groups, so I asked my friends online what I should do solo and they suggested that since I was good at art that I try to make my own doll dress up game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put you put different clothes on a body and you can randomize them if you don't want to do it yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I Did It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I made the basic layout using the Border Pane and the desired combo boxes &amp; buttons, then I set up the combo boxes to read the image files found in designated folders. The hard part, however, was having these folders change and also the actual loading of the Images from the folders into the Image Views. I'm not entirely sure why I had a lot of trouble with it, but I did. Then I set up the name generator and randomizer. Finally I drew all the images I was going to use then stuck them in the designated folders!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I had met my initial goal I tried to see if I could get color picking to work, I started with having the ability to change the skin tone, and it worked! Users can now choose their own skin tones.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Issues I Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a skirt at one point, but the skirt mixed with the coats caused an issue where the coat tried to fill in the area between the legs. I didn't have time to draw double the number of coats to deal with this so I removed the skirt :(. Also the ordering of the shoes and pants image views had to be changed as the boots were too thin for the pants and I had no time to redraw!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I'm Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It actually works and looks alright all the images are loaded dynamically so I can easily add more and take away some without worrying about it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I Struggled With
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changing the entire image libraries when switching between bodies actually took me quite a bit of time. Putting the project onto GitHub also took me a long time since I didn't know how to use it. I also had to find out how to change the skin color, I accomplished this by using a colorpicker and adding an effect to the image view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I'd Do Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more choices for the body type, mostly positions. Also add more clothes options. Nicer GUI would also be nice but I've grown attached to the simplicity it currently has.
                </p>
