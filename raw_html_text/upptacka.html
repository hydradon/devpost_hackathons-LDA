                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I now study French and Swedish, and one of the best methods of learning a language is supposedly immersion. The issue with this is that it can be very, very difficult to find media content in the language that you are trying to learn. Thus, Uppt&auml;cka was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uppt&auml;cka alleviates this process of finding content in your target language by doing it for you. You'll tell Uppt&auml;cka what you want to do and in what language you want to do it. You will then be redirected to a page that matches the parameters you asked for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uppt&auml;cka was built using mostly JavaScript, along with some Go and design magic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the reason for the creation of this tool was the difficulty of finding content in the first place, it created a bit of a paradox for us. Finding content to give to Uppt&auml;cka was definitely the most difficult part of writing the tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in Go, and more than a few new foreign words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Uppt&auml;cka
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to expand Uppt&auml;cka to many, many other languages. Hopefully, in the future, the tool could become autonomous, finding and providing content on its own.
                </p>
