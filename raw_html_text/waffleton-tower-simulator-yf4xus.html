                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by two completely separate people who will not be named that each on their own accord activated the fire alarm of Appleton Tower in exactly the same way - by burning a waffle in a microwave. This resulted in the microwave being removed from AT. Losing it was a very emotional experience which inspired us to create this tribute game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game. You can play it. You can toss a waffle to implicate another player for your grave sin of burning down the tower. You also need to evacuate by going down to floor -1.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By skimming a great bunch of tutorials and taping everything together until it works. We all have very little experience with C# and even less with Unity, so we would deem this project a moderate success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting stuck on seemingly simple mechanics and a lot of bugtesting. Lots of iterations in gameplay until we arrived at something that seemed fun and also doable by our skill level.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How entities interact in Unity, the hugely useful Tile Management tool, vectors, forces, velocities (the physics part was a doozie). And most importantly, prioritizing the most important features.

                <p>
                    FIXING ALL THE BUGS. Which would pretty much make it perfect.
