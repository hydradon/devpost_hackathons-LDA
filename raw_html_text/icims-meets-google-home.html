                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a practical and relevant project, we wanted to use the api, one of the mentors helped us realize to think simply and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companies that contract iCIMS for their job postings can use Google Home to monitor how many applicants fit certain criteria(i.e., location, degree, minimum experience).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using dialogflow to act as a middle man between the google home mini and machine functions, basically, the job posting employer can post their jobs through our website then monitor how many applicants fit the criteria that was inputted into the HTML website.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Connecting the HTTP to python which had to connect to the HTML code
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we finished the python code, html code, and the http section, however we still need to combine all three portions of our project.
## What we learned
How to use postman, better understanding of languages.
## What's next for iCIMS meets...Google Home!
Finish the project!
