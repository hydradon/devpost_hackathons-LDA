                <p>
                    A social network for users to search or make reviews about products.  But that's not all.  Users can keep updating periodically to show legitimate real-time and long-term results by reviewing products.  Instead of reading blocks of texts, you can scroll through people's experiences with a product.  Our app makes it easy for people to choose whether to try or buy a product.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on Android Studio.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting teammates was a challenge, but luckily we were able to find a great back-end developer.  More technically, we had trouble parsing JSON strings as well as inflating CardViews on the app.

                <p>
                    We are proud of how the GUI turned out and that we're able to submit this prototype today by going over hurdles we didn't expect.
