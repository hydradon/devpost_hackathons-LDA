                    Inspiration- Our inspiration was an interpretation of National Treasure 2. We were also beginners and we wanted to create a fun and unique game that was more complex than Tic Tac Toe.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- Our game takes you on a short treasure adventure through South Dakota as a bear. The Great Bear Adventure consists of many pathways to choose in order to ultimately try and collect the ancient treasure, honey. It is based of the famous game Zork.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- Using Python code, we collaboratively created our game with if statements, loops, and one function. Our game was also created with the informative help by the mentors at the code camp.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- 2/3 of our group had never coded before. Two of us are Juniors in high school and the third member has only dabbled with limited languages.  No one in our group knew the language of Python, so we all had to rely our mentors and the sessions going on to learn it. Errors would occur like inputs wouldn't function and story lines would not work or skip over.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- Our game did everything we wanted to do that we could manage, code, and think of for beginners. We were able to have the game start over if your character died, and we did this with a function, and the function made our game more intermediate. We also were able to put options within options. We figured out how to loop, break, and start over.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- We all learned a new language!! We understand now the different code words and functions such as; while, break, return, if, else, input... etc.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Great Bear Adventure- We would like to add visuals; we did not have enough time to learn and make visuals, but think that they would add more to the game. Additionally, sound effects would be cool. Our story line also would need some revising, so it flows and is user friendly. Ultimately, our game would become more visually pleasing and user friendly if rewritten in PyGame.
