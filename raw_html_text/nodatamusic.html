                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build NoDataMusic because we hated wasting a lot of data while listening to music
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our app, we have a phone number that you text with the name of the song. Then our app calls you back and plays the song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using NodeJS and Express, as well as the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into maannyyyy challenges. The first one was file size. We originally had it so it would text you with the song file and you could download it, but the song had to be under 4 minutes to get under the cap for T-Mobile messages. This meant that a large amount of songs were left unsupported. Next, we couldn't even send the file on some phones. The carrier simply took it out of the message, and then delivered it. This is the point we decided to change to a calling app. The final big problem we faced was MIME type. Our music files were showing .mp3 but they had an MIME type that was unsupported by Twilio. We ended up using ffmpeg to convert our mp3s.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of learning how to use the Twilio API very quickly, and it was Ronit's first experience in building an API that services or users could ping in order to do something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the technicalities behind messaging, structuring of APIs, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoDataMusic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that this app could be very useful because a majority of people do not have unlimited data. We could charge a monthly price that would ultimately be cheaper because services like Spotify use a large amount of data, and without the monthly subscription the ads take even more data.
