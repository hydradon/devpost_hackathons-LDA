                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found webgazer.js and really wanted to try out eye-tracking systems. We ended up creating a brand new accessible eye tracking web browsing feature that did not exist without pre-installing software to one's computer. Our domain name is realeyesrealizereallies.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the perfect tool as a web application that can be accessed by anyone. It assists those who are physically confined or paralyzed. Those who cannot effectively communicate through body language or verbal language are greatly assisted with this application. By using eye tracking as provided by the open source webgazer.js file, we were able to remap the data feed to control ones cursor to interact with the website. The website will allow the user to communicate their needs and feelings to people nearby as it can be linked directly to a nurse or medical personnel's contact information (i.e. computer, phone, or pager) as well as contact people outside of the hospital such as friends and family through an SMS server. For example, if after a car crash one was confined to the bed and could not talk with ease, they can easily use their eyes to select predefined options such as "Request a shower, Assistance with the toilet, Request a drink, Request Food, etc." It makes communicating discomfort much easier and probing the patient more simple without the need of the nurse to constantly ask questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used standard web development tools to build a simple and friendly user interface. It was extremely important that the icons and buttons were well defined and appropriately spaced so that the eye tracking could accurately select items of the website. The most important feature of this hack was that it was easy to use because when one is paralyzed and can only use the eyes, one is very restricted in their ability to troubleshoot any issues that arise. A neutral gentle color scheme was used so as not to cause strain on the eyes of those using the application over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with figuring out how to feed the eye gazing data into the cursor movement. Registering the eye movement was the most difficult portion. We originally believed that by using webgazer.js we could automatically implement cursor movement and function. That was not the case. Webgazer.js only tracks ones eyes and were the eyes are looking. We invented something completely new that will make eye tracking software accessible to everyone through the internet whereas most eye tracking technology is confined to install-able software packages. 
Furthermore, it was difficult to incorporate twilio using only .js to make it a client-side based feature. We had to use php.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something completely new even if the idea isn't entirely new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of javascript.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enhancing the stability of the eyetracking feature to match that of Tobii and making it available to everyone for free. It would be amazing to be able to incorporate an entertainment function as well, such as a game demo (which is fairly simple) or Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu video services. We'd also like to organize the messenger services to be more of a chat room so that one can receive responses.
