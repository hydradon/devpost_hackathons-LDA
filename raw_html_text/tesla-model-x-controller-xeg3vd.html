                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found Intrepid's tech talk very interesting and are fans of Tesla vehicles. As such, we decided to create something utilizing Intrepid's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Android app uses the android os built in speech recognition to launch various commands from Intrepid's API including opening/closing doors and windows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android Studio. The app utilizes Intrepid's neoOBD2 by interacting with their API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team have never created an Android app before so it was a little bit of a learning curve for all us. We also ran into some issues relating to the syntax of http requests but we eventually solved them after guidance from Intrepid. We also encountered quite a few merge conflicts and gained a greater understanding of version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this being our fist time competing in a hackathon we are proud of designing a full fledged android app in the course of a weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton this weekend! In particular we learned a lot more about how APIs work, how Android's built in speech library works, version control, and Android development in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tesla Model X Controller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Intrepid expands the API commands available we would like to expand what our app can accomplish as well. In the meantime we would like to add functionality for multiple commands at the same time in the future.
