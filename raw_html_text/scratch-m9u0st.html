                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The large influx of assignments and tasks due to school and life cause strain on the emotional state of people. Since without a license in the appropriate psychological fields, the only contribution to overall mental health we are able to make is to help relieve the stress brought on by day to day life. There have been various studies that have indicated that having a concrete written down task reduces the amount of thought and attention directed to said task. By doing this the amount of anxiety surrounding the task declines. Further, we aim to stimulate the human response to rewards and facilitate the willpower to continue on completing tasks at hand.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scratch is an interactive to-do list that rewards users with scratch cards revealing images sourced from various online resources to reward the users with positive stimuli.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built an Android application that allows you to either get an image from the internet, or upload your own, as a reward for completing a goal; the online images come from reddit.com/r/aww, and the scratch cards are powered by OpenCV for photo editing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reddit's API makes use of its asynchronous servers, which we had troubles integrating. OpenCV's methods did not work as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out OpenCV and Android methods and techniques quickly in the limited time that we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned photo manipulating techniques from OpenCV, and made a few tools of our own based on photo editing tools.
                </p>

                    What's next for Scratch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on fixing the application's various errors, and expanding it so that the to-do lists show up and send notifications properly.
