                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the data-driven economy and were intrigued by the fact that how many valuable data in the forms of emails and SMS were getting wasted and not being used for behavioral metrics.
So we wanted to make this data structured and help the millennials get their own credit rating score. This would also help financial companies to retain loyal customers for a longer time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It goes through your bank notifications, your social media behaviour, travel patterns, job, achievements, and education. And gives a credit score according to a metric that has been decided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected unstructured data and preprocessed it using nltk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, we got 99 challenges but jet-lag ain't one!
The primary challenge was to dump our initial idea that we came prepared for halfway through the hack and to build another one from scratch.
One technical challenge was to decide the behavioural data points for credit score calculation and also to develop the social scorecard.
Further, figuring out our way through integrating backend with frontend was challenging but awesome!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first mobile application so that's pretty cool.
Kinda made two projects in this hackathon, do message if you wanna know about the other one.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cliche but racing against time taught us to manage it better.
App-Development to credit systems. We learned about the blend of finance in the tech.

                    What's next for Cred-It Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating and optimizing according to the existing credit scoring systems. Testing our algorithms and removing and bugs. Will work ono more accurate results.
And who knows Microsoft Imagine Cup and HackHarvard Globals next year
