                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a new student at university, it can be challenging to find your way around on foot. Even with map services like Apple Maps, it's still not intuitive enough to get around. Our app addresses this issue by providing intuitive navigation directions with augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start off, users are able to search for a destination they want to go to. Afterwards, the the app displays the route to the destination on a map view. The user can then use augmented reality to navigate to where they want to go.
                </p>
