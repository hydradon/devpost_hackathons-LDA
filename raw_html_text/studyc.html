                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing the troubles people go through to try and set up study groups through a third party chat app called group me, we decided to give them a way to avoid all that struggle with integated course creation and live transcript translation from the professor to the chat to allow for anyone to never miss a lecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a canvas ref code, it adds you to global courses for your specific section, allowing you to study with your classmates. Also included is a mic recording feature for the professor to record lectures that get converted into blobs and sent to rev.ai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using a react front-end and a node-js backend. Packaged in a docker container, it allows us to easily modify a mongo-db database and allow for fast modifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we have yet to overcome is the full integration of rev.ai While we correctly convert the data to a blob and put it into a formData, the api seems to block our authentication due to an unknown reason. Passing this hurtle would complete the application, considering rev.ai's easy transcript response to post to the chat.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our multi level production and use of Docker, React, Node.js web socket server, rev.ai, canvas API, and mongoDB.
