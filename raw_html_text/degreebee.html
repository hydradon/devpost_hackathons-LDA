                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a junior and thinking about colleges and jobs has been tough and stressful, even though it's supposed to be a sign of independence and change. Many of my classmates have the same struggles when considering what they want to pursue in the future. Thus, I wanted to create an app to make the lives of students slightly easier and less stressful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Degreebee helps students explore various majors, allowing them to find jobs related to a major, discover colleges that offer the major, and connect with those who have experience or expertise in that major. Essentially, it composites all this useful information in a friendly user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the Android app, using many online tutorials. I basically learned Android by coding this project. The process was very tough, but I managed to survive. Then, I programmed a website to introduce the app, providing visuals to walkthrough the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble figuring out how I would store the information, as the database is essential to the app. I also had great trouble making the app have a consistent user interface, as Android had many presets that I had to override just to customize the app. As for the website, I had trouble formatting the slideshow of app screenshots as they had to fit in different sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of everything to be honest. However, customizing the fonts and the user interface has to be my favorite as I really want our app to give off a different impression that other similar apps. It is also very unthinkable how I managed to finish the Android app and the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the aspects to building a coherent Android app, as I had to edit all sorts of files and learn the origins of various functions in order to finish the app. I also learned how to integrate the SQLite database into the Android app and how to dynamically add data.  Furthermore, I learned how to build custom classes to override the functions of existing Android components. There were various other smaller things I learned that were also very useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for degreebee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more information, since detailed, comprehensive information is what will be most useful to students. In addition, I want to make an iOS app in order to make the app more accessible. For these next steps, I will need a larger team, as it requires a lot of work to enter lots of data. Then, hopefully the apps can be published on the app store.
