                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realised that many of times hawkers end up throwing away unconsumed food. Our solution aims to reduce the food wastage by offering nearby patrons food discount so that they will be tempted to grab their meals at a discounted price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the patrons' side, they will be able to access the telegram bot (based on the different type of food or based on nearby location) the discounted food offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the hawkers' side, they are able to offer meals discounts on a flask web app. These will help them see if they are cooking too much so that they can reduce the amount of food wastage.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use python telegram bot and flask web app and SQLite
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not prepared for hackathon, not enough time. The lack of knowledge in flask
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to complete the requirements we set out to achieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn how to use git better and about telegram bots. Learnt about the issues on the food industry. 
We should definitely come prepared for the hackathon.
