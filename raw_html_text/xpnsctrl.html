                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking expenses personally and for my business is becoming very hectic these days. So we decided to build an application, which we planned to allow user to access from any where. From mobile app, Slack, FB etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows user to add his expenses and get expenses based on various criteria. Also this application will allow user to upload the expenses with receipts to auditor. This app also help user control his spending based on his previous history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server application is built on Python with backend DB. All the data to the server is send / received to / from AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are quite a few challenges we gone through in building conversation with Lex. Apart from this we had lot of challenges in building from server application. As we still working on this application, we are continue facing lot of challenges in bringing interesting features into the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a  small team building this application working on new technology avenue is a real challenge. The way it is progressing we can really picture the future of the application. We can soon tell the accomplishments that we feel we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a great learning experience with Lex as we were using other platforms for conversation and speech integration in past. This provided us a great opportunity to learn Lex, Lambda extensively. Also we decided to continue with Lex and Lambda for this application and also decided to port existing application to Lex.

                    What's next for XpnsCtrl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this project on a different idea couple of months back and we pivoted this idea recently. So we couldn't add many features into this application. But we will add all new interesting stuff in coming months and get this application ready for customers.
