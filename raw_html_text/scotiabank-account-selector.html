                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering that this Hackathon's theme is "An idea that can be banked on", we decided to focus on a topic that will help build financial literacy to the general public. Sometimes, it's difficult for a young adult or a student to choose the right bank account with the confusing terms used in websites. We wanted to make a user friendly interface which lets the user input their financial criteria and output a suitable banking account to fit their needs.
