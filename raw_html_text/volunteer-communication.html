                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people volunteer for the society but there may be cases where their efforts go unnoticed. Sometimes, the non-profits don't have records to determine the number of hours people have spent volunteering for their organization. To facilitate this task for the non-profits, we present an application that helps them to communicate easily with the volunteers regarding their availability and also maintain a record of volunteering hours of each volunteer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two major components to our application. The first is the volunteer communication form which a volunteer is expected to fill up to sign up for volunteering for a variety of events that non-profit (Swift) hosts. Based on the response, communication via text and email is sent out to the volunteer. Volunteers are also sent out a reminder before each event that they signed up for, ensuring that non-profits don't lose out if volunteers don't show up for the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second component of the application is a check-in form for the volunteers that they need to fill up when they attend an event. Based on their check-in their volunteer hours will be updated in the database, which will help the non-profits to keep track of the efforts of the volunteers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Vue.js for the front-end, node.js for backend and Postgres for the database. We have hosted the application on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The price constraint was a major component for our choices and limited our solution options.
Since our team has only backend experience, it was a challenge for us to learn and adapt in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we are able to build an application for the non-profit which can help them significantly to reduce their manual effort in signing up volunteer and maintaining the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we learned technologies like vue.js &amp; node.js and learned to host an application on Heroku
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Volunteer Communication
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add automating text notifications to volunteers for them to RSVP before events.
This would allow us to match the best volunteers for a specific event, increasing the show-up rate.
