                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to do something with JavaScript from the get-go. We all wanted to learn more about JavaScript and also wanted to fit the theme and use social media and other APIs. So we integrated all these ideas into one and came out with our project.

                <p>
                    What our project is supposed to do is scrub Twitter take the coordinates through JavaScript and plot all of them on a map.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to host a local server and then used Mapbox to make a map and tried to plot points on it. We also used the Twitter API to scrub twitter for certain hashtags and got the GPS coordinates for plotting them on the map.
