                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The persona of "Volunteer Victoria" given by Centene puts forth a quote "I love giving back to my community, it makes me feel fulfilled" that connects with all the team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has an app to connect the elderly people with the volunteers using voice and minimal buttons.
The volunteers can select the timeslots in which they can allocate their time in community service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ionic Framework 5 with firebase for the core functionality. The voice recognition and text to speech is implemented using the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using device specific features with the hybrid app and make it work across all platforms. Learning to use the APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully completed the minimal product idea in a time constraint environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twilio API with the Ionic framework and firebase. Explored new technologies and widened our horizons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BhudApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasing the accessibility of the app to make it easier for the elderly. Include further functionalities that address their other day to day needs like grocery shopping and some fun outdoor activities.
Considering that we were able to achieve the core functionalities of the app in just 24 hours, we think we can implement the other ideas to make a very comprehensive app.
