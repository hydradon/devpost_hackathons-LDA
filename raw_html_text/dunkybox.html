                    CWiMO (Pronounced qwee-mo) is designed to make parties more personal and car rides more bearable. The idea behind CWiMO is that it provides a way for everyone sharing a music player to each hear a bit of what they want. And because CWiMO is cross platform, it'll work on iOS and Android so no one is left out. For example, someone hosting a party can plug in their phone to their speakers, start a room in the app, and begin adding music which will trigger the app to begin playing the music. Once guests show up, the host can give out the room key and the guests will then be able to join the room on their phone and begin adding their own music to the playlist.
