                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for "Battle of Wits" started with an idea to use the Muse: the brain sensing headset and the Myo armbands to execute simple commands, it then adapted into the idea of making a simple game that would require movement and concentration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Battle of Wits" is a game where two players use one headset and one Myo and connect their devices to their phones, the players then have to attack using the Myo but must remain calm, otherwise the headband will sense if the player becomes tense and their defense will drop, allowing the opponent to hit harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have worked on creating an Android app before, so it took a steep learning curve and determination to learn the ins and outs of the development environment. We had difficulty creating the user interface on the device as well as coding the attack and defense algorithms as well as making use of our sensor data in meaningful ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to display the health bar and incorporate the Myo as well as the Muse were a huge accomplishment. We have not worked on a mobile app before, so being able to see the game in action felt like a huge relief and a feat that we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Android SDK and the development environment, manipulating and editing code relating to hardware. We were able to practice with networking and using Firebase as our app server, we learned how to dissuades different ideas and eventually come to a fair compromise.
