                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to paint with water on the Processing canvas first. The animation of water failed, and led me to the simulation of particles and use Myo to control their moments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The feedback information from Myo that I use is orientation and gesture. Orientation controls the position of the flock of particles and the gesture is used for signals of zoom in and zoom out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using algorithms for particle generations, and Myo signals for controlling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Convert the roll, pitch, yaw into x, y, z coordinates, sending signals with Myo to control the motions.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time in hacksthon, and I learned to use processing for the first time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fluid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely should be using Myo as brush and use everything you like as your canvas.
