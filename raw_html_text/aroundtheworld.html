                <p>
                    Each user has their nationality stored and based on that we get the power of their passport (the countries they could visit without VISA). They have a starting amount of money and time limit which they have to use to their advantage in order to win the game. The goal is to visit every country without a VISA without running out of money or time. For every destination there are three different packages consisting of
                    <strong>
                        real-time price data
                    </strong>
                    for flights and hotel options extracted from Booking.com. The logic behind this is that the cheaper the package that you buy, the longer it takes you to reach your destination and rest (more time is subtracted from your countdown timer). However, for every country you visit your passive income grows higher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project using PHP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, XAMPP and Amadeus API to get real-time price data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to choose which API to utilize since every different product has its own advantages and disadvantages. We chose Amadeus API because it does not require you to be a business company and we can get 2000 free requests to the API. We feel like we made the correct decision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of delivering a working product as a team and everyone contributing to the project. It was truly a learning experience and we are glad that we got to share this moment together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past 24 hours we learned how to work with Amadeus API and further developed our web app skills. Working in a team is something that is definitely not new to use, however, it is always good to put skills into practice. Being able to express yourself and make important decisions in a group environment is a key part of a developer's skill set.
                </p>

                    We hope we could further expand the data that we have in order to make this project bigger.
