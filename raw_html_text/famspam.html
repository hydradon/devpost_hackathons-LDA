                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Email is an incredibly powerful and influential platform, but is used a lot for Spam, what if the power of email were given back to the users?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a combination Email list/Social media site. You can follow people, block others and send messages out in a controlled manner, most importantly, the user is in full control of what comes in and out, and can change at any time
