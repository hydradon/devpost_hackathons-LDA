                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is often very difficult to find local charities as most do not publically announce their existence. This allowed us to come up with a convenient way of accessing this data and increasing relations between the donor and the charity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects users to nearby charities and foundations and shows them options to see who they can contribute to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through a combination of the Google Maps API to show the locations based on the user's location, and the firebase database API to conduct user authorization and data management, we created a web app that permits users to view nearby non-profits/charities and donate necessary resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a decent amount of trouble with various javascript concepts and spent too much time on debugging the firebase interface allowing us to manipulate and access data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of being able to successfully use the Google Maps API to show and receive data regarding nonprofits in the local area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about using firebase in javascript, something we were not exposed to before, as well as the Google Maps API for web development, with Android being our primary focus prior to this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Paragon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more features in Paragon with a trending page for viewers to see what kind of charities and non-profits are currently effective to the public and allowing viewers to better make a choice on who they wish to support. Additionally, we wish to add more functionality relating the to GUI, allowing for a better user experience regardless of their status as a charity or a donor. We have made user accounts so that we can collect data about the user, and based on their search patterns, we will use machine learning to also better their search results, making this an even better app overtime.
