                <p>
                    Finding your first SWE/CS internship can be hard. Most students apply to hundreds of positions before they land their first internship. To speed up the application process LetterWriter helps generate new cover letters for every position you're applying to!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LetterWriter uses Beautiful Soup to scrape SWE/CS job postings on Linkedin and Indeed. The information is passed to a text parsing program that will generate new custom cover letters.
                </p>

                    Future Improvements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many job positions in the tech industry and cover letters must cater to different roles. We want to extend LetterWriter so that it utilizes more advance scraping methods to creates cover letters that better suit the roles you are applying to! Unfortunately, we have not implemented a .txt to .pdf convert yet.

                        <p>
                            Simply change the template.txt file to your own template cover letter. Use "JOB POSITION" and "COMPANY NAME" as place holders in your template.

                            Cover letters should appear in the same working directory once the program is done running.
