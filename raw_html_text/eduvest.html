Eduvest is a great way for beginners to learn the ropes of investing in stocks, using article sentiment and stock history as the features for the machine-learning model. We wanted to challenge ourselves and work with unfamiliar API's, so we decided on this idea after much discussion and debate! 
Users are given a series of articles and stock price charts relating to a random stock from a random previous year. Their goal is to analyze these resources and determine whether or not to invest in that company's stock or not. We then compare their decision with our machine-learned model!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built our web app on Flask with a Python back-end and HTML/JS front-end. Our biggest challenge was figuring out the machine-learning components, as most of us had no background or experience in it at all. The ML component was ultimately accomplished using Keras, though we briefly attempted to use Google Cloud's ML Engine before we decided to use something simpler.

                    Unfortunately, our end-of-hackathon product isn't complete, as we were unable to link together a few key features. Most of our members also had to leave early, so the last 12 hours were extremely tough. We hope to fix up these missing pieces soon, however! We were also thinking of helping the user determine how to distribute their investments over multiple stocks, since that was a feature in the Blackrock API that interested us but that we were unable to look into.

                    Stay tuned for the future of our project ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
