                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was using an elevator and it was just too quick
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an elevator that goes to and prioritizes its furthest possible destination
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not very good
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My error message manager works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am bad at python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Really Bad Elevator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I intend to make it worse in the future. Sometimes the elevator needs a break and will stop for coffee
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where's the demo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably on GitHub, you can do it
                </p>
