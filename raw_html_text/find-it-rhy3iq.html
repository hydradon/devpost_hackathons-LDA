                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got tired of losing things, especially smaller essential items in our daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user needs to find something, they press a button on their laptop that remotely activates a speaker and plays a loud noise
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two Arduino and Bluetooth cards, we remotely play a sound through a speaker when the user presses a button on their laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us know anything about hardware, and this was a complete learning experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing our project with it doing what we set out to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about hardware as a whole, how arduinos and Bluetooth chips work and interact with other parts of hardware. We learned a lot about circuits too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Find It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve the design and make it smaller, as well as adding GPS functionality.
