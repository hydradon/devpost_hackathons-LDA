                <p>
                    Understanding the consequences of ADHD/ADD in correlation with work ethic and focus because one of our team members suffers from ADHD, we felt it was necessary to create a new method for reminding individuals to get back to work.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working, students often do not recognize that they are off task or the extent to which they are distracted. G. O. T works to combat this issue by incorporating a pop-up when individuals are on a particular website that is distracting to their work such as gaming websites, Tumblr, etc. Along with this, a vibration is sent using the Myo ArmBand that refocuses the individual and allows them to recognize that they are off task.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app was created with google chrome extension and Myo ArmBand. We used a combination of Javascript and HTML. First, we followed Google's guide to creating a chrome extension, and altered the three given files to detect the site that the user is currently on. With if-else statements, the code decided whether the site was part of the predetermined "blacklist" of sites that are deemed distracting. We created alerts that would automatically remind the user to stay on task when on a particular site, instead of being distracted. Afterwards, this extension was connected to the Myo ArmBand which then caused a vibration on the user's arm due to code written in Javascript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With beginner level experience, we spent a majority of our time attempting to understand the code and hardware rather than creating. Additionally, our lack of knowledge and access to resources prohibited us from reaching the full capabilities of the Myo function.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our level of experience we are astonished that we have been able to complete as much as we have. With the little information available and intricate design of the Myo ArmBand and Chrome Extensions, we are proud that we have been able to understand and develop the technology to make G.O.T function properly. In the end, through the grueling hours of the night working hard, together, we are pleased to say that we have been able to create something substantial that we ourselves could benefit from in the near future.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of this hackathon, we learned how to use chrome extensions as well as became familiar with the Myo ArmBand. We discovered how to run a extension in a background and display popup notifications in the main window. Additionally, we figured out how to connect and code a Myo ArmBand to perform various activities as well as interact with the chrome extension. We strengthened our skills in JavaScript andHTML. Aside from the physical knowledge we gained, we were able to learn to work together and time manage in order to execute our idea with the time limit at hand. The most important thing we learned is the value of hacking and how important our creations, no matter how simple, are for the improvement of the online world.

                    What's next for G.O.T (Get On Task)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This two-part system can develop into an interface allowing the user to decide which sites to &ldquo;blacklist&rdquo; as well as repeated vibrations and popups with continuous usage of said sites. Additionally, the extension will expand to a vast majority of sites.  For example, if an individual wants to be warned away from Reddit, Tumblr, and Netflix, they will thus be able to personalize their experience.
