                    Creating something funny that users can enjoy was the only inspiration for this project.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was coded using Python and used the OpenCV library to detect face and overlay (or sometimes not) a funny filter. We began experimenting and learning how to use OpenCV until we were familiar enough to start hacking the project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One notable challenge was organization. The project was created and changed along the way and there was no real structure which led to some poor programming practice and less readable code. Another challenge was learning and finding tutorials on OpenCV. A lot of the time was spent on trying to find ways to create and implement filters in OpenCV with some filters failing to make it in the final revision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a working version of the application which also has a working GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major technology we learned was the OpenCV library. Other things include learning to open an image through code and the tkinter GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MemeMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would to use a form of AI to auto-generate captions and apply filters appropriate for each one. This way, there can be unlimited possibilities, instead of a current select few.
