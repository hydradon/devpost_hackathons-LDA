                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the interview process and recent developments in AI regarding facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mirror is a platform that will allow an interviewer to better understand how well their interviewee handles questions using facial recognition and analyzing emotional data gathered from the interviewee. Mirror collects this data from the interviewee and displays it with very pretty graphs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this app using Node.js and with API's from Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project had and still has a bit of problems. One of the biggest challenges was getting the video chat to work and after a lot of debugging we were able to get some nice video functionality.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of how we used Microsoft Azure to get real time analysis of the interviewee, the graphs also look pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about constructing a video chat platform, displaying data using Chart.js, and using Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would probably be brushing up and styling the website used for calls. IBM Watson integration for personality insights was something we were trying to put together and we think it would leverage the platform to a very effective service.
