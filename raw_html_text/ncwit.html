                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we tried two ways to make it work. First we use android studio and facebook API to build an app and login.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Hash keys - for security issues, since the app is still under development and not yet published or reviewed by a Facebook Manager, the client could only login once to our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We had a lot of issues with Android Studio Emulator not working in some computers.

                <p>
                    we did make out an app

                <p>
                    a lot. like android studio, cordova, ionic and so on.
-We attempted to use Facebook account to login to the app.

                        <p>
                            We first used Android Studio.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then we tried using Cordova and Angular.
