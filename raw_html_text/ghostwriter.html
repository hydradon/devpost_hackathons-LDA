                    In scripting, copy-pasting blocks of text is fast, simple, and effective. It's also boring. The solution: a command line accessible application that outputs blocks of text one character at a time. You'll swear a ghost was at the keyboard...
                </p>
                <p>
                    USAGE: (Command Line)
                </p>
                <p>
                    GhostWriter.ahk [options] mode content target
                </p>
                <p>
                    options: -fast  greatly reduces delays
                </p>
                <p>
                    modes:
                    <br>
                    t __       parrots content; ignores target param
                    <br>
                    f __      parrots file content; ignores target param
                    <br>

                    ff __     appends file content to target file
                    <br>
                    rc __     treats content and target as text; simultaneously outputs both on separate lines

                <p>
                    content:        the text to be parroted; mode may specify that it is actually a filename, whose contents should be parroted
                </p>
                <p>
                    target:         the file to be appended by content; may be ignored; for rc is treated as text

                    The included driver may be run to demo the application. As file system configurations may differ, the config section of the autohotkey files may need editing.
