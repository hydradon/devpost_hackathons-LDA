                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was a long time fortnite player, always thinking of new game play strategies, and tools that gets you the player stats can help you decide whether to take the next fight head on, or maybe not now and wait for the best moment.
But these player stats tools can require you to alt tab out of the game, or maybe take a space from your screen, so i developed this Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, you can inquiry about a certain player stats (like kills/deaths) to get an idea of how good your opponent is. You would say, "Get stats for Ninja", "Get stats for Myth"..
Also, if you're away from your pc, you can ask to check the Fortnite daily shop items.
And for the paid feature, you can ask "notify me when you see ITEM-NAME in the shop". To help you if you're looking to buy a rare item and not miss it. (for now, the skill checks the shop only when someone asks for shop, but it will remind u if someone else checked shop)
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly used Fortnite Tracker API, over node js and some web scraping with cheerio.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    As a beginner in developing Alexa skills, i had a not so easy trip reading various documentations about skills, because there was several documents to read from and i got confused.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Asking the user for reminders permissions using only voice on an Echo device, rather than sending a request to their phone.

                    Move the code to AWS, to have better/frequent reminders for the user.
