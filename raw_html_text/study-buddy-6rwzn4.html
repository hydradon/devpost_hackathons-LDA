                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we go to the library with the desire to study with a friend but that friend cancels on you, or your friends aren't in your classes. Students want to quickly find someone to study with and to stay on task.This was an idea brought up in my Human Computer Interaction class and I wanted to try creating prototypes for the idea to try my hand at User Experience Design.

                    Study Buddy connects you with a fellow classmate in the area who is studying the same class and in the same studying style as you.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a low fidelity prototype on paper, and used Adobe XD to create a high fidelity prototype. These wire frames just give an idea of how the application would run if it were to be built in a coding environment.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know how feasible this is to code. I liked the idea of having a map because it is definitely easier for users to see where possible study buddies are in the vicinity, but I felt like it might be complicated to implement, so I just went with a list view. It will be an idea I hope to further understand and revise.

                    Also I started this at midnight so I only had a few hours (less than nine) to create it and get some sleep, so I wish I had thought of this design sooner so that it had more detail and looked more like a final product.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am just really happy to finally submit a project. I've always been very scared to try at previous hackathons because the product wouldn't work or would be half finished, but I realized that it's always just better to try.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest thing I've learned is that these projects don't have to be full-fledged coding projects which is what has always worried me. I think hackathons are expanding to include artists and other liberal arts and sciences majors for an inclusive environment. And like I mentioned earlier, it's good to try a hand at a project and get good constructive feedback.

                    To turn it into an app that my school can use would be very cool.
