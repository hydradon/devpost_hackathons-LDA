                    We wanted to follow in Chef Gusteau's footsteps and promote the art of cooking. Little Chef is a simple interface that curates recipes for each user profile.

                    Little Chef pulls details from a given profile to return appropriate recipes available online.

                    React. At least we tried to.

                <p>
                    Using React. It was our first experience with it. We still have a
                    <em>
                        lot
                    </em>

                    We think it's a pretty cool idea. Also, we used React.
