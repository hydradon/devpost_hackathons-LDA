                    We wanted to use the voice abilities of Alexa/Echo to build some sort of useful tool. We thought studying with Alexa might be a good way. Many people use notecards to study, so having a verbal partner to study with could help students out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, you can ask Alexa to "quiz me on {subjectName}" and Alexa will search for a notecard set to quiz you on. You'll get asked ten questions and get scored at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We build this using a python server that would handle requests coming from Alexa. This server would interact with the Quizlet API to search up question sets based on keywords in your verbal request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges with Alexa not responding in louder environments and not picking up on all our keywords.
