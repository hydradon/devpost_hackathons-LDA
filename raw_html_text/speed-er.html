                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all began when Anand dislocated his shoulder while running into a wall. His parents took him to the closest Emergency Room in town, only to wait for over 3 hours in unbearable pain before the nurses could even get a X-Ray of his shoulder. That's when he realized an incredibly glaring problem that no one was even remotely attempting to solve. Not only were patients with varying amounts of excruciating pain forced to sign several documents before even being admitted, but they were also, in most cases, forced to wait for an indefinite amount of time before being looked at by a doctor or a nurse. In fact, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the average ER wait time in the United States is 55 minutes. Some, including 49-year old Illinois resident Beatrice Vance, have unfortunately passed away while in the waiting room at the ER. 
Such incredibly troubling cases have raised discussion about the problem at hand, but virtually no one has stepped forward to offer a solution. In fact, some physicians have even begun to advise their patients to completely avoid the ER. Anand and George, however, insisted otherwise. George had a lot of experience working in hospital and emergency rooms and suggested that this platform would be an excellent one to not only decrease Emergency Room wait times for patients, but also to make Emergency Rooms more efficient.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speed ER speeds up the amount of time between the time of injury of the patient and care for the patient. It allows anyone to create profiles in which they can enter in their health history and medical records, and allows hospitals to quick pull up and view these profiles when necessary. Also, when the patient injures himself or herself, he or she can report the injury with a few clicks and discover the most optimal Emergency Room to go to based on the estimated travel time and estimated average wait time. For life-threatening injuries, the platform would direct you to the closest hospital and place you at the top of the queue with no wait time. The patient would also be able to notify the hospitals that they will be arriving at the hospital soon, which would allow hospitals to have enough time to prepare for an incoming patient.

                    HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Google Place Search and Place Details Web Service APIs, HTML5 Speech Recognition API, Flask, AWS RDS, MySQL

                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask for web app development, geolocation and speech APIs, and the AWS Relational Database Service.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to work with hospitals to frequently update their average wait times every quarter of an hour in order to allow those using this platform to receive the most accurate and optimal choice of hospital to go to for treatment. We also plan to build a centralized system in which all patients would sign a single consent form (electronically) as opposed to signing a different consent form every time at hospitals. Furthermore, we plan to introduce two-factor authentication to increase an additional layer of security on confidential health information.
