                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by recent events on campus, this area's characteristic horrible weather, and classic side-scrollers such as Super Mario Brothers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It entertains and it challenges! You'll get a good laugh out of our game, and you'll likely be tempted to keep playing and playing for hours on end.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After about four hour's worth of brainstorming, I set to work on writing the bare skeleton of the code while my teammates designed the various sprites gameplay elements. Eventually I incorporated their sprites into the code and polished everything, tackling bugs when I came across them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The jumping mechanics were difficult to get just right, but eventually I found a way to give the jump mechanic a natural feel to it. The endlessly-scrolling background image was difficult to set up so it flowed seamlessly, but eventually I figured out a way to create instances of background objects so they appeared cohesive.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us are computer science majors, and of the three of us I was the only one with knowledge of Python. This made us a little nervous, but once we got to the ITC building we settled into a workflow and remained productive well into Sunday morning. Our final product may not be groundbreaking, but its controls are tight and in my opinion it is genuinely fun to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The differences between an .mp3 and .wav file are not negligible, for starters. We learned that one the hard way. More importantly, we learned how to build a game from the core outwards. We started with the core elements of gameplay, and saved cutscenes and other extraneous material for later on. There were some elements that we'd hoped to incorporate that we didn't have time to, but that didn't compromise our final product.

                <p>
                    We'll probably tweak it and then distribute it to the masses free of charge.
