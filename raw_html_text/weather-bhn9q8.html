                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time it rains at SCU, we see a few unaware and unfortunate souls running across campus in shorts and flip flops. We found that if there was a way they could get texts on their phones telling them the weather, they'd never forget to check.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a phone number, the program sends weather conditions and temperatures for 9am, noon, and 3pm to your phone and offers suggestions on clothing based on the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program uses the openweathermap.org API to gather weather information in Santa Clara and Twilio to send an SMS to your given phone number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a brick wall with setting up Twilio, but we eventually got it to work. We also had a lot of hopes for our project but realized later on that it was becoming too complicated to implement, so we simplified it in order to finish our work and meet the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully parsed the information needed from the information that came in as Json and found out how to make an application that could send text messages to phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became more fluent with python and Json formatting. We also learned to send SMS messages using a script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make it so that the script runs every day at a given time and sends the SMS accordingly.
