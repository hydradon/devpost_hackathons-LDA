                    If there were a reward for most indecisive, there is no doubt that we would win. A quick look at our github repository will reveal that we have changed topics, platforms, IDEs, Operating Systems, and motivations numerous times (at least 5 different projects). It all began when we wanted to develop a Soundboard in Mixed Reality. Luckily, another group that was able to get MR working was able to adopt the the same idea.When we realized that our experience was lacking and we would struggle to even create scenes in Unity, we pivoted for the first time. Between our first project and our last we tried everything from MicroStrategy HyperIntelligence to fractal tree mobile apps, and came full circle back to another Soundboard! None of us had experience with Arduino, so we decided that we were going to have fun and make something cool with some hardware we have always wanted to try. We designated different tasks like creating a UI, building the arduino, coding arduino, and developing the backend in python to take the arduino data and send it to play the sound.
