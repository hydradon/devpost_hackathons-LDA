                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We all love to bike around campus but would love a greater sense of protection (at low cost).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our own quasi-servers/database. We had a lot of trouble with Azure and other services since none of us are CS majors (2 Mechanical Engineers and 2 Electrical Engineers), so we just decided to bypass all of that and make our own, which is something we are definitely very proud of. Everything is mostly handled by socket programming in Python, and the database management is done with Java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running the DragonBoard headless was definitely very tricky, especially given that Debian is a lot trickier than Ubuntu. Also, socket programming got pretty nasty at times. All connections were reliable, but early testing often required a full power cycle to kill

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bypassed entire servers and built a (very scaled-down) DIY version!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the difficulty of merging different languages. We all did not have the same knowledge coming in, but we understood that and did our best to work with what we had.

                    Migrate to mobile interface, provide QR functionality, strengthen electromagnet locking, reliability testing, shift from socket programming to an actual website
