                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting patients with medical professionals is an important part of healthcare. If patients are unable to find and schedule appointments with the correct doctor for them, their health may suffer and costs of treatment may be higher in the long term. Despite this, many people have difficulty getting the right medical care within a reasonable timeframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Healix helps people schedule appointments with medical professionals as soon as possible, leading to reduced healthcare costs and better patient outcomes. Healix's powerful search finds local doctors and specialists within a patient's insurance network. In addition to location, users can search for doctors by specialization or name. They can then schedule appointments online directly from the search results, and view their current appointments on their user page. Patients don't need to call each doctor or specialist to check his or her availability. By reducing the cost and effort of making an appointment, patients can get help sooner and doctors' offices can manage their patients more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Python/Flask backend framework with a React front-end framework(React/Redux). We found an API online called BetterDoctor that gave us access to a database of doctor information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was that not everyone on the team was familiar with the tech stack that we chose to use to build this project. Some did not know Python and some did not know React or Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that even though not everyone knew the tech stack, we were able to unify and share whatever knowledge we had with each other and help each other out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning how to work effectively as a team, we learned about the usefulness of digitization and standardization in the medical industry. For instance, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry allows us to query doctors on a national level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Healix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At BostonHacks 2017, we created a patient side of Healix app. In the future, we hope to integrate hospitals and doctors' offices directly by developing a dashboard for doctors to manage their clients and availability.
