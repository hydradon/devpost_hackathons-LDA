                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cargo theft is a big problem across the world. About $5 billion dollars worth of goods is stolen every year.
Not only does this have a financial impact on the companies but a social impact on the public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our work assists cargo companies and truck drivers to secure their cargo while on the road.
By taking advantage of the dash camera, we used machine learning to recognize if the person sitting in the front seat is the correct driver.
If the driver has a change in the face then a security company will be alerted.
The emergency response teams will receive a string like the one below:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        "ALERT! Your Truck has been hijacked!
Driver:Steven
VIN:4V4MC9EH7CN559763
Location:https://www.google.com/maps/place/45.454, -79.32234
                    </code>
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using android studio we developed an application that determines a face change in the driver.
When detecting this change a security company will be messaged with location and other valuable details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Firebase ML kit to work with Android and making the facial recognition algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement the facial recognition system with the alert message being sent to the Emergency response teams during the act of theft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the use of Android Studio and Firebase ML Kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Strucks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If Strucks could be advanced further then there is potential for companies to save millions of dollars and lower crime rates across the world. 
If Strucks takes off then m.ore hardware components such as pressure plates to detect trailer detachment.
We are also thinking of implementing blockchain transaction to unlock the truck cabin or detach the trailer.
