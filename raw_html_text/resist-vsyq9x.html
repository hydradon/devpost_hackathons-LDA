                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent amount of protests occurring around the US inspired us to create an easy to use platform that helps users find events/protests that match the social issues that they are passionate about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to select social issues that they are passionate about and presents them with the information they need to be more involved in making a difference in their community. Events and protests close to the user's location are displayed to them on the newsfeed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app with Xcode, and the programming language used was Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were both new to using Xcode, we ran into many challenges. It was often hard for us to understand the error logs since we only had experience with Java, but using this prior knowledge as well as researching online allowed us to fix many of these challenges.

                <p>
                    We are proud of making a clean, easy to navigate user interface.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of app development as well as the programming language Swift.

                    What's next for Resist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a new section to our app that allows users to create their own protests. We hope to do this by allowing users to make accounts on our app.
