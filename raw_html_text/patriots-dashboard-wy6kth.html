                    How we built it - At a high level, the application is hosted on an apache web-server which is connected to a Mysql database. The database is utilized for storing and retrieving values. The front end of the website was built primarily using HTML and CSS. API's are incorporated into the website to stream data obtained from other sources such as facebook and the UTTyler.edu website.
