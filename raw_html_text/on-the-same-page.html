                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conducting biomedical research is hugely important - without research, there is no innovation. The results of biomedical research can save lives - but we also need to consider the lives of the people that participate in research, as human subjects. Informed consent from the subject is required for their participation in research, but truly informed consent is often difficult to achieve. Socioeconomically and educationally disadvantaged groups are particularly vulnerable to unethical research practices if they can not fully understand the information presented to them about the study on the consent form. If these people had an additional resource to aid in their comprehension of the research study under consideration, then this would be an added protection to their safety and human rights.

                    On The Same Page accepts text from a user and scans for difficult words and medical terms that may not be fully understood by a person reading a consent form for a clinical trial or other human subject research and defines the terms to help the user make a more informed choice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OTSP is a Python-based web application created using the Google App Engine framework. We used the TwinWords Dictionary API to access definitions and to determine the difficulty level of each term. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website.
