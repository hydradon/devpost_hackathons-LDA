                <p>
                    We came up with different ideas and voted on one that would have a long-term positive impact on society.
We identified our strength and weakness  then allocated task accordingly. Some individuals focused on the front end while others focused on the backend.
 To ensure unity, we would collaborate every hour and talk about  our individual progress and challenges regarding design, backend or API usage.

                    We had only 24rs to come up with a working solution, therefore, we could not add all the features we desired.
We had a limited time to explore and experiment with new APIs such as ESRI which lead to difficulties understanding it and using its full potential .
