                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make organising meetings as easy and cost efficient as possible. We all want to meet our friends but the stresses of arranging a place to meet can make this very difficult for us. Meetings Planner lets users arrange meetings at a click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meetings planner is a website where the user inputs the locations of the people who want to meet and the dates between which they are all available. Meetings Planner then finds the cheapest place for the users to meet, guaranteeing that one user in the group does not have to take a flight at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the skyscanner api to access the flight times and javascript to sort the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in the team had ever used javascript or html so we had to learn the languages from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Meetings Planner does return the cheapest destination to meet and the total travel cost for the group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make websites and what API's are and how to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meetings Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be good if Meetings Planner could find the cheapest location for the group to meet without one person in the group to not have to travel. Meetings Planner could also find cheap hotels in the area using a live pricing.
