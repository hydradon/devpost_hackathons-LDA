                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to get into the classes that we wanted to and missing out with the current alert system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checks the Schedule of courses website whether the class is open or not and enrolls you in the course if it is open.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is built with Flask and Selenium in Python. The Flask web app initiates Selenium once all the information is entered
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedule builder's website design made it a challenge to get the correct info and click the correct buttons. Also it was our first time using a framework like Selenium so challenges getting it running correctly came up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a finished product that has at least minimal functionality and does what we set out to do. We are also proud to have learned two new frameworks in Python from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that staying up past 4am makes you much less productive and make a lot of small mistakes. On a more serious note we learned how to use Github more efficiently and a basic understanding of Flask and Selenium.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SlydeIn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SlydeIn is far from a finished product. It could benefit heavily from some error checking especially in input. We also would like the product to scrape the site multiple times an hour to actually monitor the opening of the class for you.
