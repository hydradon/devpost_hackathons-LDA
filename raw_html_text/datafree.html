                    Datafree.io is a push towards increased online presence and social awareness. Datafree.io allows users to stay connected to current events happening through SMS messaging even when not physically connected to the internet. Our application offers access to top social media websites&rsquo; popular content and even allows remote connection to Google Maps for directions. Never feel disconnected from popular trending stories on social media or lost without data for Google Maps.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Twilio we utilized SMS messaging and phone call inputs in order to contact a Google Cloud hosted NodeJS server to scrape inputs off the web and return the appropriate message through voice or SMS messaging.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into numerous challenges in using Twilio, since none of us have ever used Twilio. We had to figure out how to use the NodeJS server to communicate with the Twilio API and users. Another challenge we encountered was how to pull relevant data from the various website APIs.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working on this project, we were able to see the limitless potential of Twilio messaging service and how it is utilized in many products today. We were also able to learn a little about the Google Cloud Platform while setting up our NodeJS server and the various capabilities associated with it.
