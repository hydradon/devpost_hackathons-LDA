                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all had unpleasant experiences with student health related to long waiting times. Specifically, one of our team members recently waited an hour and a half for an appointment while experiencing a serious illness. Some health care professionals mentioned being overwhelmed by the large influx of students all at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XWait informs users the current wait time at student health during walk-in hours. The goal is to allow students to see the wait time and to check in remotely if they wish to be seen. We added intake forms to the application to decrease the overall wait time taken up by completing forms in-office.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By leveraging the ease of UI integration from Native Script on the IOS platform a very easy to build and manipulate application can be created. In addition to this, the relative ease of integrating express.js with other javascript components creates an easy to understand back end that delivers information responsively to consumers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest obstacles included: version control mix-ups, NPM version problems, node version problems (biggest one), Native Script http request issues, and google cloud inexperience.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully got Native Script to work, hooked up the back end, and created a product that actually works.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interprofessional cooperation allowed us to share different viewpoints on our idea from both the technological and healthcare perspective.

                    What's next for Xwait
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XWait aims to further its reach to acute healthcare centers, such as urgent care clinics, outpatient care centers, and/or emergency rooms. This will allow a user to compare wait times for different facilities and to optimize their care conveniently.
