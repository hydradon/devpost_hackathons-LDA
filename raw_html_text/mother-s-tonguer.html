                    Growing up as child with little or no experience with computer and also finding yourself in a polytechnic where tech guys rule and those who have no knowledge or bad at programming are not really valued. My name is

                    i started programming with paper and pen using red pen to mark my error, black for keywords and blue for the other part. I finally got a system during my second semester as a first year student of the institution and took it has a task to help other student who have no system by helping them with practicals and assignment although this later turn to business and a team named UnifyConcept emerge to help making innovation simple with little or no cost. My team and i really think we can make a difference but no opportunity showed up nor sponsorship until now when we have an avenue to do what we do best.

                    I came across a link telling me about

                    </strong>
                    on a dev whatsapp group so i informed my guys about it of which we plan on working on a project called

                        The problem of language teaching and language use is a global one

                    . Several studies have been carried out and several attempts have been made by individuals, government agents and other stakes holders in the education sector with several policies formulated, all in an effort to address the problems militating against effective language teaching and language use in our schools, with the aim of bringing an improvement to the much important phenomenon of which none as being done until now.

A text to speech application that converts text to speech upon a button click is also included to makes learning fun although the conversion is currently to English language which happen to be the official language generally adopted in Nigeria
