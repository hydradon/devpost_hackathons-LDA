                <p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    The application is cloud hosted on DigitalOcean and uses Django to serve a web page. It also uses a sms chat bot using the Twilio API as a way to reach out to those without constant access to computers or smartphones.

                <p>
                    We had a lot of ideas and we knew we didn't have time to implement all of them!
