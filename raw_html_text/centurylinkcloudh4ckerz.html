                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a clean and simple HMIS solution that provides a global picture of the housing, service, and resource availability for a given client. Additionally, we wanted to provide a way to crowd-source additional temporary housing in an emergency by connecting CoCs with emergency housing from the churches, hotels, and members of the general public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a given client, it provides a real-time customized suggestion of shelters and services that are suitable for that client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it could do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given more time, we would have loved to build out the app, including the volunteer system that first inspired us, a more intelligent rules engine, a dashboard with forecasting,  and access to details about clients, volunteers, and providers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork and lots of caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor wifi access hampered us quite a bit in the beginning. We also struggled a bit to come up with a finalized solution. 
As the hours wore on, we decided to pivot and sacrifice our ambitious crowd sourcing idea to focus on implementing a few core features of an HMIS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make up for some of our lost time pulling late hours. In the end, we were able to put together a working full stack demo that, while somewhat feature limited, we're all proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the homelessness problem and realized there are creative ways to solve issues like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also were pushed out of our comfort zones.  Being believers in "agile" methodologies, we prioritize collaboration and thoughtful problem solving over hard deadlines; we found that was somewhat detrimental in this kind of environment, where it's key to quickly decide on a plan and start bangin' out code!
                </p>
