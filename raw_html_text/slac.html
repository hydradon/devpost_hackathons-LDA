                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that would help improve the overall hospital experience for both customers and professionals, by allowing hospitals to fully utilize all of their medical equipment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SLAC allows for doctors and nurses to track where in a hospital precious equipment is, and provides a simple communication platform for doctors and nurses to make requests and efficiently transfer equipment when needed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile app with Android Studio in Java, the hardware with Arduino in C++, and the database with SQL/JDBC
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with front-end work, so getting a prototype for our app was a challenging obstacle. Additionally, we ran into several problems regarding how to best handle communication between the hardware, database, and mobile app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QHacks was the first hackathon for three out of our four members, and we were able to conceptualize and prototype a product that we believe can have a real-world impact on hospital efficiency and operations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that design is a never-ending process, and that the key to improving our product will be to evaluate and assess its performance and effectiveness while in use by healthcare professionals
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SLAC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the UI for a more intuitive, stress and hassle free user experience, expanding the database to assist hospitals with equipment life cycle management
