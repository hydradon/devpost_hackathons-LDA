                    4 freshmen college students, who were never able to get into a frat party, decided to make a useful application for parties in hopes of getting invited. DJ Khaaled is an automated DJ that uses the accelerometer data from people's smartphones and compiles the streams to get a crowd sentiment value. Using this value, DJ Khaaled makes use of the Spotify API to adjust the music to match the mood of the room. For example, if its is detected that people are very stagnant and not active, DJ Khaaled will change the song to something more upbeat. On the other hand, after a very fast paced song, DJ Khaaled will change to a slower song to give people a breather.
