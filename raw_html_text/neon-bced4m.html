                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a world full of hackers and bots, there is a need for fair trade while maintaining security and trustworthiness. That is why blockchain will allow us to provide this service for auctions. With the help of the API from Luno, we wanted to increase the integrity of auctions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While auctions could be done by bots and users can never be sure if they are fast enough to buy an item. We have created a system that allows a user to do safe and secure auctions. It changes the way the world sees auction.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really liked Luno's API for python so we used it to send money from the bidders to the server and from the server to the seller.

                <p>
                    We came up with a very nice idea and we think that it has lots of potential to be something really big.
