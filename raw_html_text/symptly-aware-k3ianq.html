                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Symptly Aware was inspired by the damage that illnesses can have in disturbing our everyday lives, and by the general lack of knowledge on the spread of diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app collects user data on the various symptoms that are experienced in your area. We compiled this data into our server, and display the symptoms data on our app, helping you understand the current spread of diseases throughout your area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to have Symptly Aware accessible to all types of people, we decided to make it an Android App. 
To do this, we used Android Studio connected to GitHub. We used Android Studio as the platform on which we developed our app, and we used GitHub for our collaborating platform on the cloud. We also used the Google Maps API in order to display symptom data onto our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While developing this app, it was hard to use the google maps api and connecting to the server when posting data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of our ability to overcome the difficulties that we ran into. For instance, we had problems using the Google Maps API to display a pinpointed map of symptoms in your region. Eventually however, we were able to break through and move on with continual dedication. We are also proud of our app&rsquo;s sleek design, giving our product a more professional feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that persistence and dedication have the ability to overcome even the most difficult of problems. As long as we were focused on the task at hand, we could climb our largest stumps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Symptly Aware
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to release our app onto the app store, and hopefully watch its user base grow. We also hope that with the knowledge that this app gives the user, people can be more aware and alert of the diseases and illnesses that are spreading around their area.
