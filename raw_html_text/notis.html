                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our app came from how more young adults are now traveling around the world, whether it be to study abroad, a class trip, or just to experience the culture of another country. With the dangers in today&rsquo;s world, we wanted to create an app that would help young adults feel safe and more secure when traveling to unfamiliar places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a tool that centralizes all of your traveling needs.  By combining public transportation, lodging, emergency contact information, and local points of interest, a user can rest assured that they are safe when traveling to unfamiliar places.  The app uses the phone&rsquo;s GPS to fluidly change the information provided to the user based on current location.  The interface consists of five categories: Emergency, Transportation, Travel Warnings, Lodging, and Country Information.  When a user chooses a category, they are provided with its corresponding information and the option to call for assistance right from the app.  Take a real life situation, someone walking down a city street sees someone following them and wants to subtly let police know that they are worried for their safety.  With one tap, the user can contact law enforcement, notify loved ones of the dangerous situation and send the police their current location in real-time.  This app is an innovation in first-response, because of its ease of use, and utilization of technologies that are found in our pocket, but haven&rsquo;t yet been adhered to by law enforcement.  We know that our app can keep people safe, and allow them to feel secure wherever they travel.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Intel XDK, the ionic framework, HTML5, javascript, and CSS3. We also used GitHub to host and share resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was translating our ideal vision for the app into a functional prototype rather than the image-based proof of concept. With the time constraint, we had to keep the app as simple and easy to use as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to turn our image-based idea into an actual working prototype with functional elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Notis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing to work on developing Notis so that it will be able to have the more advanced features, such as having a panic alarm or being able to call the local emergency number (ex. 911), that we had in our original idea.  We also envision being able to enable an always-listening feature to the app, where if a certain key phrase is said, the phone will emit a piercing noise to alert others nearby of impending danger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained important insight into deploying a working prototype to Google Play, which our team has never done before.  We also learned a lot about html/css and using javascript.
