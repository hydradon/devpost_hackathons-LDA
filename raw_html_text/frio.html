                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, it's tough to know what meals to make and even more so where to find the cheapest and closest ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Frio does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, we built a web app that allows you to input ingredients and receive recipes as its core functionality. It also allows people to scan their receipts and input data from local grocery stores to help those around them to identify the best way to get food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How Frio is built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask on the backend and HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend. We also used Google Cloud's Computer Vision API to pull data from photos of receipts to add to a SQL database of JSON-represented ingredient prices for users to access. We also integrated Spoonacular's recipe generating API to convert lists of ingredients into recipes tagged with many attributes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges Frio ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A week ago, we were asked: "Do you know the difference between the front and backend by an intimidating Facebook employee. Our answer? "Uh... no.. not really :/" One of the largest challenges was really just crossing the barrier of beginning and having the faith in ourselves to pick up many new skills at one time. From this challenge also came the most rewarding aspect. Going from basically clueless to building our own functional, impactful web app in just a few days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all extremely proud of each other. We put the trust in each other to tackle different aspects on our own and in the end work together to fit it together into a beautiful final product. From our fridge graphic design to the backend Flask framework, we have created a wonderful thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many hard skills as well as soft skills. Not only do we know many more tools now, but we also know how to work in a team effectively in stressful times and be able to communicate well with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Computer Vision into our community price database, creating a network of food-aware citizens sharing their experiences with local grocers and allowing users to determine the best location to visit for their cooking plans. We have already utilized Google Cloud API to pull information from receipts, and plan on continuing working on this aspect. Up next, we want to make our app more robust, allowing full-functionality of our recipe-reading algorithm. We also want to expand on a price database and be able to allow users more databases to look off of.
