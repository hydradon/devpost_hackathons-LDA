                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates was lost in downtown LA and had no idea how to drive back. He had no data on his phone left and so was very distressed. He ended up calling someone else to get directions via text and on the call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds you directions to your destination all via text! Forget cellular data, Wi-Fi, My-Fi, Internet. We use your cell phone carrier to guide you. Move out of the way MapQuest. Here comes MapText.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API to find directions from a start to destination address. We used Twilio
to communicate with a server using text and used a Flask server to communicate the directions back to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first trial Twilio account we created did not work for some reason; the website showed that messages were being delivered but they did not appear on our phones.
We were initally more ambitious and wanted a step-by-step navigation system via text based on your location (for which we would need to make a mobile app), but we forgoed it for this simpler model.

                    It works

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we interfaced with the Google Maps API or used Twilio. In our project we identified a basic problem and devised a simple solution to address it to produce a useful application!
