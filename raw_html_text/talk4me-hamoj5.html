                    Online dating is hard. You have the same conversations over and over again with the same people. Why not have a chatbot and use personality insights to find the good dates from the bad ones?

                    Built on watson chatbot trained on who you are and what you do, Talk4Me simultaneously proxies the conversational starters with dozens of people. From each thread, Text4Me uses the IBM personality api to highlight conversationalists who match you based on historical information. For those who don't carry good conversations, Talk4Me matches with the same quality of engagement.
