                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw other accessibility projects like the Xbox One Access controller and noticed how that we could do the same to help. We also wanted to create a game optimized for physical therapy that was free to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps those who need to complete physical therapy in a fund and interactive way. It also allows data export to help professionals understand the needs of their patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build it, we imagined the applications of a simple game when combined with dynamic information collection and exercise suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems calibrating the scores and were not able to complete everything as wanted due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that we were able to create a great program to help alleviate the boredom associated with physical therapy and were able to create a way for healthcare professionals to help their patients better.
                </p>
