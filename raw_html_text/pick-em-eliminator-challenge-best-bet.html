                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, Matthew played in an Eliminator Challenge with his dad. He lost in week 5 out of 17. We wanted to see what an optimal strategy would look like and how likely it would be to win.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes in the NFL schedule and current ELO ratings of every team, and picks one team each week such that the probability of every pick being correct (i.e. winning their game) is maximized. Win probabilities are calculated based on 538's model
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded data from 538, read it into Python, and used the PuLP library to solve the relevant Mixed Integer Linear Program
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PuLP was not well documented. We also tried to use Julia and MatLab, without success
                </p>

                <p>
                    It works as well as it is supposed to. The program solves very quickly.

                    What's next for Pick'Em Eliminator Challenge Best Bet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is trying to develop a set of 17 week pick strategies that maximizes that probability that at least one pick
strategy wins every game. The scenario here is that we are allowed multiple submissions, and really only need to win once (as in, have one of our entries win every game of the season) to justify our investment, so we want to decrease variance as much as possible. We could also allow the model to update ELO on its own instead of requiring a new file, but that wouldn't really make it much easier to use because it would still need to get the results from the previous week.
