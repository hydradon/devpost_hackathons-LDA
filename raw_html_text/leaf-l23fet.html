                    </em>
                    is built on Xcode. Most codes, UI and algorithms are created on Xcode. They include time count down and ranking between users. We created icons and some interface elements on Paint 3D. The flower recognition function is based on a Core ML model originally made by Maria-Elena Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman of Oxford University. Our team link it with the cell phone camera and create an algorithm that process image resolution.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Most of our team members have little experience with mobile software development and relevant UI design. We have to spend lost of time to get familiar with the Xcode and design our interface from scratch. Also, there are little resources about flower classification program. We need to do lots of adjustments to coordinate the model online with our application.

                    is to create a database store the distribution of plants in UCLA region and enhance our path creation system. With the completion of this step, our application can provide more mature and accurate customized daily task. We also wish to build a connection to environmental groups to protect green in real life.
