                    The origin of the idea was from a Facebook ad for a vibration metronome. The ad was pitching a dedicated piece of hardware as a metronome, to which I thought, "Why not just make it a smartwatch app?"

                <p>
                    The project is written in C.
                    <strong>
                        My greatest difficulty was that the project was in C
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to try out writing a project in C, but came across an issue where I couldn't figure out how to both have the metronome running and have the watch wait for input. My approach was a JavaScript-esqe solution of using async, but that wasn't an option. My solution came from the watch's stopwatch app: set a timer that will delay the vibration between tics, like delayed recursion. This allows the app to receive input between vibrations.
