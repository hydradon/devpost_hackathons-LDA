                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As kids we all loved playing with snowballs in winter. But winter doesn't last forever, so we decided to bring the experience of playing with snow to a game. Get cozy and enjoy the environment!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You roll a snowball to move around the playground and collect presents. Some of them are not easy to get! And beware... the dark fluffy bears love snowballs and they want to get you, but that would melt you - you'll have to avoid them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3d, a great platform for making games. The assets and models were selected from the freely available ones on the Unity store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make it a VR game, but compiling for a Google Cardboard turned out to be... out of the scope of this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game looks so pretty!
                </p>
