                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Close friends play a vital role in the lives of those struggling with mental health issues. Often times, people underestimate how stressful it is to help someone in the heat of the moment. In order to provide convenient guidance, we wanted to create a mobile app that is accessible to immediate step-by-step mental health "first-aid" from breathing to grounding exercises.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By voice command, Your Mind will pull up immediate exercises for the specified mental health issue (e.g. panic attacks). Your Mind will then walk you through steps for your friend in need for you to support them in their time of struggle. With an account, the issue occurrences can be tracked. If the data shows it is necessary, Your Mind will recommend the appropriate consultation institutions near you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by using Figma to create a prototype: starting with low fidelity and moving into greater detail as we narrowed in on what we wanted to achieve. We then worked to set up the Amazon Echo and use Amazon Web Services to connect and build a new 'skill' for the Amazon Echo that can be used when prompted with a voice command!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When working with the Amazon Alexa, the recommended language was node.js, as a team none of us were familiar with this language so we started from the ground up and used all of our resources to develop a good understanding of the language quickly and efficiently!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming a piece of hardware and using Figma were both new experiences and we are proud to have been able to implement both aspects into our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest lesson at this hackathon was how to generate a simple but effective prototype using Figma. We learned the value of planning out an idea and going through a design process prior to diving into the programming aspect, this helped us understand as a team what we wanted to accomplish and saved us confusion later on!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Your Mind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop a method of tracking history with panic attacks and analyse data to recognize patterns using a series of follow up questions after the immediate response has been used, this will allow the patient to recognize areas or situations in their life that are of high stress and how they can make changes to reduce panic attacks.
