                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The W.O.M.A.N. INC talk made a point that women may not always be comfortable calling in and how a chatbox would be useful. We wanted to add in a language translation as that was a pressing issue for both W.O.M.A.N. INC and SF Safehouse, however we ran out of time to implement it.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a client to have a secure 1-on-1 connection to a shelter they feel fits them best. However, it is not an emergency line of contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extreme Patience, tears, and lots of researching on how to implement certain features into the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of front end experience, difficulty getting the code to cooperate for precise changes to design
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    The entire front end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    On the spot front end development, and time management.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Help Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One feature we would like to add, since we ran out of time is language translation. Especially since it was mentioned to be a large issue, it would hopefully allow non-English speaking clients to get the help they need even if there was no native speakers available for them to speak with.
