                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many currently used online chatting services do not employ end to end encryption. As computer scientists we know the dangers of not having data properly secured. Our goal was to make a program to allow us to securely communicate over the web, and we believe we succeeded in that goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows for completely secure chatting between you and your friends. You add friends by simply pasting in their public RSA encryption key. It save your contacts from computer to computer all you need to keep track of is your .profile file. Every piece of data is end to end secured so you know you are the only one who can access your data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java for the entire project along with the use of a open source library called JFoenix in order to make the material design guis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was learning so many new technologies in such a small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that finishing a working product in the short time that we had is an accomplishment in and of its self. On top of that the project we went with was no simple goal. Our chat program can be used right now to securely send messages over the internet. We see finishing a project of this scale as our biggest accomplishment for this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the corse of this project we learned about many new technologies such as the JFoenix api, the java RSA encryption apis, and advanced use of java sockets.
                </p>

                    What's next for Murmur
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From here it's simple jump to add audio video and many other form of communication. As for scaling we plan to look into Amazon AWS for the server side of the application.
