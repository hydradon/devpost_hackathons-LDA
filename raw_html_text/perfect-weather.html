                    What it does - In a perfect world, our project would assist users by asking an AI what the best days for an event would be, or requesting when certain weather would take place.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Changing idea from different topics. Implementation issues due to time required to learn new programs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Learned the basics of Google &amp; AccuWeather APIs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - How to adapt to challenges as a team. To simplify topics to a specific idea instead of trying to hit everything at once. Keeping an open scope instead of narrowing into one niche topic.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Perfect Weather - In the future, this would be implemented directly into the AccuWeather app to plan for events based on weather, implemented into voice assistants for info on what the weather would be when planning a specific date and time, and implementing directly into calendar apps such as Google Calendars to show the weather directly when you are selecting a date and time.
