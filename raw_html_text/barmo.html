                    Have you ever been to the bars and left your card or ran out of cash and didn't want to pay absurd atm fees? Have you ever paid your bill at a restaurant and then decided you wanted to order one more appetizer or that dessert? If so, Barmo is the app for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two versions of Barmo, one for the merchant and one for the customer.  The merchant has the ability to send a bill to a customer, update a customer's bill (similar to updating a tab), and delete a bill (if they make a mistake in the creation).  They also have the ability to view all current and past transactions as well as their info. For the customer, they have the ability to view their bills, add a tip, and pay their bills.  In the current implementation, you need to put in the id for the customer and the purchases in order to modify and use them.  In an actual application implementation, the merchant would be able to scan a customer's phone which would have a qr code or select a purchase from a list of all the purchases available.  The customer would also be able to select which purchases they want to modify and add a tip to with ease using a built in gui in the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as future plans go, there are a wide variety of implementations this can apply to.  For example, this can be used to precharge people for a cover charge, make reservations, split bills, or used to simply pay at an retailer.  This is more convenient than using apple pay or any touch pay system because as weird as it may be, people think they look weird touching a phone up to a scanner.  This allows them to easily just send some money with the press of a button.  Also, similar to venmo, it would allow for p2p transactions which would allow them to maintain a running balance.  With that in mind, they would be able to pay for things without having to ever transfer their money out of venmo, one of the biggest complaints we have heard for the app.
