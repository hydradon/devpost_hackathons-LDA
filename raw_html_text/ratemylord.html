                    The process of moving out into student housing/residence entails of a lot of responsibility. Most students do not know their landlords from before and therefore, they are always worried about their safety in their new home.

                    Our webapp, RateMyLord, allows students to post reviews on the rental property they have previously lived on. Students can rate the landlord in terms of Responsiveness, Cleanliness, Facilities, and also add additional notes.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Firebase (coded using JavaScript) to store data in the cloud. Simple HTML+CSS for front-end design.
