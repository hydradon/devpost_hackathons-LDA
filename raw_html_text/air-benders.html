                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are lonely. Especially on planes. Some people get really annoyed by others on planes.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seats people around others who they are likely to be comfortable around. By assessing your situation (Flight Class, gender, age) and your wants (talking to people/sleeping, window/aisle seat), our app suggests others on the flight with whom you are more likely to enjoy the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the American Airlines API, we built our Android app with Android Studio, MongoDB, and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the API was quite a challenge. We ran into countless roadblocks in terms of allowing certain permissions and fixing hard-to-notice syntax errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished our first sprint. While we had planned four, finishing any sprint at all was our true goal (which we accomplished).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get good at android studio. MongoDB isn't as intimidating is people think it is. Java is annoying.
                </p>
