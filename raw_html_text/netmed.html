                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with the idea of bringing organization and efficiency to our school's scheduling system. This would allow us to reach teachers easily and quickly. However, we decided to turn this toward the medical field. The medical field would benefit from the organization and efficiency that we envisioned for the school's scheduling system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to manage appointments with local doctors. Once registered, one can see a list of doctors with their field of expertise, their charge per minute, and their location, which brings you to Google Maps with the location of the said doctor. If you click on a doctor, you will be brought to that doctor's contact page. You will be able to see their location and try to create an appointment with them. If successful, one will be able to see a list of appointments in the appointments page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with an ASP.NET back-end combined with some jQuery and Bootstrap front-end. We used codeanywhere.com to collaborate on the project in real-time. We used ftp to connect to our website to see the actual result that people would see. We had a TODO list and we communicated to the rest of the team which task we were taking on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had various challenges. For example, we ran into some ASP.NET compatibility problems with our front-end. Another example was when we had to write our own algorithms whether they be for sorting through tables or testing for time concurrencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully made a login system which keeps track of your appointments with doctors. We also were successful at implementing the Google Maps API to get the doctors near your location and display their location on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each learned a new skill in front-end or back-end, and experienced the other side of the web development process. For the front-end developers, we got our first taste of ASP.NET. For the back-end developer, he improved his front-end skills, mainly his javascript and jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NetMed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement an expandable list of doctors. We would also ask for the user's location to find the doctors around their area. We would allow doctors to communicate with patients with notifications and use reminders to notify patients and doctors of upcoming appointments.
