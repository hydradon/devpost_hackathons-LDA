                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a tool to quickly deploy a web server for testing purposes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates an ssh tunnel between the user's computer to the server which, hosts the port to anyone with an internet connection
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wasted 16h on a Rust implementation to then give up and switch to Node.js a more usual approach
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rust type safety and really strict compiler can be a huge time consumer. Due to all the time wasted on Rust, I was unable to finish the full project but we did manage to achieve a usable stage.
