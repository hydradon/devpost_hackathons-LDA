                    If you love photography as much as I do (hint: you don't), you know that drone photography is cool and sexy but also expensive, cumbersome, and still very rudimentary. In addition, every photographer knows that the best camera is the one that's with you, and normal people don't ordinarily lug around heavy, bulk, multi-thousand dollar drone gear.

                    FlyFoto makes drone photography simple and easy: simply load the app, don the case, and toss your phone in the air. When your phone reaches the peak of its flight, the app automatically takes a picture! FlyFoto uses advanced dynamic control algorithms to stabilize your phone automatically, ensuring that the phone is facing straight down while eliminating motion blur.
