                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has always been interested in Virtual Reality and with the idea of building a virtual space where anything is possible. We've always wanted to use VR technology to perform tasks that cannot be done normally or affordably in real life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AutoVision is a VR simulated multiplayer driving game where the user must follow road rules to the finish line. Immersed in a full time driving environment, the user must keep track of the speed limit, speed bumps, traffic lights, and other cars as they make their way to the finish line. In the end, demerit points are summed up to determine what the user violated so they can gain experience and knowledge, which is crucial when learning how to drive for the first time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game by integrating the game engine Unity and the Oculus Rift to provide an immersive experience. We programmed both the server and client side in C# so that multiple people can play at once. The Oculus Rift is used to provide graphics and real life visuals to make the simulation as realistic as possible. Additionally, 3D models were created on Cinema 4D.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was the integration of Unity and the Oculus Rift. One of the remotes was not taking input at all, which wasted a lot of time. Fortunately, we switched to keyboard which eased a lot of the compatibility issues between two completely different pieces of hardware.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment we're most proud of is the 3D aspect of this project since this is one of our first 3D project with a headset. We've created other 3D games before but once you integrate it with something like Oculus Rift, the experience becomes 100 times better.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we feel we learnt most in this project is how to resolve problems. Through this project, we've made many smart and efficient decisions that saved us a lot of time. For example, compartmentalizing the tasks allowed everyone to have a role and to be always active during the hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What's next for AutoVision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for AutoVision is incorporating more features into the game. For example, putting on a seat belt or signalling for lane shifts. Additionally, we will push to have AutoVision to be incorporated into driving schools in order to be more recognized and trusted.
