                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent floods and drought like situation in California caught our attention to the fact that almost 80% of water therein is spent on irrigating farms. This made us think of the need for a better irrigation management system. And so Swagria was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IrriGator provides farmers with a dashboard detailing the map of the farm they own and dividing them into zones based on crop type, water required for irrigation and so on. We used John Deere's Management Zones and Field Connect dataset to come up with an algorithm that determines which zone requires more attention by the farmer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Google maps to display the farm lands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                    No time. Made it all in about less than 2 hours.
