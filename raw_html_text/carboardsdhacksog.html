                    We were just four guys who ended up sitting on the same table and thus building the greatest hackathon team in the world. haha jk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all are just four UCSD undergrads who didnt know each other before this but leave very happy with who we got as teammates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rotating our code assignments , making sure that we never got stuck, constantly communicating are the qualities for a great team and we all are definetly proud of ourselves and each other for working through all the struggles as a team.

                <p>
                    We just wanted to have fun. could not get an oculus rift so we built a VR game on cardboard. Its a hackathon after all. 
Our aim was to make a cool but old school VR game that would get you nostalgic.

                <p>
                    Just hours scripting on Unity. Building our environments constantly. Iterating through our process.
