                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by what we had for lunch, PIZZA!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game that lets you play as a pizza pie trying to fight for your life against your famished and crazy creator, The Chef
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Unity and C#, and we made our assets with Piskelapp.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into bullets not colliding with other objects, most of our group had not used unity before. We were mostly learning the platform as we went. Drawing all the sprites took some time. We were not able to polish the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that what we were able to finish our project within the time limit, finished with less than an hour remaining. I'm also proud that we were able to overcome the challenged of staying up all night to be able to finish on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that some of the most seemingly impossible problems can be solved with the simplest solutions, like how we spent an hour wondering why our bullets weren't interacting with each other, only to find out we had a tiny overlapping colliders between our projectiles and what was spawning then.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PizzaBoii
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add different abilities for our pizza boi based on which topping is selected at the start. For example, jalapenos will turn your attack into a short-ranged flame thrower, while a topping of olives will turn your attack into a  "minigun" that rapidly shoots small olives. We also want to add different difficulty settings for our Chef.
