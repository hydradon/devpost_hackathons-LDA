                    It&rsquo;s a sunny Thursday in Aarhus. Charlotte has a busy weekend ahead of her, where a business meeting Friday and a cocktail party Saturday, will push Charlotte&rsquo;s wardrobe to the limit. Back in 2017 she would have skimmed the internet for new clothes and headed straight to the shopping center. But today is different. Charlotte throws her legs up on the couch, and grabs her tablet. A short call on skype presents her with Viki, a sales representative from her favorite clothes store. Charlotte and Viki talk like they&rsquo;ve known each other for years &ndash; Well it&rsquo;s only been two weeks since their last talk. Charlotte tells Viki about her upcoming weekend, and Viki finds some outfits, that matches those Charlotte bought the last time. Charlotte rejects a couple of outfits immediately. Viki recommends one outfit especially, for being the next new &ldquo;wow&rdquo;. Charlotte is very impressed by Viki&rsquo;s recommendation, and after just five minutes, Charlotte has decided on the outfit she wants to try, and Viki sends her details and pictures. Charlotte toggles to a browser window and searches online for reviews and prices for the outfit, and finds that Viki again has the lowest prices.
As Charlotte enters the store, she is met by another sales associate that greets her by her name, and walks Charlotte to a dressing room, where her outfit is already laid out. The sales associate has included some shoes and a cocktaildress for Charlotte to try. Charlotte finds the shoes adorable so she scans them into her barcodescanner, which goes online, and finds the shoes 200 kroners cheaper at another store. Charlotte tells this to the sales associate, who quickly gives Charlotte the shoes at the lower price. Charlotte tries on the dress, but she can&rsquo;t decide. She sends a video to her top fashion friends, who quickly sends a negative response back. The dress goes back on the hanger. Charlotte checks out with her smartphone, and as she is about to leave, a life size screen shows her a perfect bikini top for the summer. She scans the order code, and smiles as she leaves the store &ndash; Knowing her new bikini will be in the mail tomorrow.
A recent study made by Baand and Andersen (2017), shows that 95 percent of shoppers, has price as their most important criteria, when shopping in a physical store. This means that, although 58 percent wants a pleasant experience and 42 percent appreciates the personal service, the physical stores, still should make hard decisions when trying to attract customers. Some researchers have suggested that a more intense focus on the loyal customers, with approaches like loyalty discounts, would be a much more valuable direction, because the regular customers bring their friends to the store.
Apparently, sustainability isn&rsquo;t as appreciated in the Danish community yet, where 0 percent of the respondents (Baand, Andersen 2017), had this as one of the important criteria for shopping in a physical store.
So, what focus should the retailers keep in the upcoming years? According to the study (Baand, Andersen 2017), one main area is worth digging into, which is the option for seeing the clothes at home on a digital platform, and trying and buying in store. This proves that people still like the physical option of the feel and touch of the clothes before buying. 
A minor, but still interesting focus for the future, could be the possibility for the customer to rent an outfit. 26 percent of respondents (Baand, Andersen 2017), chose this as one of their &ldquo;want-to have&rdquo; options for future reasons to visit a physical store. Another option which gained the same backing, is the option to have a monthly subscription, where customers gain access to borrowing two or more outfits.
At a more personal customer level, 26 percent also meant that it is important for them, in the future, that the shop assistants know a specific users style on forehand.
