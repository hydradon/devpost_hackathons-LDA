                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make something cool with the Pebble and Police data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a user's location and passes that to the Police.uk data API. That then returns a set of data about recent crimes in the area. This is displayed to the user in a variety of ways. For instance, you are able to see how many crimes, the type of crimes and their frequency and the exact spot that most of the crimes occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally users can shake the pebble to refetch data and can set the app to automatically update every 20mins if they are walking around and want regular updates.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the CloudPebble IDE and PebbleJS API (plus GitHub ofc).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript....
The Pebble API is lacking when developing in JS as this functionality has only been recently added.  Understanding the documentation (PebbleJS != PebbleKit JS). CloudPebble IDE can be slow to work with. Pebble has a limited screen and button inputs.

                    It runs. First time working with a lot of tech e.g. the Pebble, JSON, JavaScript (for Charlie).

                    JavaScript is a strange language. However it was something we had not really used before so it was good to learn it. Esp using API to get data and JSON/AJAX stuff.
