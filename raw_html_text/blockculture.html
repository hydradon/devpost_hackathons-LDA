                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was my grandpa, he does farming in India and I was thinking about him when I was choosing my idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It basically is insurance for farmers using digital coins, helps farmers predict droughts and sell crops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn&rsquo;t build anything yet but what imagine it to be is an app on your phone or a website. That has all the features of a betting system, a way to convert cryptocurrency and a way to sell your crops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn&rsquo;t have a teammate to support me, and my idea was rough and I had to refine it to make sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole idea of a cryptocurrency that acts like insurance for farmers I really feel proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of blockchain and how cryptocurrency is formed. I also learned how things like bitcoin operate and how it could be hacked and ways to prevent it.
                </p>

                    What's next for BlockCulture
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talk to farmers see if they are interested, start an app or website, create the currency, talk to potential Buisness partners, start selling the idea to farmers around the world.
