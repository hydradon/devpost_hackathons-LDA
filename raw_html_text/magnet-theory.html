                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adopting a minimalistic-based aesthetic, Magnet Theory is built with the same foundation. Clean and straightforward experience focusing heavily on the gameplay part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Offering a wide selection of challenges, Magnet Theory tests the player's ability to come up with solutions for the difficult physics-based problems. Using clever approaches is always rewarding and the levels are unique.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with HTML5/JS/Cordova to achieve cross-platform goals (Web browsers/Mobile devices)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Due to limited resources, planning &amp; executing a marketing plan was very difficult since what we could do was tightly bound by our funds.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game has been played by tens of thousands of players many which showed very positive reactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a successful game is difficult, it's as simple as that. Polishing, testing and improving constantly is what allows a game to shine. It became clear why the quote "A delayed game is eventually good, a rushed game is always bad" is always repeated in the industry
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Magnet Theory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the arrival of several level packs currently in making, It will be pushed on distribution channels after localization for more markets.
