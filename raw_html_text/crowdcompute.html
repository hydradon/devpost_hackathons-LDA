                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were on a plane and we were wondering what could we do with these devices in our hands
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .Many people in this world have phones that they are not using at this moment in time. A large subset of these people want money. Our hack crowdsources computational power taking advantage of the increasingly fast growth in smart phone processors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Training a machine learning model takes a great deal of power to do and can take a long time when using only one machine. With our platform, the task is parallelized and distributed among multitudes of mobile devices.
