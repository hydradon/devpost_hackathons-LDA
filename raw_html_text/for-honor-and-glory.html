                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always wanted to make our own game that had an in depth store and was related to our interests. We knew we could build a simply version of this idea in visual basic 6.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a program that is a texted based story game that uses randomly generated events, the users choices, and a changing statistic system that allows the user to become any person they want while going on their quest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in VB6 and just use a variety of knowledge that we have learned in our computer programming classes from school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed someway to display all of the random events that happen within the story line of the game, so we had to decide how we could do this. We decided to just use a lot of forms to accomplish this but there was probably better ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a game that goes from start to finish with few errors. We created something that we were interested in and we are content with the outcome of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine our interests into what we have learned about computer programming(which is not very much to be honest) but you can pretty much do anything if you have the discipline to learn and work with ll of the factor is your environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for For Honor and Glory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more detail to the game and make the choice have a bigger impact on the outcome. We also envisioned multiple story lines based on which faction you choose to follow at the beginning of the program and would like to create those optional stories with more detail and elements.
