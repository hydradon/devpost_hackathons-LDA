                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In low resource healthcare settings, there is a lack of nurses to deal with the number of patients who need effective postoperative care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Samsung galaxy gear active2 to monitor BP, HR, SpO2 &rarr; notify the nurse when the patient is undergoing a decline in status/in a danger zone
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Place watch on patient post-op
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will get an average of how the patient&rsquo;s vitals look like post-op
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will ping the nurse when the vitals drop below their expected ranges
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the schematic for HEALTHbits during our time but were not able to create the program used for it.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time to program/complete the code for the schematic of HEALTHbits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a well-developed outline of a solution to a post-operative common problem. Also, we effectively utilized our diverse skillsets in order to reduce our project into components and to create individual pieces that eventually fit together seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it seems like a simple task, technology to determine blood pressure has not advanced very far from the manual and automated blood pressure cuff. However, there are technologies being piloted. We learned the fundamentals of website building using html and how to organize our project in order to complete what was possible within our given time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HEALTHbits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on the projected practicality and usefulness of our idea, we will move further to pilot the software needed to allow HEALTHbits to function optimally.
