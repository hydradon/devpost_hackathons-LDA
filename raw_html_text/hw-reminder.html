                    We live in a community where people lack access to technology.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attend Castlemont High School in East Oakland. Only 40% of Oakland's students have computers and Internet at home, even fewer at our school. Everyone has a phone, though. Homework is rarely completed. Students forget what work they have with their busy and stressful lives; how can you remember when you have home, school, and work responsibilities? We know our most affluent peers benefit from tools on the Internet to help them manage their schedules and to learn. We want the same advantages, but recognize that not all of our classmates have computer access at home. To solve this problem, we're using text messages!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    HW Helper reminds students about their works and utilizes a peer network.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every night, students will receive a text message reminder to check whether or not they've completed their homework. If they have, they have the option to put themselves in a queue to help their peers. If they haven't because they're confused, they can connect with a peer who is able and willing to help them. If they just haven't had the time yet, they can decline the help, but they'll get another reminder in an hour.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    This app uses node.js and Twilio.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also used Heruko and Google Hangouts along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    It wasn't always smooth sailing.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a while to recognize the environment variables that were needed to activate Twilio. We also had to complete tutorials on Heroku. Once we got the sending and receiving of messages down, the rest of the project was more straight forward. Special shout-out to Eddie at the Twilio table: you're the real MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We are proud that this technology could be used by our teachers starting Monday.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ... and our guess is that they probably will. Some teachers send us email with the understanding that many of their students won't receive it until the morning. If they could send a text, especially one that put the help burden on other students - and not themselves - we know they'd be interested.
                </p>

                    Git, node.js, Twilio, environment variables, waiting in lines, and that people here dance...

                    We plan to build out features that will allow for students to make subject-specific connections and to build in analytics.
