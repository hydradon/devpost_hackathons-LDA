                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all been baited at least once into clicking a video that doesn't deliver to your expectations. Clickbait is becoming a more and more pressing issue as the means of making an income online in this day and age is on the rise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClikChek is a simple web application (future chrome extension) that uses Machine Learning to predict how likely a given video will be clickbait.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for the frontend. As for the back end we used Google's cloud video intelligence api and Machine Learning to analyse the given video and make predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time working with api's, it took some getting used to the way they are implemented. Also, due to time constraints we were unable to fully train our Machine Learning model to make accurate predictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    Successfully implementing an api.
