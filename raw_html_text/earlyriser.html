                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend was having a difficult time organizing his information for the day. Wanted to offer a quick solution to help him set
                    <strong>
                        HIS LIFE RIGHT
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app logs you into a space that contains cards of information about your day. At the top, we have a digital clock that shows you when the next alarm will go off. Below that, we have a schedule that lists what events you have during the day in chronological order. Next, the reminders list provides a list of items to get done during the day. Lastly, the outfit tab shows allows you to plan what you want to wear for the day. In the bottom right corner, we have a general purpose addition button that allows you to add alarms, calendar dates, reminders, and outfits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and more than a few tears. But through that, we used Adobe XD to map out a (very) basic prototype. Next we used Android Studio and Java to program the functionality of buttons. We used XML to map out the buttons and add true functionality to our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On this project, we all learned how to use GitHub, Android Studio, and Adobe XD. There were challenges in communication, many of us were doing this for the first or second time, and had to learn how others worked in group settings. Another big challenge was converting such a specific vision into code and functionality. It was very different than the problems we normally get in our coding classes.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our Adobe XD UI design and prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that app building is a HUGE process that requires constant communication, and patience. UI design is more difficult that we thought. Many default dependencies are used for testing an are unnecessary and can contribute to version conflicts with other dependencies.

                <h2>
                    What's next for EarlyRiser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work on the ability to customize our app. We are also learning how to use apis to integrate services (like Google Maps) into our product. We are planning a navigation overhaul, that presents all info as a continuous scroll as opposed to buttons. As a group, we have decided that EarlyRiser will remain in active development after this Hackathon. Check us out on Soundcloud, link in bio!
