                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an open competition online, and we found it very interesting and challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it wants
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are asked to derive an efficient and effective algorithm to find out most potential advertisement retargeting customers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through data analysis, feature extraction, model derivations, and robust experiments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered huge user-item networks, and it is hard to address such a big dataset. In the beginning, we didn't know how to improve our model performance. Besides, there are lots of tricky points in dealing with the dataset preprocessing and model building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started everything from scratches; however, we at the end derived a novel algorithm with great performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to run through complete machine learning framework in merely thirty-six hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for Conversion Probability Prediction in Retargeting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Invest more time in feature creations and model derivations to improve our mode performance.
