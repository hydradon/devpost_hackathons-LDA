                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group members, Andrew, is an aspiring actor and he had the idea to create something that could help him remember lines easier, better and more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project records the user and the user is able to play back their audio as it saves to their desktop. They can record for however they want and they can share the audio with other actors/actresses if they choose. Users can use this app to critique their voices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python and python packages. The packages we used were tkinter, pyaudio , and wave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge we ran into was coming up with an idea to start the project. Another challenge was trying to save the audio file onto the user's desktop and having the user able to name it whatever they wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coming up with this idea as we think we can improve this idea more if we had time. We are also proud of working together and sharing the workload.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coming together as a team made this project fun instead of stressful. We are proud of learning off of each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recording to remember
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we could try to incorporate a video so that the users can see how they look and sound when they are running through their lines. They could also upload the videos to have other developing actors/actresses critique them. Users would be able to add notes and blockings to their scripts.
