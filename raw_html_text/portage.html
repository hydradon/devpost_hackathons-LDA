                <p>
                    Portage was created to make and maintain virtual business cards on the web. Users are able to keep personal social media links as a virtual business card or store other user's business cards with a scan of a QR code.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team did not have prior experience working with React js or implementing AWS serverless technologies.

                    Understanding the app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think of the countless times you'd meet new people and want to add them on multiple social media; it's simply inefficient and inconvenient for both parties! With Portage, users can customize their own "cards" with whatever social media they own accounts on and share them (the cards) with their new friends by simply scanning their QR code. Users can collect and create multiple cards to suit different occasions that may be more business or work-related. The cards can be scanned and connected offline as well.
