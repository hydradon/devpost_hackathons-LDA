                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given, that I am an ardent Wegman fanatic who loves dining at their restaurants, what engages me more? We heard about their new API that lets developers use their data for market analysis and research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It' an interactive system which utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API for meal/dish recognition.The output which is the name of the item given as an image input by the user is used to retrieve the similar dish available in the Wegman's API.After obtaining all the details of the meal from the recipes API, the relative details such as the ingredients used, wellness factor and description are displayed to the user.The relevant products are subsequently used to retrieve the best price of the product and also based on the current location of the user the details of the nearby store is also displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Computer Vision API to detect the kind of food from the image and match the best with the Wegman's product API data. We designed functions to match similar keywords from the Google Computer Vision API with the Wegman's products data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating with the maps and determining the exact locations was difficult.

                <p>
                    We took up this challenge as our second project submission and we were able to do all these analysis within 6 hours.
