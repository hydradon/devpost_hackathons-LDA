                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was the image of archaeologists discovering artifacts in situ and how we could allow players to search for objects and strive to understand them, like professional archaeologists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to navigate the site of Khirbat en- Nahas, and discover different artifacts that show the different aspects of copper production in simulated locations based on our extensive research. This project also strives to deliver a narrative about the organization of the site, and how the presence of industrial copper sites during the 10th century hinted at a strong power base in the region, like Solomon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity version 5.5 and we used the scene editor to map an aerial photo of the site to a 2D terrain and reconstructed the geography and site buildings of Area A in Khirbat en-Nahas. We downloaded Oculus Utilities to implement game-play functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was time management. There was so much more we wanted to add to our project such as, adding extra artifacts, making an archaeology tent as a home-base for the player, and increasing the scope of our archaeological site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we self-taught ourselves Unity without any prior experience with the system. We are also content with how we incorporated our strengths and abilities in order to accomplish this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the ancient organization processes of Khirbat en-Nahas, and how the production of copper, although it may seem menial, was actually very important in understanding how complex societies develop, evolve, and interact with each other.
                </p>
