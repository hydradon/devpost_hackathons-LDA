                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is joined together from across the United States (Florida to California). In the spirits of the Beach Hacks we wanted to come up with a unique idea that would hack the beach and tackle multiple challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LifeGuard will enable lifeguards to do their jobs smarter and faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LifeGuard uses the stream deck to provide lifeguards with an efficient and easy way to understand what's currently going on and what will be coming to the beach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The steam deck provides the following features with the ease of a click:

                    <li>
                        Instant 911 and help distress calls: Used twilio to automate text message when an emergency is detected. Also integrated snapchat bitmoji kit to identify and send message other life guards.

                    <li>
                        Provides current wave status: Used machine learning (openCV) to teach our program what calm waves looked like. The analysis done is stored in the google cloud

                    <li>
                        Current weather conditions: Set-up a Arduino Mega with four sensors (UV, gas, dust, and humidity) to simulate data of current conditions to help determine the current weather conditions.

                        Stream deck was challenging to program natively, but it was a fun challenge.

                    <li>
                        Since this was my first hack-a-thon I learned that these events are about learning and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.
