                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally inspired by trying to see how many objects would fit inside of containers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cubes VR lets you create and play with blocks, it feels like building with real blocks. You can stack blocks, make wall shapes, knock down your towers and see the blocks scatter. It's really cool to see.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the graphics engine Unreal Engine to make it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really hard to get started. None of us have worked with VR before, or even used Unreal Engine! That said, we were able to keep our chins up and work through it; it was a fantastic experience and we're very excited to continue working with virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get creating the blocks working. It required several iterations to get them to spawn properly in hand. The other we're really pleased with it how genuinely fun the program turned out to be. We were a little skeptical at first but when we started playing with it we found it was a really cool experience.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton! It was two of our member's first hackathon, and it was the other member's second so there was a lot of new stuff for all of us to experience. We learned a lot about planning in the session on friday night, using an incremental plan.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cubes VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We next want to add more traditional block shapes like rectangles and archways.
