                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, the 'learn how to read' apps we've had experience with have been badly put together and have no real effect. That's why we created Pictobaby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pictobaby uses Play-Doh to teach kids how to read. Learn more on our website.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It wasn't built as the team needed to leave early.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not building it.

                <p>
                    Hopefully an actual game.

                    IT IS ACTUALLY pictobaby.tech BUT DEVPOST DOESN'T RECOGNIZE IT AS AN ACTUAL LINK.
