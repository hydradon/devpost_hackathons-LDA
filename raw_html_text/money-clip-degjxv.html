                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with the (beautifully-documented) Capital One Nessie API and capitalize on the (simulated) data it provides to make an app that would help users better understand their spending habits. Our idea was that the app could preemptively curb spending by reminding users of their budget/tendency to spend more in a given area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a prototype of an app that locates users and tells them how much money they spent the last time (day) they were in the (500 m) area (depicted on the map). It also reminds them of how much they allocated for their monthly budget and how much money is left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Usage Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Run by opening Nessie-iOS-Wrapper.xcworkspace in Xcode and running "money clip" in the simulator. Setting the simulator's location (Debug &gt; Location &gt; Custom Location...) to latitude: 42.373208, longitude: -71.119428 makes the simulator seem to be in Harvard Square, near where our Capital One purchase data is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Capital One's Nessie API and Firebase to make our Swift project in the Xcode developing environment. The app pushes and pulls spending data from Capital One's API and uses Firebase to store the users information (login and budget).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use Xcode, and setting up Nessie and Firebase were difficult. The short time period also limited what we were able to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of getting our app to compile. Also, getting both APIs to work was a challenging obstacle that was really satisfying to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with the Capital One and Firebase APIs and CocoaPods. We also learned how to work with asynchronous pulling of data from the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for money clip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had had more time, we would have finished implementing the Firebase account sign-up/authentication and stored more individual user data (beyond budget) in Firebase. Also, we would make more details about the users' previous purchases available so that they could make more informed decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main things we wanted to do with our app was have it give push notifications to users, even when the app was closed. However, neither of us have an Apple Developer's account, so we could not implement that feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, it would be great to actually implement such an app (with other features as well) so as to increase people's awareness of their spending habits.
