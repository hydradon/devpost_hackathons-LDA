                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are cool, and this seemed like a controller with a lot of potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where the player can only hear audio cues coming from the real life glasses, and has to turn himself in the direction of the angry projectiles to defend himself and his glasses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the Bose SDK in Unity, a lot of effort, and with the voicelines of fellow Hackers who voiced the incoming projectiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It deleted and crashed itself twice :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished our first Hackathon and actually did a project!!! It was also really fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technologically speaking, we learned how to implement audio into Unity, inter-personally, we learned who each of us are since we didn't know each other before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bose glasses game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the graphics further. At first we were going to make the game screen completely dark, but some of the people we tested this on said that that was too hard so we left in the primitive graphics for the sake of those c̶h̶e̶a̶t̶e̶r̶s̶ individuals.
