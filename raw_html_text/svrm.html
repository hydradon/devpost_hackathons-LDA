                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sustainability is increasingly becoming an important/vital factor in our daily lives and sustainable movements, technologies and lifestyles will define this decade. The Sustainability Vertical at HackSC appealed to us as there is so much of innovation happening in this field and so many tools in technology and computer science that can be leveraged to bring sustainability to the masses.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SVRM is a web-based social platform that incentivizes users to perform acts of sustainability in exchange for points which can be redeemed for various perks or shown off through the app. Users submit a video of themselves performing a sustainable act (Eg. picking up trash, biking to a destination) and the platform relies on users around the globe to authenticate these acts in a peer-review fashion where reviewers upvote or downvote an act. A map displaying the Enough upvotes earn the user who made the submission points and reviewers are also rewarded a smaller amount of points for their efforts. Another aspect of the platform allows users to voluntarily submit their google maps location history for a particular month which is analyzed on their device and can earn them points for activities such as BIKING, taking the BUS, or WALKING, etc.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built to operate in a distributed fashion. Its frontend is entirely programmed in React using the
                    <em>
                        webpack
                    </em>
                    framework to achieve a multi-page application. The backend is hosted on Google's Firebase, utilizing the Firebase Real Time Database to securely contain user information as well as perform other analytical operations. We used Mux's APIs to upload and utilize the videos that our users will take. We used Google Maps APIs to visualize the Reviewer dashboard which is annotated with videos that a reviewer can play within the application while browsing the map.
