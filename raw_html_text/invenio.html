                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that uses Blockchain. We also wanted to help students and others who need to do research, but need help finding credible sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Invenio is meant to allow the user to find credible research papers written by other people. Users also submit their own papers for peer review. The credibility system is based on a rating by other users and the credibility of those users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team of people on front end working with Bootstrap and a team on back end working with Solidity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with two teams of three members doing different ideas and then ended up with one team of four people after two people left the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the new skills that we learned and hope to develop them farther in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making Invenio was like a crash course in Bootstrap for all of us, especially for the beginners, who got to learn some essential HTML and CSS skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Invenio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make the website more functional and improve the look of the UI.
