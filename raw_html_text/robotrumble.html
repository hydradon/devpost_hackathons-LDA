You can take part of RobotRumble as (1) robot driver, (2) spectator, (3) gambler, or (4) entropy producer e.g. Tweet

                <p>
                    (1) As a robot driver you can take control of one the robots by purchasing your seat as a driver. Additionally choosing to bet on yourself
(2) As an spectator you can watch the live streamed race, and also play the role of entropy producer
(3) As a better, you can bet on your favorite robot/driver, and also play the role of entropy producer
(4) As an entropy producer
 --- You can Tweet (on Twitter) and take over control of a destroyer robot mean to interfere in the races
 --- You can boost the speed of your favorite robots (

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (1) We put together a set of
                    <strong>
                        open-source robots
                    </strong>
                    (Kobuki, Turtlebot) that are controlled by smart contracts and teleoperation through a web-based dapp.
(2) The smart contracts were developed on Solidity and deployed into
                    <strong>
                        ThunderCore Mainnet
                    </strong>
                    (3) We used random number generator oracle from
                    <strong>
                        ChainLink
                    </strong>
                    because
                    <strong>
                        our game combines entropy with strategy
                    </strong>
                    (4) And our identity provider and wallet was
                    <strong>
                        Portis.io
                    </strong>
                    - a product we discovered at ETHDenver.
(5) We implemented the robot control algorithms, and designed a the incentive mechanism and collusion resistant protocols of the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware is hard
Integrating alpha/beta stage blockchain technologies 
Dealing with the limits of decentralization, and of decentralized technologies
Hardware is hard, developing reliable software for robots can get intricate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of that this is a production-ready MVP
We are proud that our Dapp is on a Mainnet
We are proud that our smart contracts implement full-fledge interactions 
We are proud for even have done this project and having lots of fun - it wasn't easy
We are proud to we kept our promise to work together on robots on our next hackathon
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything. Literally.
We are proud of the pain, the suffering,  and the tears
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain transaction time is important for an interactive experience
SIdechain / interchain communication is difficult
Current blockchain products lack a seamless interactions
Don't forget again to your own router (BYOR) when working with robots at a hackathon (an a wifi-extender)

                <h2>
                    What's next for RobotRumble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (1) Full integration into AR/VR
(2) Fully deploy on other mainnets. 
(3) Develop are back at our robotics lab. 
(4) Integrate our other robots, including our humanoid robots. 
(5) Improve incentives model. 
(6) Improve UI/UX.
