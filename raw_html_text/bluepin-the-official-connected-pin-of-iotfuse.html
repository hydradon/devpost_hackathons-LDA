                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wearables are an emerging, massively growing area within technology today.  The challenge is creating aesthetically pleasing yet having a high-value function.  Rama Prasad is working on connected wearable devices as a startup, and this is a foray into investigating some of fascinating new form factor possibilities.

                    Pins are traditionally worn to show one's affiliation for a group - typically it can be geographical, sports-related, organizational or even nationalistic.  In this case, we're a bunch of IoT geeks here in Minnesota, and we want to celebrate and recognize the tech community that we love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now, we are thinking that the functionality will be the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is a pin which has hands-free connection to a smartphone, which alerts the user with music that is played from songs stored on the phone.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That being said, this is a work in process - please check back here for more updates and please give us your feedback as we investigate what we want this thing to do.  The smartphone is a massive ecosystem - so it's a question of what appeals to people in IoTFuse.
                </p>

                        Bluebean is less than a quarter size, it can fit behind a button pin.

                        First iteration we will use a non-rechargeable battery, but in the future we will look at smaller rechargeable batteries.

                    <li>
                        We will print off custom pins which have, "IoTFuse," logo on it.
