                        What Inspired Us?

                <p>
                    We were inspired by the capabilities of Twilio's communication API. Using this tool, we were motivated to solve a simple problem that is reoccurring in all sorts of social gatherings involving music.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        What problem did we solve?
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognized a problem within parties or social gatherings. When multiple people try and request a song, the process becomes quite inefficient. The guests requesting each song have to search for the host who is controlling the playlist/connected to the speaker, and the host then has to look up each song request on his/her personal device, and add it to the queue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <strong>
                        How it works
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to utilize Twilio's API to be able to allow people to send a text to a Twilio number in order to search through Spotify using Spotify's API, and add the respective song to an existing playlist. This allows everyone to request music easily and efficiently, without much effort!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <strong>
                        Problems we encountered
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning and utilizing the Spotipy API was challenging for us at first.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        What we learned?
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were faced with many challenges combined with increasing fatigue, however, persevering and working together, we were able to overcome any challenges and create a very useful and fun service for Spotify users and party-goers.
