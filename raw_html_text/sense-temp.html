                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members won an arduino so we decided to use it and learn how to interface a temp sensor to the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The arduino uses a temp sensor whose data is picked up by python and sent on to our sql database. The sql database is then updated on our website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of googling and tutorials
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sensor not being installed properly. Mysql not being able to pick up the data it was being sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learning something new for everyone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of the arduino and how we can use it in the internet of things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sense Temp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to build a full web interface that allows you to see the temperature and let you interface and interact with a virtual pet. We also want to include more than just a temperature sensor.
