                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using leap motion, take the roll, pitch, yaw and height of a hand, then use these to choose the colours of strings and output them as you manipulate them.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about node.js, and programming with leap motion.

                    What's next for NodeShite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Look into visual representation of more meaningful data, such as data from muse headsets and using leap motion for other things, such as game controllers.
