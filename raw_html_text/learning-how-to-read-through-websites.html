                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a beginner in computer science, I wanted to learn about working with text files as well as doing something with websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has not been 100% completed but it is supposed to tell the user if a word is in a webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole language was tough for me. Also I had to learn to use an IDE which was hard at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though my program does not work, I survived my first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the different syntax regarding Python which I was unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to make bigger projects as I take computer science courses next year and learn about the things I can do with it.
