                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watching the SIUe sports club grow, we wanted to create a place for that diverse community that is a sort of central hub for all their stats, player information, game results, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using existing statistics &amp; databases, we created a user-friendly platform that displays these parameters of each player in an attractive, simple, and clean format. With Java in conjunction with Selenium, we pulled these databases from reputable websites already in use by the players and took the most outstanding values and records and displayed them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the web interface, we built it using html, PHP, and some CSS. We decorated and made user-friendly attributes to make the website easy to use and also attractive. Using Java and Selenium, we grabbed data from websites in order to present them on our own platform in a user-friendly way, while also contributing multiple statistics from multiple games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One main challenge was figuring out how exactly we wanted to execute this idea. After brainstorming and some thinking, we finally figured out a method to connect the bridge between our data and the web interface we created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amount of teamwork and the learning curve we climbed over is truly a sight to see when looking back at all of our hard work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new ways to exploit the already-learned languages and skills we already had and mold them to tools that could solve our present problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eSDN - eSports Data Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand this to multiple data sources, grab more information, and broaden the focus from just pro players to amateurs to help them find teammates and club members as well as get more exposure. Also, we want to add location parameters to help find players for in my area.
