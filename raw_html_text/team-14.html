                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application serves forms for the National Kidney Foundation of Arizona to support their
many programs. These forms used to be done on paper and then faxed into the foundation.
This program streamlines this process by collecting the data in online forms and automatically
packaging the data into a CSV format that is automatically emailed to the correct person(s).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using HTML forms on HTML pages with a python backend handling the
serving of the pages and the processing of the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges getting python to run and usage of python syntax and classes. We also
ran into trouble using flask. Our biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the data from the
online HTML forms into a nice formatted CSV file.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a working app in such a short period of time that fulfills the
requirements of our nonprofit. We are also proud of the camaraderie between our team members.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mostly learned how to use Flask and Python, which were unfamiliar for many of us. We also
got exposure to some javascript and the building of HTML pages.
