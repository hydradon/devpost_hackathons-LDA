                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team mate and I were faced with the challenge of managing a team of 20 developers working on a large project. We quickly became overwhelmed with the burden of keeping everything running smoothly and meeting deadlines. The project consisted of multiple application segments all coming together to form a large product. This posted a great challenge as resources were limited and specific to each applications segment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After countless approaches, we finally came to the realization that the best and most efficient way to manage the team was to create different boards for each application segment to allocate resources accordingly. This worked for a while, but then the queue of task grew and we found ourselves constantly switching from one board to another and with no big picture of what was going on on the higher level. As a result we were late for many deadlines, and sprint planning meetings were a disaster. We looked for tools to help with our predicament but found nothing that would serve our needs, and this is when we decided to build our own tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early Bird allows you to create views containing multiple boards or projects. It helps visualize how multiple projects come together in your current and future Sprints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Atlassian Connect Express framework, and Angular.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was that we had never built a Jira add-on before. Also, we had challenges with the documentation, as it is repeated and sometimes not very explicit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create this amazing Add-on in a very short time. We are actually using and it has helped us tremendously in our day to day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Jira Connect and about the lifecycle of a cloud add on. Also we learned ways to plan more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Early Bird
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to sell this Add-on on the Atlassian Marketplace and hopefully help others facing the same problems.
