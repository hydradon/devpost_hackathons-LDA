                    <strong>
                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    - A combination of classic and modern materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    - Glows with an subtle accent of orange light. Manually turned on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How I built it
                    </strong>
                    - With a lot of patience, many attempts with different LEDs, and some EL wire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                    - Trying to work with arduino and the provided LED strips with limited hardware. When we didn't have a part we needed, we had to find a different solution. There were also no 12V power sources so some of the LED strips were unusable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </strong>
                    - Made from scratch, the original design, concept, and hardware came together relatively quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What I learned
                    </strong>
                    - The possibilities of microcontrollers and that a lot of different hardware component are required to come together perfectly to produce a final product. If even one of those pieces of hardware fails, so does the project.

                    <strong>
                        What's next for LEDress
                    </strong>
                    - Wearable technology is becoming very prevalent in the fashion industry and hardware including lighting and small motors can be combined to create subtle accents or bold statements.
