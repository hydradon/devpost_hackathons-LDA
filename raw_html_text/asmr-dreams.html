                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a skill that would complement other Alexa Devices. Recently Amazon announced the Echo Loop, Echo Frame and the Echo Buds, which are different from the smart speaker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knew as soon as they announced the Echo Buds, I had to do an ASMR skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is ASMR?
ASMR is a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck, as experienced by some people in response to a specific gentle stimulus, often a particular sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millions of people (including myself) fall asleep to ASMR. To get the full ASMR experience, wearing headphones or earphones is recommend, which is where the Echo Buds come in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Youtube, ASMR videos have millions of views. The only issue I have with viewing ASMR on Youtube, is that you have to keep the screen on or the audio will stop playing, which is annoying in the night. This is why I wanted to bring ASMR to Alexa. With the Echo Buds, the user can just play some ASMR and not have a glaring screen, which should provide a better night's sleep.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ASMR Dreams is an audio skill that plays ASMR. When you open the skill you can decide whether you want to play a particular trigger or a selection.

                <p>
                    With the subscription, subscribers can listen to or loop to more content.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed ASMR Dreams using the ASK-CLI, Alexa SDK, AWS Lambda, S3 Bucket, DynamoDB, Alexa Presentation Language and Node.JS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recorded the audio on Audacity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the content was a bit challenging. I have never done ASMR so this was entirely new to me. With each audio being 20 minutes long, It was hard to go through one recording without some disruption out of my control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ASMR is such an amazing experience. It was very therapeutic creating all the audio. I also made it in Japanese, which I am proud of, as now I have extended it to more users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a great deal about ASMR. It is very popular amongst the public and I am glad I can continue to bring ASMR to Alexa. Developing this skill has made me become even more familiar with the Audio Player.
                </p>

                    Providing more content for subscribers including more audio and more triggers for them to hear.
