                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Came across state of art portable ultrasound device usable on smartphones. We wanted to build a full solution by analyzing the ultrasound images produced by this device and removing the user's need to go to the hospital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes the image captured by the portable ultrasound device and calculates the probability of a cardiac health complication present within the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a machine learning framework called Tensorflow and Python.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time dealing with machine learning, big learning curve, numerous small bugs, had to sample numerous frameworks before settling with Tensorflow. Biggest challenge: not enough data to train algorithm.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the neural net/image classifier working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning.

                    What's next for Lil' Ultrasound
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the accuracy of the algorithm by collecting more data. Expanding the scope of the algorithm to other applicable body parts such as the liver, kidneys, etc.
