                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is the future of voice assistant and we wanted to contribute
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a memory game where Alexa tells you 5 numbers and asks you if you remember
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Webservices, Lambda, Python, Flask and Jinja Template and Yaml files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The the communication relay from echo to the Alexa skill set console to the developer console where we had written our lamda function and then back with a response was difficult because of configuration setting errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is built in a way to address when its called by its name "Alexa".  So something very cool that we did was making Alexa talk back without invoking or calling "Alexa" explicitly once we have submitted response or spoken back. So our system was able to build conversations with Alexa without having to call back by its name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much clear communication between team members make a difference, how valuable version control is and you should always start configuration settings early.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cool Memory Game with Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scale it to industry level where Alexa can remember which conference rooms are booked by whom and which are empty. Or find best resources for a particular jobs based on their qualities and skills.
