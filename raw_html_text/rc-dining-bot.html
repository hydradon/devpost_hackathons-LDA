                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was once a telegram bot called RCMealbot, which was the solution to the problem many Residential College residents faced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not knowing what food there was going to be at the dining hall next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the recent semesters, this great companion slowly broke down, and at this current point of time, became completely unfunctional. Hence, we decided to fix that.

                    Bugs bugs bugs. 
First time working with a telegram bot and a scraping tool meant a lot of time was put into figuring out how things worked.
Not knowing the limitations of MongoDB disrupted a majority of our plans

                    We have a working MVP! With a couple of extra features too.

                    </code>
                    Look into the tools we intend to use more in-depth. Probably also plan some more specific details to ensure the main ideas work out.
