                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When our floor needs a break from homework and studying, we get together and play Bananagrams together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives the players their tiles, and lets them make a crossword, attempting to use all their words.  Once one player builds a complete valid crossword, it gives all the players another tile from the pool of tiles.  Once the pool is empty, the player who first builds a crossword with all their letters win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used tkinter to display each player's board, their tiles, and messages that tell them about the game.  It uses socket to handle the multiplayer aspects of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we were planning on doing a flow keyboard, that uses eyetracking, and we spent several hours on pygaze but we found out it was only compatible with Windows 7.  Combining code using github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a lot of features.  We have a fully functioning game, that scrolls, and checks to make sure the player's board is valid.  It also has functioning multiplayer capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work together in a team.  Multiplayer using sockets.  Some object oriented programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bananagrams
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it a web app.  Finishing a few features.
