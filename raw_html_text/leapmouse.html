                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that the leap motion controllers and we wanted to hack with them. While we were eating dinner, our hands got dirty and we didn't want to touch our mice. We then decided to make a trackpad with the Leap.

                <p>
                    Our product act as trackpad for windows computers.
