                <p>
                    A VR solution that will enable the Maintenance Technician to identify the issue when the sensors sense it, display the readings, show the location and help to apply some fixes that will stop the water lose. Basically, it will give the Maintenance Technician all the required information

                <p>
                    We have created a sample DMA Pipe Network. The user can visit one of the central location and apply the fixes. these fixes is reflected in the physical demo.
