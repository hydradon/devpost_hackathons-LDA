                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an interest in neural networks and have heard of recurrent neural networks being used for stock price prediction.  We then thought that we could try to augment past market data used to train stock prediction RNNs with sentiment data on those stocks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It forecasts stock prices using a time series of stock data that's labelled with sentiments on those stocks at a given time point
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our neural network using Keras, and visualized data outputed from our model on a node.js webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite a few - ranging from setting up our node.js server, obtaining sentiment data, training our neural net - quite a range of things, mainly pertaining to using data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Used Data:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our stock prices, we used Hourly Nasdaq market data for Facebook and Apple.  For our sentiment data, we used sentiment data on theses stocks gathered and kindly provided by (late on a Saturday night) Pierce Crosby of StockTwits
