                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use our knowledge of Hardware Integration and Java to create a fun and useful project that can be adapted to fit as many roles as the user can imagine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    It currently finds a person's face and tracks it by moving servos to keep the detected face in the center of the video's frame.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Currently, the project utilizes an HD Webcam attached to servos that control the camera's X, Y, and Z axis. Using Java's OpenCV library we created a facial recognition program that detects faces and outputs commands to the servos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Communicating between the Arduino and the Camera proved challenging at first but after some experimenting we succeeding in communicating between the two. Java doesn't inherently output serial commands, but the Arduino required serial commands to operate the servos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the motor had some issues with over compensating when it tried to center. We fixed this by adding a buffer room, so the camera wouldn't have to exactly center, (because this would be impossible unless we had motors that could change angles very precisely) but rather center within that buffer space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Once we finally got it working consistently, that was a very proud moment for us, but we also had proud moments leading up to that moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every leap that we made made us excited as we got closer to our goal, but here are the 3 big ones:
                </p>
                <ol>

                        Setting up the motors and passing the input in correctly to follow the user's face.

                    </strong>
                    - Have the computer output via voice, "I've found you!" when a face is detected, and then if a face is not detected after a certain amount of time it would output via voice, "Where'd you go?"

                    </strong>
                    - Have the camera rotate back and forth, searching for a face, and when it finds a face, it would lock on. When the face is lost (if a person moved out of frame too quickly, etc) it would return back into sentry mode.

                    </strong>
                    - We could give the camera the ability to completely rotate 360 degrees, so it wouldn't be limited by the range of motion. We could also add movement so the device could move around like a robot on wheels. It could detect something far away that might've been a face, but it only detected it for a moment, and then roll towards it so it can better detect if it is a face and then follow it!

                        Independence from computer
                    </strong>
                    - We would set it up to run from something that could fit in the box and take it with it. This would work especially well with the movement, and live video stream. With the movement, it wouldn't have to lug around a laptop, and with the live video stream, you would still be able to access it.
