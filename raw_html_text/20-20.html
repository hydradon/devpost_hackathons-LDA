                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frame fitting can be done via machine learning. Why not measure visual acuity through technology?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our algorithm and input analysis, we can determine the visual acuity of an individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, JS, R-Studio, CSS, and Firebase to create a website where users can use their phone as controllers to input sequences of characters that can be used to identify their visual acuity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Algorithm to determine visual acuity. Web requests, and database systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting browsers, building a viable demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How visual acuity works, database management, JSON and AWS, and I learned how to integrate across platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 20/20
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determine distance via facial recognition, refining and improving algorithm and recognizing optical conditions through technology.
