                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to develop WhenPersonal when I first used WhenHub. I immediately noted that some awesome visualizations could be made by simply viewing time integrated social media posts. The best option for development was Twitter, a massively popular social media network that tags each post with a time stamp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WhenPersonal allows users to quickly create and populate a WhenHub schedule with information imported from twitter. Essentially, you give it a twitter name, and the application creates a schedule with the tweets that are associated with that name in chronological order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build WhenPersonal, I created a nodejs server hosted on Heroku. I used the server to create a routing system to the publicly available WhenHub API. I then created a front-end client that allows users to input their custom information in order to create the schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a variety of challenges while developing this application. First and foremost, I had to learn how to use the Whenhub API. This was difficult at first, but I picked it up quickly. After that, I had to develop the server and routing system, this took a lot of testing. And lastly, I ran into the common stylistic issues most developers have while creating a front-end client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that i was able to develop a completed application for the Whenhub API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about WhenHub and the products they offer. I also learned a great deal more about web development in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WhenPersonal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I am not exactly sure what the future holds for WhenPersonal, I believe it could be easily expanded to allow posts from other social media's such as Facebook. I am happy with it though!
