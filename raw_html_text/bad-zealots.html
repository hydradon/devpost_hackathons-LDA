                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were bored so we made something for fun.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a video game that's compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux built on an open source game engine. We even built it on linux too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Godot, an open source game engine, and it be popping.

                <p>
                    We've never built a video game before and we had to learn Godot while we built our game
