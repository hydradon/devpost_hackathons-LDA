                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    wanted to do something fun with the iCIMS Hackathon API; was initially meant to just be for rejected applicants (hence the name), but why not share the love
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    shows applicants what skills they may want to improve on for similar positions compared to their peers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    python with flask and the iCIMS Hackathon API; website from Domain.com redirects to the project, which is hosted on pythonanywhere.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learning flask and JSON
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learning flask and JSON
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to set up a basic flask website using templates
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The "Companies Keep Rejecting Me" Support Site!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    adding all the features I originally had planned, such as keeping snapshots of applicant skill levels across multiple updates and job applications (didn't have enough time to get everything working solo apart from bare essentials)
