                    We were inspired by the hardware showcased in the hardware lab, so we checked a Leap Motion. It tracks hand motion on 3D model. We were able to retrieve a output from the Leap Motion but was not able to transfer the data to a real-time 3d graphics engine, OpenGL. Our goals was to manipulate a object on screen by making gestures above the Motion, We learned quickly that the difficulty was not in the installation of OpenGL or the installation of the Motion but rather issues with communication and compatibility between versions code that were written way before or after the target Python release we were using.
