                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier this weekend a few of our friends couldn't decide on a genre of music. And then it hit, why not create a program that can make one sound file sound similar to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPLIXER allows you to choose two sound files and rearrange one so it may sound like the other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built SPLIXER by using a few java sound libraries so files can be cut up, sorted, and merged so that the program may work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Returning the average frequency turned out to be harder than expected and forced us to use a library in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our program does exactly what it claims to do, nothing more and a little less.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPLIXER taught us a few things
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Never waste time building a function that already exists on the internet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Come into hackathon with a plan
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SPLIXER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create a user-friendly UI for SPLIXER and release it as an opensource music remixer platform where others  can build interesting code and submit it on to the platform so others can use it.
                </p>
