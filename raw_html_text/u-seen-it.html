                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Desiring to bring together a community into a common gaming/learning experience, while using sponsor's API (ClarifAI) and social integration (Facebook), we create an everyone, everywhere experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A memory game that uses the clarifai api to gather predictions about a picture.  These predictions enable quick real-time creation of questions for a realtime, multiplayer memory game. Everyone joining the game gets the same picture of their phone, tablet or any computing device.  Players simply study the picture and when they believe they are ready to test their memory and knowledge, they click the Try it button.   The picture goes away and all you have to do is answer a question.  Easy as it sounds, it can be a brain-teaser!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    TOO MUCH MORE INFO...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fulfilling the MLH and Swamp hack tradition to build, share, and learn as a community, three first time hackers joined me on my second hackathon to build, share and learn on this U SEEN IT game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this game, everyone, everywhere, from any device join the same game together.  More than a game, it can be a tool used to educate.  In keeping with community, these pictures can be of our event, family holidays or other varieties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A future release and hosting solution will allow for direct upload of additional pictures, but a planned Facebook app page both promotes the site and seeks to inspire others.  This community effort results in a customized game experience contributed to by its users.  Family photos will be uploaded by a registered player and given password and category access.  This enables them to share the collection in a real-time game that the entire family can play --- even across continents.  Everyone playing sees the same pictures and answers questions about them in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What color shirt was Grandmother wearing in that last group photo? -- is a typical question that might be involved in the family/community social aspect, but there is no end to possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The demo provided shows a good example of how it works, what it can do, and how much fun and challenging it can become.  Its a memory game easy enough for anyone to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A question creator form allows anyone to add their own insight to the pictures shown, increasing the database of questions available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this U SEEN IT game, you simply watch pictures ( and possibly advertisements too ) all while playing a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to gathering information about the image from the clarifAI API, user interaction results in capturing HUMAN Intelligence data (English phrases and words) along with clarifAI image recognition for each of the image puzzles in the site.
