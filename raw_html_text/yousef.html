                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first semester freshmen in intro computer science, we wanted to develop a program that used the skills we learned in class to make our own project. We decided on simulating this game because while the logic of the game was simple, the game itself can become more and more complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program simulates the card game Yousef.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using our limited C++ knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So there's a lot of functionality in C++ that we haven't mastered yet, so implementation of the project was both longer and more inefficient. Additionally we had three other teammates who left after 6 hours on the project. This severely limited our abilities to code the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we are trying to work on to improve our method of coding is designing all of the parts of the project before actually coding. We spent a good hour or two just trying to figure out what we needed and how we were going to use it. While there were times we had to change the plan, for the most part we were able to stick to the plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how it is to work under a time crunch and to use what we know in a practical setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yousef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's still a lot of bugs that we are hoping to fix, but after that we probably won't do much more with the project itself.
