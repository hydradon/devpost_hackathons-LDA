                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have see the potential Instagram filters have now a days, so we decided to join a chatbot that offers the service to try out new clothes so you can decide better what to buy online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A chatbot that salutes you and waits for you to send an image to fit, or suggests a new clothe for you to try virtually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Facebook Pages, Facebook Messenger, chatbot technology and Spark AR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spark AR has some difficulties to publish to pages that represents productos or companies and publishing this filters are quite difficult to do.
Creating a need base on what people may want was difficult, because it offers new service for people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does what it says, gives the opportunity to people to try out new clothes virtually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of code in chatbot technologies and spark ar filters.
                </p>
