                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could have all the medicines in the world and it still wouldn't make a difference if our patients don't comply with their medication schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After speaking with several knowledgeable sponsors about this issue, our team decided to tackle this problem in such a way as to impact as many people as possible. We wanted to develop a solution to help people of all ages and background become more compliant in taking their medicine regularly while making it as easy as possible to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compliance and medication scheduling is especially an issue in our aging population. We envision something like The Med Manager being very useful in nursing homes and assisted living communities. More than 40% of people over age 65 take five or more medications, and each year about 1/3 of them experience a serious adverse effect. Being able to effectively schedule and track compliance in this population is crucial for safety and good patient outcomes.
