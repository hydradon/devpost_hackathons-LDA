                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet disrupted the brick and mortar retail model. Using AR we can bring the experience of brick and mortar-style shoping to where-ever you are on the planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through their phone, users can have a brick and mortar-style shopping experience anywhere on the planet without having to drive to a store ever again. Rather than viewing an image of the item as would be experienced through a website, they can visualize it in their world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has been developed in Unity using ARCore, c#, javascript, card.io &amp; ibm-watson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the UI so it works within the confines and restrictions of AR. Additionally, the ibm-watson plugin is still primitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team at redbull likes it and wants us to develop further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with the ibm-watson plug in and how to build UI for AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AR SHOP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the app is only a Redbull shopping experience. The long term vision is to build a tool that any company or individual can use to create their own AR store. Further because of the current user base this has been designed for mobile but the long term vision is to create a tool that everyone will use once smart glasses are used by the average person.
