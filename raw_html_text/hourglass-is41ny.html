                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're busy college students who are responsible for the contents of dozens of emails every day, especially remembering tons of dates. Calendar apps like Google Calendar are great for keeping track of events, but lack a good way to display the timeframe for tasks with deadlines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hourglass allows you to quickly add events and deadlines to your calendar much more easily than our competitors, and view your schedule in a convenient timeline form, in addition to providing the user with a customizable "Bulletin board" for the documents and emails that are important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 100% pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with no frameworks or libraries. It's hosted on Google Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user interface that we would use ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team collaboration, working under tight deadlines, and visual layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to project management skills, working under pressure, and branding and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned what Firebase is and how to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hourglass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have a lot of features to implement before it can be used. Completing the product is the next step.
