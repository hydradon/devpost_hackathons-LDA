                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A neighbourhood is defined as the area or region of a city situated around or near some important place or thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We usually make the erroneous assumption that different inhabitants of the same neighbourhood share the same definition of it but actually the extent and meaning of a neighbourhood is a very personal thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research shows that although the naming of an area might be similar to different people, the extent of it is strictly based on what daily public functions we can reach within a 15 minutes walking distance from our home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, a neighbourhood represents the area of a city surrounding the most important place in the city, our home. Our project intends to define it based on what places we can reach around it and their quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's My Neighbourhood calculates the walkable area from a particular place in the city based on its street network, the accessibility of some sites and most importantly the time it takes us to reach different functions, a maximum of 15 minutes of waking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Places API it then analyses the amount and distance to a set of daily functions such as restaurants, parks, grocery stores and shopping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It then grades the area based on all of this factors. And because we start from the assumption that all of us are different and require different daily public functions it also allows the user to grade the importance of different types of functions which in turn affects recalculated the score of its surrounding area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's My Neighbourhood is built on top of Google Maps. It calculates the walking area with the iso4app API and searches for nearby places by querying the Google Places API and calculates an indicator that describes the accesibilty and quality of life for the area, also allowing the users to compare different areas.
