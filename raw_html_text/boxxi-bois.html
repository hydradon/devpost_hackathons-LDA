                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heavily inspired by Starwhals.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boxxi Bois is a fun, addictive competitive game where the player plays against an AI and tries to take them down by hitting their weak spot while protecting their own.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the game itself, and Krita for graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we were planning on creating a 2D platformer sidescroller, yet within a couple of hours we realized our lack of knowledge and time wouldn't allow us to produce a sufficient game to demo. After playing around with Unity, we came across this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to adjust our plan to create a totally different game, as well as learning what we could about Unity within the short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've become a bit more familiar with Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Boxxi Bois
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better graphics and polished mechanics.
