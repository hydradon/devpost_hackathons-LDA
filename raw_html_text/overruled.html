                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever played a game and thought, "Why can't I do
                    <em>
                        this
                    </em>
                    ? Why is this against the rules?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overruled pits you against other players in a frenzy to reach the goal. It starts off painfully simple, but gets complicated really fast. Changes to the environment, attributes of your character, etc. tack on after every round. To be the winner at the end of 10 rounds takes skill, grit, and of course, RNG!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scenes and objects were created with Unity, and the behaviours were programmed in C# and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity had a steep learning curve and very specific settings to make the game look the way we imagined. Multiplayer on a network caused noticeable lag and many bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a working application using software we have never used, implementing multiplayer over a network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game dev is time consuming, but rewarding!

                    What's next for Overruled
