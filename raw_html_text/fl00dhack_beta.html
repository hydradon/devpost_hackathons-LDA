                    Flooding simulator made for HackRPI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overview:
This project allows users to simulate the extent of flooding for an area. We were inspired by similar technologies such as floodmap.net, which simulates sea level rise. However, floodmap.net is limited primarily to coastal flooding situations, as its technology is not designed for more inland areas such as lakes and rivers. Fl00dhack solves this challenge by allowing us to simulate flooding above any arbitrary point that the user can easily select, allowing individuals and organizations to see how at-risk their area is for a flood of a given height above normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technologies:
We constructed this as a webapp for easy accessibility. We use OpenStreetMap and LeafletJS for front-end rendering and user interface and the Google Maps elevation API for topographic data. In addition, we make use of JQuery to simplify the javascript code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Difficulties:
Our greatest challenge was locating good topographic data. Initially, we were attempting to use OpenTopography to access topographic data, but it turned out that their website was not suited to handling automatic POST requests. Instead, we chose Google Maps for its accurate elevation API.
