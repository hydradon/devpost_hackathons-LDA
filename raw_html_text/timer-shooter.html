                    What it does: Its an actionscript movie that runs automatically, with randomized character placement. The 2 characters change spots every second (This is where the timer comes in), and one character shoots 3 bullets per second. If a bullet hits the other character, the other character shrinks to 95% of its original size. This continues until the character shrinks 10 times, when the game stops and a game over screen is displayed
