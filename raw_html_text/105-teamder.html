                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever get frustrated by teammates who can't seem to work with you or simply do not share the same skills just because you were randomly allocated to a team or didn't know of better teammates beforehand? With Teamder, you will be in a better position to find new working partners to for a more fruitful project.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamder aims to be a platform for teams to be automatically assigned based on the relevant competency and interest in skills specified by an employer/module coordinator and personal preference (which is formed based upon a personal bio but other individuals). Teamder hopes to achieve near-optimal allocation for all teams alike so that everyone will have an enjoyable time throughout project development phases.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Node.js and other JS frameworks, as well as JS itself for the frontend, backend and the skill-matching algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered many problems and bugs while trying to integrate all the components together due to usage of multiple frameworks and potentially a lack of sleep.

                    Trying to (and hopefully have) completed it.

                    What I learned

                    more JS Stuff :)

                    What's next for Teamder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible extensions include the use of other metrics apart from skills and preferences (e.g. personality factors) in order to obtain more effective allocation results.
