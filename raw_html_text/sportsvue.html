                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make hockey more accessible and safer to anyone by developing hardware and software that develop positive safety habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a piece of hardware that clips onto a hockey helmet and warns the user when they are looking past a certain threshold angle for some amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses advanced mathematical methods to derive an accurate position of a player's head from cheap, inaccurate hardware. This is done in Python using Numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with serial data parsing and with implementing some advanced mathematics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our visualizations and accuracy of derivations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned extensively about Quaternion weighted averaging and Extended Kalman Filters.
