                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know I use to do lists a lot and wanted to include speech to text recognition so I decided I would come up with an idea where I can combine both.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes input from users in the form of speech input or text input and starts to create a to do list
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python and the SpeechRecognition library to build it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had an issue with SpeechRecognition as the PyAudio module is not properly being installed onto my laptop
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to get the speech to text recognition to work and then also include some form of a database, so that I can properly pull my data at all times
