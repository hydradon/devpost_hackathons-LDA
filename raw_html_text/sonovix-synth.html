                    Inspiration I am a music producer and I was inspired by other synthasizers and decided it would be a cool challenge to try making one myself
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It has 2 costume presets, a piano and a generic synth.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it I used affinity designer and affinity photo to disign the layout of they synthasizer with knobs and logos etc.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into A HUGE problum I got was when I finished, after working on it for 20 hours. As I saved the last big save my whole computer crashed and I lost all recent data. I did my best to recover and I did get back some. As a consequence I only have a small video showing the full usage of it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of I am proud that even tho I lost some of the project I did still finish and that feeling of success still lives on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned I learned that even if you don't have a huge team or you are a genius you can still persevere and when you set your mind to it, you can do many things.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sonovix Synth I will first recreate all that I lost in the computer crash and then I will add more controls such as pitch and high or low end fattening or Arpeggios. My ultimate goal is to make this a useful synth and I think it could get there if I put my mind to it.
