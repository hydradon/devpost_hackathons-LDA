                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that our Facebook textbook exchanges aren't very efficient and can be prone to misunderstandings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays textbooks based on what you provide (more options if you provide less, specific textbooks you need for if you provide as much information as possible: school, major, subject, year, course name)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Time problems, Google App Engine had gcloud errors that could not be resolved for java
                </p>
