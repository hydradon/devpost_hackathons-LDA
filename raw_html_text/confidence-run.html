                    </strong>
                    The impact we want our game, Confidence Run, to have on the community is to teach young boys from the beginning about how women are affected by misogynistic comments. We felt that what a woman wears or acts should not define her in any way. We wanted them to see the visual impact of the negative comments.

                    None of us have ever used Unity before until yesterday afternoon. This project was quite difficult. It took us hours to figure out how to properly create and shift things because they could not work simply because we weren&rsquo;t moving it the right way, even though we thought there was an error in the script and looked at the lines of code over and over searching for an error. Nevertheless, we persisted and continued working through the long hours of the night.
This hack can be an educational tool to teach young boys about the diverse cultures around them. Many boys do not have an exposure to mainstream things such as games that teach women empowerment and therefore can develop a biased sense of view.

                        "It" Factor
                    </strong>
                    The &ldquo;It&rdquo; factor about our hack is that it uses transforms a educational lesson into a fun and interactive video game which is more appealing to our choice of audience.
