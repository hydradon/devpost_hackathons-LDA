                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a time where we you can have reasonable conversations with your computer and you still need to ask a friend to sit in the audience, to give you feedback about your presentation. Why can&rsquo;t a computer do this by itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stage Mate listens to your talk and tries to match your speech to your notes and slides. Therefore, it can proceed to the next slide, track your time and tell you whether you missed the point or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stage Mate consists out of 3 modules. The First is audio processing and transcription module, that uses a sliding window approach in order to accomplish real time transcription with the speech to text apis by several companies.
The second module contains the logic for matching transcribed text to speaker notes and emits events to the presenter view, the third module. It is a custom implementation of the presenter view for the presentation tool reveal.js.

                <p>
                    We had to face following challenges:
no apis for live audio stream transcription
multi threading issues (sliding window)
conceptual challenges
                </p>
