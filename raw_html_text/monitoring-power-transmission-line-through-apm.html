                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are huge power losses in developing countries due to theft which lead us to create this solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically it monitors the power transimitted in transmission lines and runs analytics on this data to find out the deviations in power outputs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used APM (Asset, Time series,  Analytics, Dashboard) and Intel Edison kit to simulate required data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making Analytics work with APM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Even though we were finding challenges with setting up Analytics we never gave up and got it working.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We were able to setup Intel Edison kit quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Overall we could simulate the data required from power transmission line ,push  this data to APM time series and could run a basic analytics on this data to figure out losses in the power transmission lines.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a good start to explore APM stuffs out there on predix and it was fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Monitoring Power Transmission Line through APM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    power loss calculation should be improved using a standard formulas.
There is a lot of scope to improve the alerting mechanism from just sending an email.
