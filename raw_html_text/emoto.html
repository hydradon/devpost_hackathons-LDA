                    We were really interested in the Emotion API by Microsoft Cognitive Services. We wanted to utilize it in a way that it would make an impact on real life.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python as our coding language. We took a list of image URLs and calculated the average of each emotion the person feels.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to do this in Android Studio so we could how to use it.  However, we could not figure out how to implement the API correctly even with the help of documentation and mentors. This is why we decided to switch to Python, a language that most of our group is familiar with coding in.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to integrate an API into a working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that if something does not work out, you can always try and start over to get better results. We also learned that there is more than one method to implement an API.

                <p>
                    We want to create a better user interface and add more features relating to the information given about the person's emotions.
