                    Why?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This project set out with the goal of making online Tetris to be run in the command line. Our language of choice was C as it added a new layer of difficulty and allowed the prospect of porting the code to low power devices. A primary goal was to be very memory efficient with our core implementation.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Using Ncurses and a home made Tetris library written in pure C, we created a client/server model that allows people to play tetris online with multiple people.
