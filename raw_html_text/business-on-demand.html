                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our local markets, there is an unbalance between the type of stores in a given area, and we want to help business better manage their location. Many businesses fail to tap into certain markets, and by better managing the local businesses, we can boost the local economy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program compiles data from Capital One, and using Omnisci's visualization tools, we can help potential business owners perform better decisions on where to locate and how to manage their sales throughout the year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Capital One Hackathon API, we were able to extract data on consumer's spending habits. With the help of Omnisci, we were able to create a data visualization tool that can help businesses understand consumer spending behavior. This in turn will help managers better serve their client needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Omnisci tool was difficult to use and understand, and it took a lot of trial and error to achieve the desirable results. Also, one of our team members does not know how to program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use Capital One's API to visualize our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better use and understand API's, along with outside databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Business on Demand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyze consumer spending habits more effectively. (i.e. more categories and specific items sold). Creating more real time results, and hopefully next time based on real data given by Capital-One. We also plan on developing a proper heat map available along side the line graph. After having more time to understand OmniSci's documentation, we would efficiently embed the graphs made.
