                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my dad's story that during the time he was working in different companies, none of them had an online database or a website with all information about employees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This HR website is designed for users to be able to register, login and make their profiles, save notes and goals. This technically could be used for a company to maintain their own working environment and all information about their employees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website was made using HTML/CSS/Vue.js for the front end development and Django/Python/SQLite for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges involved working with django, when using Rest APIs, it was not clear on how to access all those class objects in different html templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to style the project and implement all kinds of views to access specific instances or members of the objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also styling, because it demands a good creativity and CSS/JavaScript knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is functioning properly and fully. It should be also bug free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Django libraries and implementation of different tasks as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HRPlat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HR Platform can be improved by adding some Careers page with position listings and maybe resume selection process.
