                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relieving the annoyance of bored customers as they wait in line due to insufficient cashiers.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps a count of customers inside the establishment as they enter and exit.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used an NVIDIA Nano Jetson Developer Kit with a camera to recognize people's faces in real time. When individuals were recognized, time stamps with corresponding coordinates were sent to a web server to be processed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original plan was to use Google's AIY Vision Kit, but it was incapable of recognizing individuals or sending data after over 6 hours of work.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perseverance and the prep work necessary to deliver a product in a time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure that your materials do the bare minimum they say that they're capable of before the Hackathon. Also, how to communicate data between Python and JS.
