                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As children, mood rings and necklaces always fascinated us because they "accurately" represented the moods of the wearers. Inspired by those memories, we created Umuros.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Umuros gives users a broad sense of Twitter's general mood at that moment. This mood is a result of the most recent tweets containing certain keywords related to 1 of 9 main moods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Umuros using Android Studio, Twitter4j, as well as the Android Graphics library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration on separate laptops was an issue towards the beginning of the project. However, we were able to work out the problems by using Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One feature of Umuros that we especially are proud of is the ability to let the user personalize their app by picking the colors that correspond to each of the moods. Hack K-State is our first hackathon ever, and we are proud that we were able to build a successful, working application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to display animated GIFs and create complex XML files in Android Studio. We also learned a valuable lesson in planning ahead and research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Umuros
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Umuros would be to adapt it for Android Wear.
