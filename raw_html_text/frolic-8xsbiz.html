                    The team wanted to build an application that could help people decide what to do with their day. We've all spent countless hours with friends coming up with different plans or, more annoyingly, been in new cities and not know where to go. Frolic asks you what your budget is, what modes of transportation you are comfortable amongst other questions before suggesting an ideal plan. Frolic even offers the indecisive a mystery option.
