                    Connected Receptacles - Using the IoT to increase the planned pickup efficiency.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This code utilizes a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c device as a connected device to monitor the state of a trash or recycling receptacle. Using Grove sensors the connected receptacle can self monitor its state and report back to the waste management service responsible for removing the refuse - opening opportunities to plan more efficient garbage truck routes and reducing pollution from refuse collection activities.

                    Our setup assumes the sensor monitoring the bin lid state is connected the the bottom-most 3.3V GPIO Grove connectors, with the bin waste level monitor connected to the port above. The ConnectedReceptacles.py file will monitor and detect a state change between either of these monitors. If the bin lid is found to be open more than five minutes, a notice will be displayed. Additionally, this will be displayed every five minutes thereafter until the bin lid is closed.
