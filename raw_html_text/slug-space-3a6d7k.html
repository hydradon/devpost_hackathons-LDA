                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parking spots are often filled up at North Remote, East Remote, and West Remote parking lots at University of California, Santa Cruz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells you the parking spots available, also can predict parking spots at a certain time of the day. It also predicts different capacity depending on the weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was built with a DragonBoard 410C running Microsoft Windows 10 IoT to handle events occurring at the parking lot. 
Python script was written to handle the prediction algorithm. 
MySQL was used for the database to handle events. 
Bootstrap was used to handle the front end of the webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DragonBoard 410C board was having difficulty connecting with the network since we did not have a display device, there was also difficulty with creating the application for the DragonBoard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MySQL database was a second thought, originally, the scripts held the data and also handled the data manipulation, implementing the database would cause less downtime in the event of full deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning a product that students would find useful and solves a real life problem. We were proud of the fact that we were able to hack something together that could be demoed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We learned a lot
                    </strong>
                    . We would like to put an emphasis on how much we learned from the great mentors of the event. They helped us with getting our front end working with BootStrap and gave helpful suggestions for ideas to work on it after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slug Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To implement some sensors to at least one remote lot to get some data and see if the prediction algorithm can successfully predict spots available after a few days.
