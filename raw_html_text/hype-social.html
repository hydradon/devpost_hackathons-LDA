                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're upper year uWaterloo students that love being involved with campus. We know first hand that there's usually too much going on or too little at any given moment--Hype Social helps you find the experiences and communities of people you're passionate about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Hype Social came from a simple premise: we're all apart of communities in one way or another, but it's hard to know what's happening! There are so many opportunities to meet people, grow and have fun all around us, but a lot of it gets lost in the noise. Amazing people are putting hard work in to make wonderful events, and amazing people are missing out. We set out to make a platform for communities to feel more connected, and make it easy to find events that are perfect for what you want to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hype Social is a platform that helps you connect with your community. In the app, it's easy to find and create communities and events that are trending and relevant to you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's simple: you join or make some communities (ex. Hack the North, Waterloo Foodies, your close friend group), vote what you like, and we'll take notes for next time so you always find things you like! Add events, participate and become an influence in your communities. Connect with people and enjoy yourself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With sweat, giggles, and soylent! As far as technology goes, we used Ionic and Cordova to build the app, and Parse as the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook's API integration with Parse and Ionic had a frustratingly show-stopping bug, so we couldn't leverage existing friends and interests to jumpstart event discovery--we were quick to hack up something else to keep going!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the laughs and good work we've gotten to enjoy together. It's heartwarming that a project to help people find worthwhile experiences was an extremely fun and rewarding experience itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bunch of new technical skills, but even more awesome was the experience of taking an idea all the way through with a newly formed team. We realized that even polished dev tools (even one's in the same ecosystem), aren't always reliable, and that was a fun challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hype Social
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides sleep, we're looking forward to having the opportunity to make a polished, complete version of our vision. Hype Social was always going to be an open platform, so we're excited to expand it to the open web too! Hype Social is something that came from a need in our everyday lives, and we're excited to get it ready, shipped and use it to hype up communities everywhere!
