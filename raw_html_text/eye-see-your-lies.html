                <p>
                    While taking an online exam I thought to myself there is no way for the proctor to see if students are lying or not. So, we tried to solve that problem.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a truth or dare game (published on Google Play Store) which detects if a person lied.
We use the phone's camera to take a video of the person while they answer a question.
A frame by frame image is sent to Google Cloud Platform where the algorithm analysis these images to measures the ratio of pupil to iris, in order to detect for dilation.
 An answer is sent back to the phone application which lets the user know if the person answering the question told the truth or not.

                <p>
                    Splitting a video frame by frame and communicating with GCP.
Data collection approach (how close does someone need to hold the phone camera to the eye).
Figuring out how to account for the dilation of pupil.
Distinguishing between pupil &amp; iris. 
No Dataset available on the internet to train our classifier.
