                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the corporate world, there are common operations/build teams for different products.
This needs them to have a lot of expertise in setting up different platforms.
Needs a lot of employee training time!
Needs a lot of money!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Give the user a generic platform to create any kind of build she likes!
All the complex details of scripting and setting up complicated build vanishes.
No special training and saves time!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a generic tool.
Calling the appropriate scripts from Java as per user inputs.
Parsing the nested JSON objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully able to build a Nodejs application fully automated! We were successful in overcoming all the above challenges. Yayy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need correct planning and tasks distribution in order for successful integration.
You need to have a clear idea of your project before starting the implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Generic Automated Build Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea can be extended to add many other features like- 
Add a GIT Hook, this will trigger the build automatically whenever there is a commit.
Add test analysis tool scripts in order to increase the maintainability of the code for eg. test coverage, automated test scripts to give you the report of the bugs.
