                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    62% of 18-24 years olds have been shown to experience some sort of stress related issues. I saw my own coursemates under depression and severe anxiety. To solve this problem, I had to achieve two main things,
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that the people are managing their time extremely well and efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide them a boost charge, i.e. some kind of portable therapy on the phone to keep them positive and refreshed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This inspired the creation of Project Uplift, an app to solve the most basic need for a ton of people - better time management and pressure handling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Uplift allows the user to very easily write a task for themselves, complete it, and check it off! The app also includes 50 of the most authentic relaxing sounds that will calm anyone down. All this has been combined with a beautiful user interface theme to make it a powerful beast for its look and feel. There is a time constraint associated with each task that the user has to complete. This will give them the motivation to keep going and fulfill their personal deadlines on time. What if they get stressed during work? The app will remind them to take a break where they can sit back, relax, and enjoy our custom selected sounds designed for ultimate relaxation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Uplift using the Swift programming language for the iOS ecosystem. Using catalyst (introduced with Xcode 11), the same app can be used to power the iPad, and even the Mac! I used UIKit framework for the User Interface and AVFoundation for the sounds. To keep track of the tasks and completion, I used the native framework Core Data. To design the entire prototype, I used Sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of challenges! But it's great, because I learned a lot from them. A great feature I wanted in Uplift was the ability to keep track of user's task completions. After a lot of tries, it still wasn't showing any signs of success for the implementation of the feature. But finally, going through the entire code, debugging, following the tracking functions, and a lot of web searching, I was able to get it working perfectly fine. Another User Interface problem was to figure out the best way to combine task and sound controllers. To achieve this, I had to design prototypes and wireframe on Sketch, and then convert it to the final product. In the end, I was very satisfied with the transition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I got everything working as expected within the time limit for UBHacking. It was a great pleasure to be at the event. I'm also proud of the positive impact Uplift will make on the people who are going through major stress and anxiety in their life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton of great things, including better UI Design, UX Design and multi-controller management for efficiency. I also learned more about the problem itself, and read about how people are experiencing their lives today, and what can be done to make it better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Uplift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A personal planner that will be your companion for life. That is what's next for Project Uplift. Combining tasks and sounds didn't seem a whole lot impactful during prototyping, but when I actually used the app, I was proved wrong. I loved the way both planner and audio were collaborating with each other to offer the most rewarding and joyful experience for the user.
