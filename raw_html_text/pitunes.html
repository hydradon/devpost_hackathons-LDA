                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developers create unique code all the time! What if that code was able to generate unique music? That's the idea that inspired us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you type or code, piTunes plays music based on the letters, numbers, and characters you type!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the raspberry pi and interfaced it with the sonic pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time getting it up to domains.com since the link is broken
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our punny identity! Along with that, we are inspired by the potential to produce unique music while typing unique code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that consistent failure leads to success
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for piTunes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to take it to the next level and add more sound kits or sets of sounds per letter to see the kinds of melodies that can be produced while writing unique code.
