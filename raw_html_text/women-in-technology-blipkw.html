                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were both apart of WiTNY Summer Guild at Cornell Tech this summer and we both wanted to continue the mission of empowering women in the theme of this event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides women educational and professional resources regarding a career in the technology industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a platform called Glitch which allows users to implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make websites and apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited to knowledge due to being a small team of two and general web developing issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of coming to this hackathon and creating a decent website despite the time restraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both became more comfortable working in a group setting and also gained knowledge using JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Women in Technology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue updating the website with additional resources and create a more dynamic website.
