                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are students from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.
                    <strong>
                        Nashville, aka music city,
                    </strong>
                    is also one of the most dangerous cities in the US. It ranks #15 last year for its crime rate. Violent Crime Rate = 1,101/per 100,000 people. 10 days ago, we went to a hookah bar very close to Vanderbilt, we did not stay there for very long but two security guards got shot at that bar the very same night. When we looked it up, we found that there had been previous instances of similar incidents happening in the same area and we had no idea about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This freaked us out. How could we enjoy the city safely? How could we avoid the unsafe areas? 
The fact is, a lot of cities in the US are not safe to walk. How do we solve this problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As data science students, we wanted to find a data-driven solution that can help people know when they are walking through an area with violent crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year, our theme is connecting the dots. When we think about
                    <strong>
                        connecting the dots
                    </strong>
                    , daily navigation come to our mind. Is it possible to use the crime event data to build a navigation application and help people know if they are about to be walking through a particularly unsafe area?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application will show you areas with violent crimes and help you navigate around them. It can also help you know if you are in a particularly crime-heavy area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of useful information such as Vanderbilt University Police Department contact info and nearest hospital to your location are provided as well.

                        We created data pipelines using python to extract Nashville open crime incident data, clean the data and add the features.

                    <li>
                        We use google maps api to help us with the navigation part and we push it to the flask.

                        We use Flutter to develop the mobile application.
