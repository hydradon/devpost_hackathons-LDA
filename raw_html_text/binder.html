                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been searching for jobs lately and noticed that I would constantly see the same jobs that I didn't want to apply for over and over again. I wished for an easier way to get in touch with the recruiters that also wanted to talk to me. This way I didn't waste my time applying everywhere and they didn't waste their time reading resumes of people they don't want to hire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects job-seekers directly with recruiters and helps to establish a line of contact, assuming they both matched each others' criteria.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized php, java servlets, and mySQL for the back end, with HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery, for the front end. Bootstrap was also used to help to create a scalable app that will work on any screen size.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that uploading an image was a challenge due to odd security settings on my computer. With all of the PHP in this project, it was hard to keep track of where there might be possibilities for an SQL injection or other possible exploits. We discovered that the creation of hybrid applications is not a fun time. Time constraints were also a large challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all pushed each other to learn a lot about new technologies and I believe we all tried to implement code we had never used or seen before in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never really written any PHP before this hackathon, and now I feel very comfortable with the language. I think we all learned how to communicate and work together, even though we were all working on different, yet very important pieces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Binder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A possible cross-platform mobile app is in the works! For the time being, we will most likely open source the project and host it on github for others to learn from our sloppy coding.
