                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted two things at the same time. We wanted a way to find new music without having to search for it, and we also wanted an app that would automatically play music that fit the right mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use google awareness to track when earphones are plugged in. When it detects that earphones are plugged in, it automatically plays music based on your situation. The situation being your location, time, and weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using react native
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew react native, nor had any of us done mobile development before. It also took us a long time to get set up. Additionally, we didn't realize react native does not work well with google awareness until we were too deep into trying to learn react native to back out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got somewhat familiar with react native.
We learned some about using permissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of work to do when it comes to functional languages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we get it to actually do what we want, we then want to make it so that the app is always running in the background
