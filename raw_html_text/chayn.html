                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right before the beginning of a hackathon, there is always the rush to find the perfect teammates. We thought that it was inefficient to gather teammates through different platforms such as Facebook, Slack, GroupMe, etc. We decided to create Chayn which makes the ideal team for a hackathon with a fun gaming aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chayn matches you at hackathons with various people with different skill sets. When registering, the hacker chooses a role between Gatekeeper, Tactician, Architect, Merchant, and Watcher.

                    These roles contribute to grouping students at hackathons such that they can search profiles for specific skills they want to add to their team. Depending on which skill sets a user has, a level is assigned to him/her. The main goal of this app was to keep the interactive portion of team building, but making it more efficient to save time for the actual hacking part of hackathons.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the landing page of the application in order to provide information and a place to register or sign in. After a user is registered, they are brought to the dashboard. The dashboard is currently prototyped with Adobe XD and is what we imagine the platform design to display.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm for sorting people into levels based on their skill sets is done with Python.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Developing the algorithm for scanning devpost profiles and github repos was very difficult to handle. Our main idea was to utilize the API for both in order to classify skill sets based on the number of hackathons attended, number of hackathons won, and number of followers.
