                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mood tracking apps are known to help many individuals dealing with mental health struggles understand and learn about their mood changes, improve their mood, and manage their mental illnesses (AMIA Annu Symp Proc. 2017; 2017: 495&ndash;504).  However, many people have trouble fitting the task of charting mood into their daily routine -- recording daily mood seems unimportant, many individuals struggling with their mental health have low motivation to accomplish this kind of mundane task, it's a small task that's easy to push off indefinitely, and it serves as a daily reminder of their difficulties or disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pilot encourages individuals to fill out their mood tracker, and it helps them do so in an efficient, natural, and engaging way.  And while many suffering from low mood find themselves stuck in self-propagating cycles of negative thinking and isolation, Pilot strives to boost mood more effectively than current trackers by actively listening and responding, and by introducing people to unique places and cultures around the world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pilot serves as a browser landing page, and each day a unique picture of a mystery location encourages users to engage with the app in order to identify where the image was taken.  Users are prompted to discuss the events of the day out loud, though they can enter text if they wish -- this style of information is more efficient and natural than the process required by most mood trackers, and encourages comprehensiveness and candor.  Pilot then responds to the individual's sentiment and prompts them to reflect on their current mood further with a probing question.  Once the user has responded to these questions, Pilot recommends how the user may be feeling on three different scales, mood, anxiety, and cynicism, allowing the user to adjust as they see fit.  Once this step is complete, the destination is revealed and the user can explore the location they were matched to for that day.  Pilot also provides users with a clean environment with which to view their mood and mental health history.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Watson for sentiment analysis, Rev for speech-to-text, and Amadeus to identify sights and Mapbox and Wikipedia to display information about locations.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We're extremely proud of all the features we were able to pack into Pilot in 24 hours.
