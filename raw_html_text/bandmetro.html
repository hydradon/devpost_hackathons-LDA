                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cheapest metronome hardware is like $200 and most Ethiopian bands doesn't either use metronome or only the drummer uses it guiding the entire band. Using a simple software and almost without any extra hardware, a metronome can be made for everyone on the bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will have a master slave feature and the master (host/band leader) will create a WiFi network (hotspot) so that the slaves (other band members) will join his network and group play their music in a synchronized tempo. The host will have features to choose different tempo and patterns for the desired music. Using those features he will host a session just with a single phone, so that other band members join the network with their own phone. Its completely hardware free, cost effective and easy.
The application can also be used for plethora of choices. It can be used for bands, group activities and games, for group athletic training etc..

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the entire software using a rapid android application development tool. The application is built using an account managed by two accounts, so we were able to achieve maximum capability in developing the software.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was the first time for either of us to develop an android based application, we had a hard a hard time trying to understand the way through the development process. Furthermore, the time constraint was another issue we had to manage.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We self-learned what it takes to make a phone application - it is not as easy as it looks!
Time management is a crucial skill in app development.

                    What's next for BandMetro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be marketed for bands and interested individuals at a cheap price once the application is fully developed and functional. It can as well be the first mobile based metronome used by official music bands. It saves time, money, and resource.
