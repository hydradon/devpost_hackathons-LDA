                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever made a game or used Unity before, so no better time to try than a hackathon. We wanted to have a fun, code-related platformer, which is where the idea to make it about Octocat came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Octocat's Journey is a 2D platformer all about getting to the pull request at the end so he can merge it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We exclusively used Unity for the game engine, and used prefabricated sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complete lack of knowledge of Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a working game, which is way more than initially anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is a fantastic tool for game development, which is simultaneously harder and easier in many ways than we could have imagined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Octocat's Journey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create more levels, add our own custom sprites, and add more attacks from Octocat.
                </p>
