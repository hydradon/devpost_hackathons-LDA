                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was valentines day combined with the fact that most dating applications are now apps and not websites. We wanted to make a website for our generation to find people who are similarly goal oriented.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Matches people based on age and what they are looking for, then displays information similarly to those on LinkedIn to show each individual the other's credentials like career, education, a resume, etc...

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever tried coding before Saturday, so that was difficult, but we had a lot of fun learning and can't wait to learn more!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entirety of LinkedUP is our accomplishment!! We are proud of how far we got and how much we learned considering none of us have ever coded before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                    How to use HTML, other languages of coding, different components of building a website or other application, and opportunities within coding.

                    Working on creating a "back" to our website and a database so the information entered actually goes somewhere...then making wonderful matches for young and old professionals alike everywhere.
