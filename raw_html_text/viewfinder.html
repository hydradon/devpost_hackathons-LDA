                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love travelling and taking artsy photos, but sometimes it's just hard to find the right place if you're not a local. We wanted to make something that would connect the beautiful views to our cameras.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter a city, and Viewfinder will give you all the places to explore in order to find the perfect photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parsed the html of various travel and photography blogs to build a database stored on Firebase for 6 cities. Then we built a website that channels the database information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty parsing the html and linking all the images correctly to their locations. Additionally, we were stuck on the website's formatting for quite a while.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that the website is functional for 6 cities, and provides some new information on photo spots in popular tourist destinations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a sleek and clean website is a difficult task. In terms of technical information, we learned how to use Bootstrap 4 and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Viewfinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand to other locations around the globe, and take in more data from multilingual blogs to find the places that only locals know best. Additionally, we would like to allow the user to upload their own photos and locations, as well as rate the currently existing ones.
                </p>
