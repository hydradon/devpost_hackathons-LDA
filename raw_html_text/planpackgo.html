                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our passion for traveling and vision for making the tedious process of traveling easier for everyone. As I've heard during the seminar, we're living in an age of data overflow, and the younger generation seems to be adapting to the abrupt changes quite smoothly. Contrarywise, older generations seem to have trouble when it comes to gathering data(for example, my grandpa loves to travel, but he don't know where to visit due to lack of knowledge) due to the fact that it's usually much more tedious for them and they are not as flexible when it comes to methods of gathering data. For example, compared to the older generation, the younger generation usually has an easier time gathering data from different sources such as Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, or simple Google research involving Yelp and Hotels.com. Therefore, especially for the older generation, we wanted to make the tedious process of researching and planning for the trip as easy and fast as possible.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gathers the user's preference scores(Pscore), their traveling location(city), and by using the score, it finds them hotels, landmarks, and restaurants that's closest to their preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first prototyped what the website would look like on Figma, gathered/created database for the site through MongoDB(prices, ratings, preference scores for hotels, landmarks, and restaurants), connected through Azure, and put everything together so that the user can log in, set their preference score, and made sure that the hotels, landmarks, and restaurants that closely match the user's preference score is displayed first.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    &bull;We were not able to find a good database for hotels, restaurants, landmarks and their prices and ratings. Therefore we had to manually create a database through MongoDB
&bull;Figuring out the user flow
&bull;Collaboration flow

                <p>
                    &bull;Try to find a good database
&bull;Actually finish the website so it's fully functional, with enough data
&bull;User test on people in order to find out what we're lacking
&bull;Additional functionality such as allowing the user to give the rating, and preference score so that we can get more accurate data
