                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project came from the vision of the developers and their aim at making a family-friendly robot with plenty of social skills. We saw a robot and we instantly wanted to work with the little guy and make a program that would further increase its handiness in households around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stop &amp; Go is a game based on the classic children&rsquo;s game &ldquo;Red light, Green light&rdquo; where Jibo acts as the &ldquo;stoplight&rdquo; and the users try to touch Jibo. Users can only move on the green light and have to stay still on the red light, otherwise Jibo&rsquo;s motion detections will indicate if you are out! Touching Jibo will sense the pressure and announce that the game is over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using node.js, and the program called Atom with Jibo packages and functions implemented. We were fortunate enough to be able to test and debug the features we created on actual Jibos provided here at MLH Prime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the many challenges we ran into consist of setting up the unstable open-source software for all different systems, coding with no prior JavaScript experience, and analyzing and sculpting different actions and behaviors for Jibo to use. We couldn&rsquo;t quite get process of Jibo identifying the different users, but we got very close.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning a new language, getting Jibo to first dance and get animated was a huge milestone for us. Next was the voice recognition and responses that lead to us being able to interact with Jibo. And lastly, the full-fledged activity of playing a game is a huge accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js is a tough platform to work with!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stop &amp; Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next objective for Stop &amp; Go, is working towards identifying all players and accurately tracking their movements when Jibo is looking at them when the new SDK comes out.
