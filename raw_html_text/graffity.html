                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to build a VR game for kids in hospitals. We wanted to build a game that was fun to play and funny to watch for people around the players. 
Kids love to scream so we used voice recognition to control the game in a virtual environment. Because you have to scream funny words, it is funny for people around the players as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graffity lets the user throw balls of paint on the wall using voice recognition. The more ball you throw, the highest is your score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graffity is built on Unity. It works on the google cardboard and the Tango Project.
