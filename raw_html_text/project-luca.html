                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To anyone (at Hesiod or otherwise), welcome! Project Luca is our Accounting tool, commissioned by the hLabs department of the Hesiod Financial group. The goal of this tool is to create a centralized application to give all members of Hesiod Financial the ability to easily access information on the finances and portfolio distributions as well as to give specialized members of Hesiod the ability to deposit and withdraw funds for investments and miscellaneous expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project began out of a desire for all members of the Hesiod Financial Investment Group to be able to move away from Excel/Google Sheets to something more sophisticated. This project also began as a general testing grounds for the members of the hLabs team to become acclimated to working in a large group setting, using version control and Agile SDLC methodologies, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of this has amounted towards a final product that not only employs innovative technologies and approaches to tracking operations in Hesiod but towards a product that we are very proud of.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it currently stands (2/17/19), Project Luca is capable of recording locally generated transactions on the user's machine that can either be banking- or trading-related. That is, once runtime concludes, all Objects created are erased. Users are able to login via a basic authentication module that requires a username and password. The outline of management permission hierarchy is present within Luca such that a General User (lowest tier) can only request Transactions, while Sector Heads and Officers can resolve/act on them. Behind the scenes, the security of Luca is powered by java.security and blockchain functionality. In this way, Project Luca provides the reassurance of blockchain security and the basic functionality of transaction-based protocols of portfolio management.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was primarily developed in Java and Java plugins. The frontend was developed in Adobe XD to create the modern-looking user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Luca
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future we plan to implement Firebase to allow for multi-user capabilities on both desktop and web and integrate real-time stock and options data to update Portfolio and Account values accordingly.
