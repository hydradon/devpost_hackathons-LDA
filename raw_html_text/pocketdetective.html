                    Travellers all know that a tourist destination is a haven for pickpockets and thieves. Bags, purses, wallets - they're the prime targets of stealthy hands and searching eyes. We know this, and yet we still somehow find our passports missing the moment our guards are let down. This is why our team created the PocketDetective! This smart device uses sensors that are triggered when someone attempts to open your bag without the access key. Users no longer need to stay anxiously alert while visiting popular attractions and walking through busy crowds. You can count on PocketDetective to protect your valuables and freely enjoy your time.
