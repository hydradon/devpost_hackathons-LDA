                    tired of typing in the same input fields and clicking the same buttons every application?
so are we.
that's why we made
                    <strong>
                        internboat
                    </strong>
                    .
here's your one-stop shop for all things internship. instead of having to fill out the same text fields every application, you can load your one-time
                    <strong>
                        internboat profile
                    </strong>
                    to auto-populate those fields. search for whatever internship you desire, and our web scraper will prompt you for any extra information that your application might require. 
this project was made in definitely less than 36 hours by
                    <strong>
                        4 girls
                    </strong>
                    with a passion for code. it's a sweet little thing made from
                    <strong>
                        html, css, javascript, firebase
                    </strong>
                    , and a few tears mixed in. it's not quite done, but we hope you enjoy.
