                    This presentation is about a Chatbot solution that was built for a leading Music Company for their global sales reporting solution comprising of physical, digital and combined sales. The company used existing web application for querying sales information which was a complex and tedious process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Music Company was looking at innovative alternate solution which provided easy access of sales figures with an enriched user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LTI came up with a Chatbot solution as an innovative option to increase user adoption of the their web portal for global sales reporting as the user can get all information with simple intuitive conversation and not requiring any application knowledge. The solution leveraged Amazon&rsquo;s Lex services for building Chat interface. The Chatbot enables the business user to retrieve the information needed at any time as the Chatbot is an always ON model.

                    Chatbot can handle user queries based on 3 parameters:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Artist
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Region
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Period
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Chatbot solution architecture involves a NodeJS based framework that provides various channels such as HTML, Facebook and Slack for the Chat. NodeJS npm module &ldquo;aws-sdk&rdquo; for Amazon web Services makes configuration with Amazon Lex through the configuration ids thereby establishes communication channel with the framework.
