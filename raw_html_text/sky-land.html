                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i was going to make a 2d platformer for fun but wanted to get the physics part done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    simulates a 2d physics engine with blocks. there is a "character" (sort of) you control and can collide into the ground and walls. falling and jumping has a gravity/acceleration effect to simulate accurate physics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the SFML graphics library to build a simple environment and then created the physics by calculating intersection points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the first algorithm I used glitching through the ground happened a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally getting it to not glitch through the ground while jumping
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    physics are annoying
                </p>
