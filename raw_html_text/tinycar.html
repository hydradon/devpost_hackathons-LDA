                    ## Inspiration
Car accidents cause trama, injury and death. It is the single most dangerous thing we do every day. It is tedious and difficult. Wouldn't it be better to get a ride with the most precise driver on the planet?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Tiny Car takes environmental information in and makes decisions about the world around it. The smooth acceleration and deceleration make the Tiny Car a safe driver and a safe neighbor.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Python shells and worked hard to configure raspberry pi's pins to make an awesome demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The raspberry Pi has a very small output voltage and current. The car cannot be very heavy or go very fast. We only had one analog output to work with. Rony did research on transistors to control the power given to the wheels. Due to the nature of the internet at Universities shelling into the pi is very difficult.  The power behind our idea lies in the concept.

                    Getting 4 Wheels on the CAR!!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MUCH! Our team started with little to no hardware experience and we built a demo of a self-driving vehicle. We learned Python and a lot about a secure shell. I think the whole team learned that when you do a hardware hack, You should bring some scissors.

                    What's next for tinyCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wants to keep developing tiny car. We can make tiny car smarter and faster and more beautiful with better hardware and more time.
