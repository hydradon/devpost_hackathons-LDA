                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Blackrock's Performance API,we were able to analyze the best performing stocks based on risk rates and our own algorithm to identify possible loss, and finally match them to your needs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial forays into understanding the various intricate theories had ended poorly and there were several frustrating moments, but it was the amalgam of a strong motivation to deliver and several cups of coffee that resulted in a fully-functional Android application that made use of concepts and technologies that we had never before come across. Our failures seemed inconsequential compared to our inquisitiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important part of the process, for us, was how much we were able to learn over thirty-six hours. The fact that none of us had any form of prior experience working with any of the technologies that we worked with over the weekend, and yet, managed to develop a fully-functioning application using Blackroad's Performance API on Android-Studio, is something that we are extremely excited about!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it has been a tough week with almost no time to sleep, we had a great time exploring areas of computer science and technology, like: Application Programming Interface. We learned to work with Android-Studio, Java, JSON, and APIs!
                </p>

                    What's next for FindMeStocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to launching FindMeStocks on the Play Store. That, and we also look forward to integrating the application, in the near future, with elements of machine learning to collect and analyze real-time available market data and optimize the data to meet your needs and budget.
