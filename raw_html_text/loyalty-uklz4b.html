                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the consumer side, we were inspired by our frustrating experiences in losing our loyalty cards and the inconvenience of having to individually find a loyalty card among a sea of too many loyalty cards and apps. From the business side, we were especially inspired by small businesses who do not possess the technological infrastructure and expertise to build their own loyalty card app such as a small cafe chain like Devon Cafe. We wanted to find a way for small businesses to leverage customer data from our loyalty card app system, an opportunity not provided by paper loyalty cards that most small businesses currently give out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app solution provides a centralised platform for loyalty cards. On the launch screen, the customer is greeted with a list of all the loyalty cards they own in one place, increasing convenience for the customer. By clicking on a specific loyalty card, a new page pops with the current loyalty rewards status visually displayed and the loyalty card number. Once a business inputs the customer's loyalty card number into the system and accesses a database, the app automatically updates the loyalty rewards status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Example
                    </em>
                    For a small cafe that offers a free coffee after ten coffees, if a customer has already bought four coffees, it would show a row of ten small cups with four of the cups filled in. Once the cashier enters the card number into their system which updates the customer's entry in a database, the row of ten small cup updates with five of the cups filled in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into technical challenges while hacking. Initially, we set out to do the project using React. However, this proved too difficult and ambitious based on our existing programming knowledge. Only one of our group members had any experience in javascript let alone React with a lot of time spent trying to learn javascript and React using online tutorials and videos. We also attempted to implement a QR code scanner into our app but this provided too difficult to do so under the limited timeframe we were under.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well as a team during our idea creation phase, where we spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas instead of diving straight into coding. Individually, we brainstormed several ideas for thirty minutes before coming together as a team to pitch and discuss our ideas. By doing this, we settled on an idea which every group member was enthusiastic about. We also successfully conducted field research where our online survey managed to receive over 90 responses, along with a talk to a cafe barista in Surrey Hills who believed our app could be beneficial to his business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we have learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how important it was to use technical knowledge that we already possessed instead of trying to learn new frameworks and languages from scratch in a 24 hour time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Loyalty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a longer time frame, we would try to implement a QR code scanner to improve convenience, along with a login system for the customer so that the consumer can access their loyalty cards anytime and anywhere in case they lose their phone.
