                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever have something to tell your roommates but don't want to do it face to face? Passive-Aggressive Aggressive Board allows you to leave an anonymized note through an Amazon Echo in the living room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can tell it to remind your roommate something while being keeping your identity hidden (unless you're the only other roommate). You can also ask what messages do you have and it will tell you your unread messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Alexa Skill Kit to talk to a AWS Lambda function that stores and retrieves data to and from an AWS DynamoDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Skills Kit and AWS are definitely not the easiest to get started with out there nor they have good/useful documentations. However we got to come up with different workarounds that help us achieve the solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sorting out some stuffs ourselves because the documentations are either outdated or insufficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outdated documentations and tutorials can be drastically different from the latest solution.
                </p>

                    What's next for Passive-Aggressive Aggressive Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're gonna integrate Twilio API to text the roommate when he/she has received a new note.
