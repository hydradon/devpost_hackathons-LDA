                    a## Inspiration
We were inspired by the idea of decentralized application (dapp) where you can trust the system since the application runs on the blockchain network and there is no way to alter the data or the code on the smart contract after it gets deployed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially it does a wealth redistribution. Anyone with at least 1 eth in their account could join the game.  You pay 1 eth when you choose to join the game and the contract owner can start the game. When the game start, a random generator will roll a dice for everyone in the game and the eth you pay will be redistributed based on the number you get. For example, if there are two players in the game, player 1 rolled the 3, and the player 2 rolled 4, the player 1 will get 3/7 * (2 eth) and player 2 will get 4/7 * (2eth) since we have 2 players in total.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first build the contract and deployed in the eth network, and then we spend a lot of time building the front-end using react for this dapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lot's of bugs for the lib and app we are using to run our dapp, for example, the wallet application metamask. This app has a bug that does not receive any event that fired by contract. It took us 1 day to resolve this issue.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is up and running well!

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    There is long way to go for Dapp.

                <p>
                    Make the real random generator, figure out a way to use random.org api.
