                    Groups often have troubles organizing sober drive, the thorough solutions are only really comprehensible sober and the simple ones often leave much to be desired.

                    DrunkDial allows groups to select sober drivers for specifics days and and they will automatically be marked active for the correct time. When it is time for a ride, a user can easily press one button and it will begin to call the sober driver for that night.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for app development, AWS to host the mariadb service which is interfaced through an apache server that is accessed through a custom restful API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent the first night trying to have the app talk directly to the database, this was a bad idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made lots of progress for a completely rookie team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    If every tutorial says to do something a certain way, there is probably a good reason.
