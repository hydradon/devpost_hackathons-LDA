                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool which helps people to learn languages quickly and easily. The Ariel tool can be used anywhere at anytime and lets you discover your environment in a new way.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Take a picture and upload the photo to the Ariel page

                    <li>
                        Choose the language you would like to translate to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receive the translated word of the object in the photo and some sample sentences for you to use yourself! Easy.

                    We used:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        CamFind API for the object recognition

                    <li>
                        Google Books API to refine the CamFind output

                    <li>
                        Google Translate API to translate the given word into your target language

                        <p>
                            HavenOnDemand Query Text Index API to search for the relevant Wikipedia page in your chosen language

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Python scripts were used to run the APIs

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            php was used to combine the API scripts and to handle image upload
                        </p>
                    </li>

                <p>
                    The wifi was initially less than ideal! Towards the end we ran out of time to link up the back end and the front end of the project.

                <p>
                    We have all learnt a lot (in particular about how to use APIs! Thank you mentors!!) and we are really proud that we finished with a product that looks similar to how we envisaged it at the start.
