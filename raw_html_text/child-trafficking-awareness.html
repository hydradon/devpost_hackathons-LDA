                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I lead a child trafficking awareness club at my school and it has been a really important topic in my life. A few months ago, I met a survivor of child trafficking who is an advocate and a voice against sex trafficking. Since then, her words and strength has inspired me to spread awareness on the topic- one way is with an educational website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It teaches users about the fundamental aspects of child trafficking. It is an opening for the user to learn more on their own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Notepad++ with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to make the slideshow on the homepage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we have made an informational site for everyone to learn about child trafficking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a slideshow and navigation bar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Child Trafficking Awareness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can expand on our coding abilities and build upon this website so that it can have features like a donation button and an interactive map.
