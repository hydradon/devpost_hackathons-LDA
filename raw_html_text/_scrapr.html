                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing quiz-up got really boring, because we were limited to predefined topics. What if we could input any topic and, using the immense wikipedia knowledge base, the game would automatically generate questions?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It basically scraps a given wikipedia topic and tries to generate multiple-choice questions from them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a number of nlp libraries for python, and a RESTful server for the actual game.
First, we filter the sentences to strip out the citations and other un-needed characters.
Then, we eliminate the longer sentences, that would be very difficult to parse.
After, we pre-process every sentence, using a hidden-markov-model algorithm to tag the parts of 
speech for every word. Breaking the sentence by noun phrases, verb phrases and prepositional noun phrases gives 
us a possibility to crudely generate a question
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This subject is not too well documented, as there are only a few attempts at this, and even those made by
PhD students for their dissertation. We also encountered several library bugs and dependency problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great amount of things about nlp and we improved our experience with python and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more than we expected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for _scrapr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the question generation algorithm, and we also plan to implement a classifier to
rank the generated questions by their syntactic structure.
If we had more time, we'd have implemented an algorithm to check the grammar and correct any mistakes.
