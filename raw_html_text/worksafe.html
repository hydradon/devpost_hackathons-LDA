                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a practical Google extension that students and people in the workplace (or anyone else!) could utilize. Accidentally having an awkward picture in public places show up is an uncomfortable thing anyone can relate to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Chrome extension that scopes out all the images of each webpage, checks whether or not it is considered safe for work, and replaces the nsfw ones with pictures of cute doggos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Clarifai API, which can detect elements of images. Using the nsfw mode, we created this extension in Javascript/ajax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some bugs pulling requests from the API, and also some issues using ajax at first due to its asynchronous aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very exciting to create a Google extension and watch it work in realtime. We started out basic and added bits of functionality, so there was a lot of sense of accomplishment as each successive bit succeeded (and also frustrations when everything crashed).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs (all our first hackathon!) and how to create a Google Extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WorkSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have ideas for more functionality, such as being able to replace gifs, letting the user change the "nsfw level" or what pictures to replace with, and maybe parental controls with a password.
