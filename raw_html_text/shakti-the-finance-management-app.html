                <p>
                    There are fewer women who know how to manage their finances and fewer women entrepreneurs in India. Women have business ideas but don't have the resources to scale it to the next level. Often, they don't have access to guidance and fundings.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Shortage of time to add more features.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though we didn't added a lot of features but we were able to fully complete whatever features we had initially planned.
The app is in full working condition.
Firebase makes it faster than most servers because of its real-time  database.
