                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to create a platform where groups of friends who are travelling together have an easy way to keep track of planning a trip together with details such as hotel bookings or transportation details etc. Then we realized that this would also be useful for companies to easily track expenses to employees while travelling for business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to first create the business side of our idea first and do the side for casual users later since it could be built upon the logic used for the business side as it is more complicated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TripRails allows management to have a way to organize all their employee travel expenses, ranging from housing to travel to food. It allows the trip planner to have greater flexibility in budgeting various parts of their travel expenses. each employee can have a separate housing and transportation stipend, as well as a food budget per diem.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used a react frontend and backend running Django with Python 3.7 and communicated between the two using the APIs.
