                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quest always seem to lack some information or the other. It feels incomplete as one important source of Course Information. So we decided to make an extension to fill in the gaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension gets all your current courses and section assignments and finds the allocated books and other materials along with their cost and remaining stock in the UW Bookstore
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built primarily using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this hackathon we had not worked with javascript or any other web framework before but still managed to come up with a logical albeit incomplete solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, jQuery, how passionate we are to solve real problems in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UW Bookstore Extension
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features, more info, good design and of course more efficiency. A potential feature is the integration of an amazon purchase link alongside the books. The sky is the limit.
                </p>

                    Note

                <p>
                    The extension is incomplete and the books are yet to be injected into quest web page.
