                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that motivates people to stay active and stay connected with their friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users sign up online and download the app. A group of friends can each put in an equal amount of money, to create a pool that the user with the highest step count at the end of a certain period of time wins. The app uses a pedometer to keep track of the user's steps per day and it compares it to the number of steps of their friends over the challenge period.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the server to the app was a real challenge for our group.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    A straight 36 hours awake! We're proud of the amount we learned over this period of time about android programming and creating servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a server that can gain response from an online page and from an android app.
