                    As lovers of road trips, its hard to calculate when you will run out of gas and where the nearest gas station is without going too far off your route.

                    We used Meteor.js, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap and Google Maps API to form our program.

                <h2>
                    We had a lot of challenges with learning new software in a short period of time. Also, incorporating the Google Maps API. We had challenges with GitHub and finding a power-strip.

                <h2>
                    We are proud of the work we put into so we could create our idea. Our code might not be completely functional but we did our best in the amount of time we were given. Most importantly, we are proud of ourselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We all learned the importance of teamwork. We improved and expanded upon our coding and web development skills. We learned how to run on exhaustion.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We hope to have the code working, and make it into an iOS and Android app for all to use.
