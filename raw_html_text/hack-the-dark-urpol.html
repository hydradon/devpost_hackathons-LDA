                    A game for hackers to practice their HTML5 and CSS skills.  In this piece of software a player has to recreate the look of shown web page so it would look as similar as possible. It also includes protection from cheaters who try to use internet or other programs that could run their code or assist the player in any other similar way. To cut long story short, the player can only use his own knowledge while attending the challenge. There are 3 levels of challenges, each has their own complexity and time limit.
