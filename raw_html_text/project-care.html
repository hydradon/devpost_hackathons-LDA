                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See a child begging on the streets? Would you give them 20 Rs. or would you rather give them a future?
After traveling and returning back to Pakistan, we realized that children begging on the streets is
                    <em>
                        not
                    </em>
                    normal. Only in Pakistan are these future doctors, engineers, and entreprenuers &mdash; being ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help eliminate this terrible practice, but imagine our surprise when we discovered that
the law already exists to curb it. This SDG Hackathon gave us the ability to use our technology for good.

                <p>
                    As a citizen of this country, and as a human-being you must ask yourself:
                    <strong>
                        Why are there children still begging on the streets?

                    Project C.A.R.E is a web application that helps responsible citizens report children that
they encounter begging on the streets. It guides them through a set of questions to ask, and the
appropriate actions to take to file a strong complaint, that the Child Protection &amp; Welfare Bureau
can use to take custody of and ultimately save the child.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built is using React.js optimized for fast prototyping via Gatsby.js. It took us
about 40% of our time planning the application itself, before we started coding. It
was stressful at times, but we persevered and finished it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time constraint is always a problem at hackathons. We started hoping to build packaged
iOS and Android applications with inbuilt recording capabilities that would render reports, and
give us leaderboards, and analytics but because of time constraints we built a client-side web application
that works with a large number of devices, but was fast to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hoped to create a back-end, but ultimately with only one technical engineer, that became
a challenge.

                    The app works, it's intuitive, it's beautiful, and we believe it'll be used regardless
of how it ranks in the hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're wonderful friends and we make a great team. We also learnt how to network, pitch, gamify our apps, and
we made a lot of new friends during the hackathon as well.
