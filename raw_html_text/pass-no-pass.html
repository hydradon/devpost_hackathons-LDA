                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team mate came up with a basic idea when he was having problem with his grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates and show user's current grade and possible future grades. It also can predict if the user will pass or not to pass his/her classes. It has a function to help contacting his/her professor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift on Xcode (finished)
Android Studio (unfinished)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with good algorithms. Fixing bugs that could make the app not working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can actually help many of students who are struggling with his or her school works.
As far as we know, there's not such mobile app that calculates student's current GPA and predict the pass/no pass.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating grades is actually a very complicated process that involves many different factors, such as different weights on assignments, curbing grades, dropping the lowest score, extra credit and so on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pass No Pass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing up the Android version.
And also making our app to be able to calculate with many different factors mentioned above, which we could not implement this time.
