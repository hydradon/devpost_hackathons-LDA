                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dream was to play vaporwave's most well known artist, Macintosh Plus, on my actual vintage Macintosh Plus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays what is probably the most popular song in vaporwave, リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュ, using the Macintosh Plus' built-in speakers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brian transcribed sheet music for リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュ into MusicWorks, the world's first computer-based music notation interface. The application, from 1984, is still remarkably modern, and it let us play the song with a computer-simulated kazoo, which is a huge plus. To amplify the sound, we plugged a speaker into the computer's 3.5mm audio jack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final implementation was largely different than the initial idea. I had hoped to transfer the actual Floral Shoppe sound files onto floppy disks and play them from the Macintosh speaker, but this was not technically feasible for a variety of reasons: the 800KB size of the floppies, the anemic 8MHz processor, and the lack of software support for any modern sound files. I was lucky to find sheet music for リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュ and someone who is well-versed in reading music notation, making the project possible.

                <p>
                    It's so meta

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With its window-based and mouse-driven interface, there's practically no learning curve for using this computer from the 1980s. Fascinating.

                    All of Floral Shoppe? Nah, probably not.
