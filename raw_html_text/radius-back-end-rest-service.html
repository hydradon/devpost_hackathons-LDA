                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Same as the RadiUS android app, since this is a supporting service.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a RESTful service that provides support for persistent data so that the android app can interact with other instances running on different phones.

                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Using IBM's bluemix development environment that works very well.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    It was my first time coding Node.js so keeping up with callbacks was an experience that helped me grow.
