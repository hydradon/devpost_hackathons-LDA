                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successful implementation of stock market predictions could make significant progress for any individual or overall country's economic progression. Personally, I was motivated to do this project cause my keen interest in investment market. In addition to that, experience with LSTM and forecasting time series is interesting to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, it takes data from year 2010 to 2016 to make stock price predictions for subsequent time-frame followed. 
Here the machine learning algorithm I choose after some experiments with moving average, ARIMA is LSTM. LSTM chooses what to forget and what to insert into memory, allow a network to choose a path to focus on in the visual field
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started the project with choosing appropriate dataset from kaggle
I then utilized python's packages for data wrangling and EDA
Studied some research papers and online resources for LSTM, statisitcs and stock price
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I decided to implement this projects using microsoft AzureML and data science virtual machine
However, after some rendering here and there I couldn't manage to run it without exhausting memory usage
I switched to jupyter notebook and keras afterwards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning more about LSTM and successfully implementing on selected dataset
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding why would one need to be able to predict stock price movements
Predicting and visualizing future stock market with current data and what potential impacts it could have
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for stock_prediction_LSTM ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could use most recent or live data to make this project more empirical and relevant
