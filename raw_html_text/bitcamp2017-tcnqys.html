                    Ever have one of those moments where you're just scrolling through the web and suddenly realize, "dang, my life really is so not dank enough." That can be a sad feeling, but don't worry with Meme-ify, you never have to experience those moments again! In just a click of a mouse, you can turn your whole page dank!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meme-ify is a Chrome Extension that allows you to "meme-ify" the current page that you are looking at. Essentially, it make your page dank. This fun, 'family-friendly" extension parses through the html content of your page and redirects all the image source links to a dank meme. This allows you to temporarily reconfigure your page to have all the dankness in one spot. The extension also plays dank music whenever you choose to turn your page into memes. Meme-ify is also completely consensual. Unlike many other extensions, Meme-ify does not force memes on you and does not automatically reconfigure your page without your permission. You have complete control over whether or not you want your page to become dank. The component is conveniently located on the extension toolbar in your Google Chrome Browser. Whenever you decide that you want to have some fun, you can push the button. Of course, once you click the button and enter the world of dank memes, you can't go back (not that you would ever want to) until you refresh the page.
