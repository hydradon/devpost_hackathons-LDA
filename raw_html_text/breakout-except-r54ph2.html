                    It's like one of those Bee Movie videos but in game form.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's breakout, but every 10 bricks broken, you have to play 25 points of snake but every 5 points, you play a 5 point game of pong, but for every point scored you play 10 seconds of Space Invaders.
