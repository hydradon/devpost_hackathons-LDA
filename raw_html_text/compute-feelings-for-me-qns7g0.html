                    We wanted to show that human emotion was fairly simple to capture from sound waves
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app listens to human speech using a microphone and converts the patterns generate into a set of emotions
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standing on the backs of giants! We used open-source software developed by a gentleman named Chris Wilson, web frameworks and available data on human emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into some major configuration errors along the way. We also switched topics about 20 hours into the hackathon, after realizing that all our anticipated predictive datasets for our initial project had trends that followed events rather than proceeding them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a server running our website, a solid idea and had a good time :).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Configuration and validation first, worry about the detail later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope to build in our own more robust visualization for Compute Feelings for Me. After that, the sky's the limit!
