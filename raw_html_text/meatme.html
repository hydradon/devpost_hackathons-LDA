                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the school year it is common to have group projects where scheduling becomes an issue. The common method to find a meeting time between members is to throw out random dates and times until you find a common one amongst the group. Obviously, this can be a long and tiring process and we thought that there must be a better way to handle this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows users to choose a range of dates that they are interested in meeting during. The app then finds the users that are closest to the person with the application and allows you to choose which of those members you would like to schedule the meeting with. From there it will parse the selected members calendars and find common times for all of you to meet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we set about designing a feature list and choosing which of those would be manageable to implement during the hackathon. Then we designed the user interfaces and decided which features each member would implement, if members encountered problems with the implementation we would create pair programming teams to ensure that they were given the help they needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was connecting the application with the server to authenticate the google sign in. This was a problem as Android did not like http connections and our server had issues with SSL certificates. This was by far the problem we spent the longest on throughout the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the application to find users that were close by to the user with the application was very challenging and rewarding. This feature was very key and we were glad to be able to integrate it.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that using existing technologies instead of designing our own server might have been a better idea. Examples of this are existing technologies like Firebase.io
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a large feature list we would like to implement in the future, some of those are the following:
-Machine learning to find the best dates
-Adding saved groups
-Adding users who are not close by
