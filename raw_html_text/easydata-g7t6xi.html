                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were fascinated by the challenge which was formulated by Sitra. At the very beginning we had no idea how to deal with this problem because all of us had never before faced such complex problems. We are interested in this topic because as a researchers we understand that sometimes when we are looking for some information, we cannot even now that any particular data source (that can be very useful and interesting for research) can exist. That is why we decided to take part in this challenge and get into the inspiring world of scientific data and innovation.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasyData is interactive catalogue for health and welfare data and tool for forming new innovative data combinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can search for any information and the tool gives show, which data exists. It creates an innovative playground of different data sets and connections between them, suggesting you new data sets you can use and where you can find it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It aggregates observations in different open data stores' datasets into simple metadata objects and allows to search in them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our proposal is each dataset from all the databases are aggregated to model which consists :
                </p>
                <p>
                    Origin
Title
Variables
Keywords
Language
                </p>
                <p>
                    When user inputs a search query, we make a search on Title, Variables and Keywords and present the results retrieved.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a mockup service with ruby on rails, deployed it on azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges to understand what different APIs deliver to user and how to get it all to common ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came with a plan to unite various public APIs which provide statistical data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned about data available from public datasets and what kind of information they deliver in Finland.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasyData
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool can be used not only for health and welfare data but also in other fields of science.
Also, next step is connecting EasyData for various different data sources that will give the wide choices, relevant and precise information and easy understanding of innovative data combinations for users.
