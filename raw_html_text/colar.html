                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this product because of the prevalence of colorblindness in the general population, as well as the widespread use of colorblind tests that unfairly targeted this subset of the population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ColAR will scan an image of a colorblindness test and tell you the resulting number it represents. That way, even colorblind people are able to take the colorblind tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using swift in Xcode over the period of 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SInce it was my first time using swift, I was diving into everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that the app works and does what it is supposed to do, considering that swift is completely new to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of swift programming and how to make an iOS app.
                </p>

                    What's next for ColAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be expanding this product to also assist colordeaf people to allow them to hear colors as well.
