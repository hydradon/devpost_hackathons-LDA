                    Our inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe everyone should feel secure when walking home at night. As girls, we were constantly told to be cautious rather than confident, particularly when walking alone on the streets. Unfortunately, caution while traveling alone is often justified. Our team immediately connected over this topic when it was brought up while brainstorming. This fear was something we were all familiar with and something we wanted to to fix. Thus, we decided to create a meaningful and practical app that we have all needed at one point in our lives.

                <p>
                    SafeRoute was conceived as an app that takes public, open source data from various cities cross referencing it with Google Map's APIs to map out the safest and fastest routes to and from any destination in NYC. The app we ended up making is two fold: part of it utilizes Google Map's API to map out multiple routes between one location and the other. The other part also uses the API to analyze data obtained from

                    </a>
                    to mark the locations of crimes reported throughout the city and group them into clusters so that users can see where crime is reported often.

                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working primary with JavaScript, a programming language that most of us were unfamiliar with. Additionally, we faced challenges integrating JS into the AngularJS framework. Our crime cluster map was written in JS and used jQuery to query data from NYC OpenData. We were unable to integrate the crime cluster map onto the map showing the routes and directions.
