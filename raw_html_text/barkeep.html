                    barkeep is a container that works just like an hourglass, limiting liquid flow by increments of time. Practically, this means that your bar night will result in perfectly-paced libation.

                    One of the biggest dangers of college life is binge drinking. The barkeep is calibrated to pour your drink from one chamber to another at thirty minute intervals, using the same two chambers and bottleneck that a traditional hourglass has.

                    Using Solidworks and with the help of the great volunteers at Citris, I designed from scratch a 3D model that would have the sufficient volume and flow rate to meet the time aims. The sheer time it took to print it and the dozens of other simultaneous print requests meant I had only one chance to do a mini-prototype, as opposed to multiple trials and errors.

                    This was my first 3D hack, and I'm excited to apply the knowledge I learned about 3D modeling and manipulation in the near future both at hackathons and as a hobby. It is not as daunting as I first thought, and the process can be incredibly gratifying when you finally see your mind's design come to life.
