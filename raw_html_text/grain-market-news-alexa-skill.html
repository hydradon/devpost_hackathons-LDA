                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way for farmers to be able to keep up with news relevant to their profession without the hassle of pulling out a phone or computer. This skill allows Amazon Alexa owners to add news about the global grain market to their flash briefing so they can get news hands-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill imports an RSS feed about grain market news (currently limited to Australia)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Amazon Alexa developer console and flash briefing preset, and added an automatic-updating RSS feed url to it. The flash briefing preset automatically adds functionality for the voice commands needed and a text-to-speech feature that reads the feed out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an RSS feed that worked seamlessly with the console or attempting to create our own feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill was certified by Amazon so it is now available for download anywhere.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create Amazon Alexa skills that I will use in the future to create more complex skills for my own use.
