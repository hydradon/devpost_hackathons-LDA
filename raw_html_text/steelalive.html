                <p>
                    No one works 24/7, but issues can occur at your company when you least expect it. At ArcelorMittal Dofasco, navigating the database of incidence reports can be both difficult and inconvenient. We aim to create a web app that is focused on formatting information so that is both conveniently located and easy to read.

                    We used Python to make calls to Dofasco's Service-Now API and as well as the language for the database sorting backend. HTML, CSS, Javascript, the Django web framework, and Bootstrap is used to create the website's front end for flexible display across all platforms,
