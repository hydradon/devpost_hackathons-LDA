                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time registering for clubs and joining projects that we are interested in as first-year students. Club application, especially, is a long, painful process that can be simplified with an organized network, ease-to-use network. As project leaders, such as startup founders, we also had a hard time looking for people with specific interests and skills to join our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to post about their clubs/programs/events for other students to join/apply.
Each user has a profile that contains information such as profile picture, interests, skill sets, his/her own project, and the projects she/he joined.

                    used android-studio, and firebase

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    none of us knew android/firebase before, we are first-year students with limited computer science background, and we made a functional app with database
