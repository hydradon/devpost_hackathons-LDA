                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I play table tennis at the national level and I would like an accurate way to keep the score of the match and have fun.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It records points for each player using a simple and easy to grasp method. The arrow keys record points for separate players, and control and shift allow the user to remove accidentally given points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google cloud to host the website, and we used 4 different languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python) to code for separate parts of the code. The HTML and CSS were used to code the templates and to make the website aesthetically appealing. Python handled most of the backend of the program, while JavaScript was used for the remainder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't sure how to transport code from HTML and CSS to JavaScript to position the text correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to edit pictures for the website using editing software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage time well and divide our responsibilities between education, assignments, and interests.
                </p>

                    What's next for Scorekeeper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to add a score keeping function for more sports such as basketball, football, etc. Also we will make it look more professional.
