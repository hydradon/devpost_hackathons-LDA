                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Engineers, the thing we are most known for is avoiding work. We felt that cutting millions of wires, at varying length from a spool, was too tedious. So, we decided to automate the process!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be able to cut any gauge wire at any desired length. User input will be required for the specified length.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wood to build the frame. We used a motor, ball bearings, and 3D printed parts to create the feeder and cutting systems. We used the Particle Argon kit as our micro controller.  This allows us to use our Smart Wire as an IoT connected device!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a design for the framework and the system that would allow the most efficient demonstration for our project idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a full hardware project that is IoT connected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage tasks and deal with hardware problems efficiently given time and resource constraints.  Because hardware design is much more difficult, slower, and more permanent, we had to plan most of our cuts and assemblies ahead of time, and still leave enough time to execute on those plans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Wire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate wire stripping along with cutting to our design
