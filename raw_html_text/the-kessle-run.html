                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of randomness was fantastic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a space shooter, it creates obstacles making it harder for you to upgrade your ship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, React-Native, and a few algorithms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't know unity, didn't know react
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a flushed out game with interaction with a mobile app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of c#, and async calling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Kessle Run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole bunch of stuff. We need to fix how enemy ships appear, we wanted them to "warp" in with some light, but they just froze. Also the game is pretty beefy, so it does need to be optimized. Lots of rendering objects, and more focus on integrating the app into the game.
