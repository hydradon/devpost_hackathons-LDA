                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Mom likes to go to sleep listening to TED Talks.  But often, the talks are so exciting that they don't help her go to sleep.  They keep her up!  So, I thought: what is the most boring thing that one can listen to, and I thought: the low voice of a man reading something about taxes, and the voice fades away gradually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads a piece of tax legislation in the voice of a man, and t he voice very slowly fades away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a simple skill to build.  Audio that starts playing, and that then pauses to ask the user very gently if they are still there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 90 second limitation is too short.  I wish we could do like 3 minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea and its simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if you pay attention to the circumstances, you can come up with ideas that are useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Sleeping Bill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more variation of what the skill says.  Also, we want to find a way to play a stream of audio that is more than 90 seconds.
