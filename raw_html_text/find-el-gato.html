                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved the interactive videos that utilized a 360 video and your phones sensors to navigate said video. Because we're all learning new languages (non-digital that is) we figured we could make a cute game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently our project allows you to select between several languages, and then start a game. It posts an objective like Find el gato. You have to search the image for el gato and click it. It'll tell you if you were wrong or right and then changed the objective.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the full 24 hours (much pain, much sadness) we built the code completely in Android Studio. We tried looking through several API's and a few SDK's to get the tools we needed to make our dream a reality because the purpose of the hackathon was to shoot high and learn new things. We learned a ton, it just wasn't how to make a 360 panoramic photo or how to maneuver said photo with position sensors. Ultimately we were unable to utilize any of them and so we then proceeded to use the last 6 hours of our hackathon to hard code the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in with very little coding experience as a group of mostly aerospace/mechanical engineers we had plenty of challenges. The biggest was finally making the call to stop researching for solutions and change our problem into something do-able.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pushed code to our phone, made an app, had some clickable buttons. That is pretty cool in our book and we look forward to doing some more android development.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUUUUUUUCH! So much pain for so very little pragmatic knowledge. But Edison first learned 1000 ways to not make a lightbulb. That's what we did, we discovered a 1000 ways to not make the app we wanted. Until we finally made an app worth demoing.

                <p>
                    We'll decide that after we've slept for at least 8 hours straight.
