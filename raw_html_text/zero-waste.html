                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorrectly sorted garbage is costing Canada's recycling programs millions of dollars per year. Furthermore, Canada is struggling to meet the standard for the amount of contamination in recyclables set by China (0.5%), the world's biggest importer of recyclable materials. All of these are costing Canada's economy a huge amount of resources which can be instead used for developing other services such as healthcare and transportation systems.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend image classification is based on Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services Custom Vision API. The front end is built using JavaScript, HTML5, Angular JS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no experience in front end developing such as JavaScript, Angular JS. It took us a lot of time to pick up these different languages within short period of time. Also, Azure's Cognitive Services API doesn't not recognize HTTP request in Python and it's c# library is still in development with many failing library functions, so we had to consider alternative ways to make HTTP request.
                </p>
