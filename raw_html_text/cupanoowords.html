                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Microstrategy's hyper-intelligence cards, which would provide data on mouse hover over certain key words or phrases, and wanted to see how we could apply such an idea to other fields. We thought about how useful such info-cards would be in education for allowing students to hover over certain words or concepts to learn more about what they mean or do. A very obvious example would be in learning new languages, where students could be given a passage containing certain vocabulary words and such words could have these info-cards to let students easily get such information rather than having to look it up on Google Translate or a dictionary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it allows users to input a block of text, searches for words in our databases, which acts like a simple dictionary containing the words' parts of speech and definition, and attaches a card to each word found that becomes visible once a user hovers over it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the Django Web Development Framework since two of our members were already familiar with using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to have some log-in feature to have user-specific data about which words they would hover over more frequently to track some data, but unfortunately we were unable to get that working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to create cards similar to how Microstrategy's Hyperintelligence extension does was really cool and learning how to integrate such cards with our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to apply the Django framework and Bootstrap components into a new and unfamiliar application. We also learned how to parse text inputs and inject html code within to make certain words have special css properties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CupaNooWords
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to figure out the login situation, but also would like to implement a testing feature that would track how often users would hover over certain words and would test them on words they hover more frequently over. We would also like to display some analytics on words that they struggled on to. Another feature that would be useful would be for, say, an admin to upload a dictionary file that the app would parse and put into the database.
