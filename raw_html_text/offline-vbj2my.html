                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students take internet accessibility for granted, but for many low-income students across the United States, internet accessibility is not always available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application acts as a search engine that, when students are online, can easily download articles on any topic, that can then be easily accessed with a quick touch without internet access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application contains an entire full-stack: A UI, a REST API, web scraper, and a python script to store files. The UI contains a comforting design, a search bar,etc... When a user searches a topic in the search bar, a request is made with the REST API, which then leads to a web scraper that downloads the information into a file that can easily be accessed offline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us had different skills, and did not know each other. We were all learning different frameworks, languages, and skills from each other in order to complete the project. We all had to be in full focus in order to learn these skills, and we needed to learn how to stay organized as a team. We needed to divide up the tasks in order to conquer this project. Although many of us knew git/github before this, we learned how to stay organized by efficiently using github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created exactly what we planned to create. We've all had stories of when the project we've been working on doesn't come out how we expect, but not in this case. We were all very proud to see the project we've spent countless,sleepless hours on, working well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a combination of hard and soft skills. Frameworks/libraries/languages such as React, Flask,git were learned throughout the project, but also our organizational/teamwork skills. We learned/improved on that, even when the project gets complicated, we need to stay organized and divide the tasks in order to complete the goals we set for ourselves.

                    What's next for OffLearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OffLearn has great potential in the marketplace. Many students face obstacles and disadvantages because of their lack of internet access. While internet may cost money, information should be free for anybody. OffLearn's goal is to make that a reality.
