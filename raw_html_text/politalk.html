                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by the polar nature of this past year's election.  We want to connect people and allow them to discuss opposing political views so that people can regain a sense of humanity for those with differing opinions and values.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project links people with different political views through a chat app.  We use a natural language processing toolkit to analyze the sentiment in messages in an attempt to minimize hatred and harassment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With code. And passion.  And pain.
                </p>

                    Many many bugs.
