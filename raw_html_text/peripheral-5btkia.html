                    Look in the direction that you wish to travel towards.

                    If you are looking at an inter-actable object in the game, you can tell by the circle in the center of the player's view becoming filled.

                <p>
                    Peripheral forces players to be aware of where they're looking in VR. Depending on the direction and duration of gaze, it can help or hinder progress toward solving challenging puzzles.

                    Unity3d, OVR SDK, Raycasting, 3d cubes, almost no texturing (solid colours), physics.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <h3>
                    Performance on GearVR
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The GearVR has minor performance hiccups in several spots in the game, though thankfully never during critical points. We've spent a lot of time tuning the game to keep the framerate high, no matter what you're looking at. While being a tremendous piece of kit, the dynamic CPU and GPU throttling due to heat is a real bummer.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Integrating common control schemes using Oculus camera
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make sure the game felt great to play on a GearVR whether or not you're using the touch pad.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Handling raycast and player movement
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Because the core gameplay element is based upon the user's gaze direction, we had to make sure this worked perfectly with the prebuilt GearVR Unity3d assets.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    How fun it is. We've created a puzzle game which leverages head-tracking in VR rather than just being a gimmick.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Tons! Unity3d has native support for VR; Oculus SDK is not required, how to do remote profiling in VR on Android, and how to tell if your game is running sub-optimally with time warping.

                    Continued optimization, scaling level size for viewing in VR, puzzle design, gameplay videos.
