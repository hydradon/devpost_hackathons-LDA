                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In university, we have many transactions that we need to book keep, whether it is mass orderings for supper or just occasional lack of cash during lunchtime. It is troublesome to remember these transactions, and perhaps to some, even more troublesome to book keep through an mobile application that one has to download. One of our team members keeps track of these transactions through I.O.Us (I Owe You) via text messaging, giving us the idea that a Telegram bot may just be the perfect solution for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks who owes you money and who you owe money to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Telegram API written in Python wrappers, along with sqlite for database storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    python syntax is very different from javascript and java which we are more used to. Additionally, getting everyone to concurrently do work without dependency on each other was difficult in this project, which resulted in a lot of down time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have managed to pick up python, the knowledge of how Telegram works and some sql database knowledge in just 24 hours (no prior experience).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important to plan out the workflow of the project early on, so that each member can effectively utilise his/her time doing components independently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PayBobBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to implement the remaining features as well as to incorporate the Telegram keyboard responses into the "GUI". Additionally, we also hope to bring in online payments to settle payments through the bot.
