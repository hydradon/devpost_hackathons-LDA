                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 250 million people around the world are visually impaired. While many tools have been developed for visual impairment assistance, we noticed that they could be further improved. Our goal for this project was to create a versatile system for users to navigate through their environment and 'see' the world as it really is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designed to stream images and videos from a portable IoT camera device to a Java Backend server which processes and uses Google's Vision API to detect objects and text within the picture. From there, the server uploads it to Firebase, which is accessed by the iOS app and notifies the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wifi shield for the camera microprocessor is not available and therefore we had to manually send to Java server, which uploads to Firebase server and then to iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eye-OT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future add-ons for our project will include a more robust portable device, as well as additional image analyzation features, such as text reading, danger sense, tracking and face recognition. Future developments for the portable device could include mounting on an autonomous unmanned drone vehicle.
