                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health is important for academic success and well being.  We crafted HealthySlug for fellow new year resolution slugs  by providing an easy way to follow several healthy diets: basic, paleo, keto, and bulking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HealthySlug recommends healthy diet abiding foods options depending on desired meal and dining hall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We classified menu information scraped from the UCSC dining hall website using an algorithm comparing carb-fat-protein ratios.  Using Google Firebase's real-time database, we linked the foods to an android studio app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to use Google Firebase database to share data to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulling each individual component together to make a coherent app! We learned a lot about scraping the web, parsing that data into useable types, nutrition plans based on certain health goals, using a database to communicate with an app front-end, and making a front-end UI with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing software in a team can be challenging and good communication is key to success.

                    What is next for HealthySlug
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing personal profiles for tracking daily values and calories count.
