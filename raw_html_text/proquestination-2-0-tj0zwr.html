                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed something to do and this had failing horribly at Mhacks 8, so I decided to restart from scratch and do it justice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to add and remove tasks to complete and keeps track of how much you are procrastinating.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used mostly html and javascript to build it mainly out of divs and buttons
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the buttons to work every time they stopped working.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how javascript and html interact and also that buttons are finicky.
