                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tells us how many parking spots are available and it breaks it down by floor for us.

                    We built it using Android Studio for the front end and Eclipse for the back end.

                    We were able to fully put together an app with full integration in the short time that we had by combining our individual experiences to contribute and make our team as efficient as possible.
