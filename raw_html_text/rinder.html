                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After always struggling to find where to go with our friends, we thought of making an app to help make our decisions for where to eat and places to explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it gives users the option to look through different entertainment locations and provides the address along with an option to call the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to build the app, Node.js for the back end and used Yelp API for extracting data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with React was new for some of the team members, so they had a very steep learning curve to work with. We were having issues with the asynchronous API calls and with designing the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the hackathon, we were mostly inexperienced with React, but we were able to learn fast and implement some basic features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Invaluable experience working with React (HTML and CSS), git and debugging.
(Also that ping pong is really fun!)
                </p>

                    What's next for Rinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the UI more refined and turning it into a mobile app, along with adding more settings so users can customize their experience.
