                <p>
                    Open XC can detect vehicle speed and GPS monitoring, offering future possibilities to expand with comp&aacute;s. This data can be collected from the vehicles of featured drivers and relay the data back to comp&aacute;s. A speed average can caution travelers of driving patterns, while a geolocation ping can notify users if their preferred driver is close by.

                    There are many ways that comp&aacute;s helps travelers save time by making it easy to find a reliable and safe mode of transportation. The efficiency of Maps and Routes save users money on travel expenses for public transportation by finding the most direct route, cutting down on total travel time.

                        Does comp&aacute;s provide value for transportation providers?
                    </strong>
                    At its core, comp&aacute;s gathers and distributes data for transportation routes, stops, and schedules in a way that is easy to comprehend. So its not just useful to travelers but providers as well. The review system implemented for finding a driver encourages ridership using crowd sourced data. Integrating maps with key destinations and collected data to transportation providers offers a guide to both public and private providers. The utilization of geo-location services via Google keeps the process of managing data simple and easily accessible from desktop or mobile devices.

                    RTP Metrobus Lines Map (used for public transportation), ECOBICI Eco-Bike information (used for public transportation), ViaDF (used for private, public, and shared transportation), Uber Drivers (created a user review platform to accommodate shared transportation).

                        ROUTES
                    </strong>
                    - Looking up a route can be a daunting task due to the sheer amount of information that exists online. By pulling data directly from sources like ViaDF, ECOBICI Eco-Bike, or RTP Metrob&uacute;s Lines, users can save time and avoid the hassle. Instant search results aid travelers in finding exactly what they need within seconds, greatly increasing the efficient use of multi-modal transportation by Mexico City consumers. Management is also easy for transportation providers to track routes, stops, and schedules with comp&aacute;s by importing tabular data. Notifications can be sent directly from users to the transportation the provider if a route is outdated. Routes delivers a flexible method to organize a heavy amount of information across multiple types of transportation available in Mexico city, helping users access on-demand routing to plan their trip. This feature can also be expanded easily using excel or csv files, making mass imports effortless.

                        MAPS
                    </strong>
                    - Travelers benefit from sorting hundreds of routes to help make an informed decision, but visualizing a route also helps in a big way. RTP Metrob&uacute;s Lines maps are pulled directly from Google and organized for the user in one place.  It also makes things easier for users that prefer using their google app by adding a link to save them the hassle. Eco-Bike maps are also pulled directly from Google, with additional options such as downloadable PDFs for offline use. Maps provides on-demand wayfinding features to encourage the use of efficient multi-modal transportation in Mexico City by a route, using the latest data available. Since the location for public transportation is generated on comp&aacute;s via Google, map management is painless for transportation providers to handle bus lines with comp&aacute;s by updating everything from one location. Notifications can also be sent directly from users to a transportation provider if a location has changed.
