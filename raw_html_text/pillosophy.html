                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most current apps involve patients putting in the information themselves instead of having doctors provide that information.
Two major barriers for patients taking their medication are them forgetting to take them as well as medications being cost-prohibitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users have a check box for their daily meds which they check after taking the medication. Most people have a problem of the initial motivation. This would help with that motivation to take their medication, as well as the reward of a small discount.
                </p>

                    Future plans

                <p>
                    Integration with HL7 and MyChart. Intended to complement MyChart and not replace it. Implementation with MyChart would 
increase ease of use for doctors as it would automatically pull data from mychart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Increase security/privacy in order to be HIPPA-compliant
