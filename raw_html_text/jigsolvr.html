                    What inspires us?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first hackathon for every member of our team, we were inspired to push our learning to the limits and try to create something truly out of the ordinary. Yes, we were inspired to complete our project but more so to be enveloped by the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does our project do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out on our mission attempting to make puzzles more enjoyable to the everyday person, and that's exactly what JigSolvr does. We accomplish this in two major parts. The first of which is an algorithm that takes a picture of the completed puzzle (I.E. The picture on the box) and also a specific piece of the puzzle. It is then able to determine where in the larger puzzle the smaller piece is located. The second part is the mechanical aid to the algorithm. The user is able to place a piece into the robot's tray where it is photographed, and given to the algorithm described above. Once it's location is known, the robot brings it to the correct location in the puzzle and drops it, allowing for easy completion of the puzzle for the user.

                    How was it developed?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team of four was split down the middle for most of the weekend, with two coders and two mechanical designers. The algorithm had many different layers

                    ![(as seen on our github page!)], and continued to grow throughout the hackathon. The same triumphs can be quoted for our robotic piece, as 3D printing, electrical engineering, and other new talents were successfully put to the test.

                <h2>
                    Were there challenges?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges we faced throughout the development of our project ranging from coding standstills to lacking access to hardware goods. Yes, many of these setbacks did impact our project and led to its finished project, but never did a setback cause us to rethink the importance of the project we were making. Some if not most of our challenges stuck with us until hacking ended, leading to an imperfect ending to our project. Although there were more things we wish we could have gotten done, our performance was still highly aggressive given the time frame allotted.

                    Accomplishments that our team is proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We almost finished. Two days ago we came in with an idea we only thought to take a chip out of. We did that and a whole lot more, finishing with differences ranging from hardware to new knowledge. To put it frankly, we should be asleep right now. But we're still here and looking at our computer screens until the minute this document is submitted. That's something we're proud of.

                    What's next for JigSolvr?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we have no concrete plans for JigSolvr, we are still interested in smoothing the cracks between the code and the hardware we developed at this event. All of our team truly believe that this was an accomplishment for us as hackers and for the hackathon as a whole. It was a pleasure hacking alongside an organization such as HackUMass, and we look forward to joining again next year.
