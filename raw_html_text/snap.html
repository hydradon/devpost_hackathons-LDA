                    At 11am on Tuesday, tune into Snap for the best offers for what you can get up to next weekend.
Anybody can browse through hundreds of tabs; Snap is an opinionated way of browsing just five "good" options only for "next weekend". User preferences, home airport, budget and other stored preferences are factored into a simple "snap choice".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This overturns the normal flight search process. Instead of picking

                <p>
                    ... Snap will just assume dates and home airport and show a list of great value destinations, found by the Skyscanner "everywhere" search. We combine hotel and other deals around this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To sweeten the display of results, we show the value of your home neighborhood on AirBnB (powered by Zilyo API) as a cost-saving for a weekend getaway: A &euro;500 trip might only cost &euro;300!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we generate these 5 options, they can be shared with a travel companion as a shared challenge. Voted separately, the results are shared afterwards and booking can then take place for your common choice. Booking would be eventually via Skyscanner and Hotelbeds.
