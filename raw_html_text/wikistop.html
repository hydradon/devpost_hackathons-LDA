                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a travel enthusiast,  I love the idea of being informed about the cool places, which appeal to my interest. Usually Google Maps fail to give me a clear picture of the places I should visit and that is what inspired us to make an interactive tool which could make our future trips amazing.

                    WikiStops is an interactive tool, capable of maintaining a database of all the beautiful yet infamous places around the world. It uses the concept of WikiPedia and Poke-Stops and interacts with the user.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an iOS app with the APIs of more than one company was a challenge to begin with. We used the estimate API to set up our base map and Geo tagging features. On top of which we super imposed the Watson's API for an interactive speech to text and text to speech guide. Furthermore, we used Xcode version 8.2.1's latest features in order to bring our app together.

                    What's next for WikiStop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently as a demo we have five locations and due to  limitation of being within the pavilion we could not tag anything  but a building. The scope that we see for this app includes the possibility of having subsections with different kinds of WikiStops, for example one for photography spots, one for historical buildings and so on. Furthermore, this could also include Watson's alchemy features to help create a like minded, better educated and more positive community.
