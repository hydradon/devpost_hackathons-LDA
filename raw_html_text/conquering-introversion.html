                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect the world.
From the multiple 24-hour libraries to language tutors and math question centers, Harvard College does a lot to support their student's education. However, one area that the college lacks in providing students with enough support is with providing the student body with a platform to find other studying for their same classes and form study groups from those people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows students to indicate which classes they are taking and which ones they are currently studying for (or want to be studying for). Then, the user will be prompted with a map showing the locations of other students who are studying for the class at that same time and are also looking for a study partner. This notion of location matching with people based on what class you want to study for can be expanded more broadly to people looking to find people in the area with similar interests as them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One unique feature is it automatically pairs you with peers via geolocation based on your interests. The user only adds interests in our algorithm does the matches and will send a notification with a suggested "Meeting Location". Later on we plan on implementing the confirmation of the meeting functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recorded a live demo of the application running on an iPhone Xs to display these features.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift, python, google cloud, and Firebase.
                </p>

                    200 but to name a few: Design and swift integration and GitHub file limits.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is really cool. We believe this can be used in multiple settings, not only universities, to make people find partners to study or to hangout.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to connect swift to firebase and we learned how to get GPS location from the phone using CoreLocation. We also learned about implementing apple maps into an ios application and how to create annotations on the map. As well as integration with Apple notifications using Firebase.
