                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured that monitoring of human emotions in real-time can be very beneficial for everyone to pick up a few extra social skills. Knowing what other people are feeling through facial expressions can be a more accurate assessment than listening as not everyone opens their hearts freely! Also, additional cuteness in the world never hurts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to tag and render images and videos with cute emoticons based on emotions on people's faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just a few functions written in python that uses the Microsoft Emotion API to add emoticons to faces in images, videos and webcam streams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had zero experience with programmatic handling of videos; in fact, you could call me a relative newb in python. I had to learn everything from scratch and overnight in a team of only 1 person who writes code after the third never returned. Nonetheless, we managed to get to exactly the product we set out to create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refer to point above. We think that the final results are rather entertaining to watch, especially the rendered videos (see youtube)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton of image and video handling tricks in python and opencv. A thorough reviewer of the code would notice my extremely incoherent use of image libraries - it will be fixed.
                </p>

                    What's next for stickerface
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining emotions we can detect and optimizing the code for many of the rendering parts.
