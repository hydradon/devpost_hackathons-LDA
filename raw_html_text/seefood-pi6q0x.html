                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by Silicon Valley Season 4
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to take a picture of food and gives back a list of recipe of how to make the item
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with the Google Cloud Vision API and Endamam Recipe API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble setting up the Cloud Vision API and learning how to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am glad that the Android Application works in the end to a certain accuracy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Cloud API in junction with other API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SeeFood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeeFood hopefully will evolve into a Tinder of Food where users could swipe right or left to learn how to cook certain food with the set out target of certain calories or other nutritional values
