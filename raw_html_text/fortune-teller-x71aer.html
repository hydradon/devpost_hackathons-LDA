                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While I was just a wee boy, I had a dream to tell the fortunes of everyone who asked. This website does it for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The User logs in and gets a fortune. They then have the option to sign up to receive daily text messages with a fortune to liven up their day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a React Web App implementing Authentication and Subscriptions with MongoDB. I also created a node.js backend that accepts REST api requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge was getting the Domain.com domain to work correctly. However, this task was mute compared to debugging a CORS http error in which the issue wasn't even with CORS at all but the fact that I am using a trial version of Twilio which limits the numbers that I can text.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the middleware working between the frontend and backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB is easier to work with than I first imagined. It has a lot of great features built in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fortune Teller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fortune Teller will take over the world.
