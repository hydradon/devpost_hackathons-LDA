                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to try working with an API and using OAUTH with ML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to pull logged in customer data from a quickbooks account and determine relationships between periods of high spending and the sort of person prone to that kind of spending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was written in node.js and express.js. The quickbooks npm repository was very helpful. Machine learning was supposed to play a part, but I wasn't capable of integrating it sufficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was my first time using javascript on the backend, I ran into issues compiling the project because I wasn't handling asynchronous operations properly. Because of that I wasn't able to correctly integrate ML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully using OAuth 2 and basic MVC architecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about async javscript
                </p>

                    What's next for Intuit API - Customer Data Trends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully getting async to work and subsequently processing the data with some machine learning models and displaying it using some visual framework like react.js.
