                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot's of baseball fans like to travel to new baseball stadiums. Ideally we'd get to them all, but that can take years. How to pick where to go next?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app recommends new stadiums to visit based on where you've been before. Unlike most other recommendation services, this app recommends stadiums most unlike where you've been so you can diversify your experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core components are built off the basics of another app I created to recommend countries, but stadiums required gathering and processing new data as well as developing a different method for visualizing recommendations.
