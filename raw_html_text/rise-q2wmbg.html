                    "I was on Reddit the other day, and I saw someone mention that they had to wait several weeks before they could talk to a counselor on campus. A friendly Redditor responded, telling the person that they could pm them any time they needed to talk to someone. The user mentioned how helpful it was, and I realized how crucial it was to have an IMMEDIATE response. And what if that user didn't have to look on multiple platforms, but there was a single place they could find their clinical pathway and resources that they needed? And what better than an app, accessible to so many through just by a quick tap on a phone?" &ndash; Varsha Senthil

                    "In the past year, there have been 3 student suicides at the University of Toronto in the Bahen Centre. After hearing about health++ with the recent events at UofT, I was inspired to create something that could foster a greater sense of community among students and counselors alike. I wanted to create a difference in improving the mental health of students, while also learning something new." &ndash; Shanine Despacio

                    Rise provides a community for people to feel at home and free to discuss with other people who may feel the same way. It gives people the opportunity to take their wellness into their own hands and empower themselves, while providing resources to guide them on their clinical pathway.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off on pen and paper to build or app, and learned how to use Figma, learning loads about UI and data architecture for the first time! We also worked out different pathways a user could take at each step to make the app as inclusive of any situation a user may face, and we will continuously learn and add more as we grow.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It was our first time doing anything related to app development, so we had a lot of fun learning about UI and data architecture. Figuring out the business model took a lot of research and brainstorming as well.

                <p>
                    We are SUPER proud of what we've learned this weekend and how everything came together on Figma. It was so cool to see things we pictured in our head come alive and have a user friendly interface just like apps we see on our phone.

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about app development, UI, data architecure, and different business models. Each concept had so many possibilities that we had to look into and research and understand before making decisions.

                    We will be using Webflow, UX and React Native to code our app. We will contact mental health organizations both on campus and off campus to partner with as well.
