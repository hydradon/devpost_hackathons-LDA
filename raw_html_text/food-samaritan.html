                    Tackling Food Insecurity in Texas by incentivizing businesses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects restaurants that have excess food inventory and with local homeless shelters nearby. When restaurants enter the market value and cost of raw materials for their donations (this is generally kept in track of anyway to monitor profit margins), they are notified of their potential tax deductible.

                    XCode, Nodejs, Firebase, JavaScript, Swift

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nodejs Frustrations, Cloud Firebase Beta is not optimized for Swift, Billing was not enabled (lost two hours of time)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a working app that&rsquo;s powered by a cloud backend. Fully working microservice behind application. Developed formula to calculate tax deductible for business after reading through IRS documents. Developed verification system based off of publicly available IRS data that recognized legitimate charitable organizations for the purpose of tax deductions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The large scope of food insecurity in Texas (and America more broadly) despite us being a highly developed society.

                <p>
                    Building a sophisticated cross-verification system between shelter administrators and restaurant managers. More research into the legal implications of donating food inventory.
