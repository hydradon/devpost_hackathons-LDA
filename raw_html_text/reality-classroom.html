                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tyler has a VR compatible phone and my little brother only pays attention in school when he's entertained so we decided to fix that problem
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a VR app that has a nice galaxy scenery which allows children to engage in Astronomy and Computer science by hovering over the word. For Astronomy, majority of the solar system was displayed in 360 mode with a fun fact allowing students to be highly engaged. It also teaches students how to count in binary
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we built it with C#, Unity, VR sdk, and redbull.

                        too
                    </strong>
                    many problems, our ideas were constantly road block because of VR support and lack of tutorials
