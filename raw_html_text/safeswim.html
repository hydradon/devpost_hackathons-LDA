                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year 360000 die by drowning. One of our friend almost died from drowning. This idea is inspired from him.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have build a monitoring system that keep tracks of people who are swimming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built a machine learning model that identifies swimming, drowning and other activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This system is also extended to monitor people who are suffering from epilepsy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The model is further trained on people who suffer from seizures and tries to alert emergency helpline.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We leveraged the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors attached to arduino board which provides us with yaw, pitch and roll data. This data is fed to a machine learning algorithm with an activity label. The model is trained on data thus collected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We created a node.js server that runs the machine learning model and listens to further input from the sensors. Based on which it predicts the activity of the person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The monitoring is done through a webapp that listens to the prediction data sent by the server. (You will see the magic)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Connecting the sensors to arduino board and sending the data via bluetooth module was a bit tedious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data sent was not a continuous chunk but was data with bits and pieces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a system to collect the data to train the model took some time.

                        The system actually works with model accuracy around 88%.

                    <li>
                        We managed to collect sufficient data to train the model.

                    <li>
                        We also managed to predict with real time data.
