                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give people with difficulty hearing the option to experience music in a new way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program converts a given song or audio file into an abstract piece of art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using 16bit PCM-Signed .WAV files, we split the two stereo channels and get the separate frequency bands from each. Using these frequency bands, we draw out a scene on a canvas until a full image is created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decoding audio files into a workable format was a huge challenge. We were forced to learn and use Fast Fourier transform to convert the samples into their respective bands.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about audio and how it works is a new field of computer science for us and it was great fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to handle audio files and convert the data within them into visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Visuaudio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate 3D scenes with the image generator. Right now we are limited to 2D, but 3D is a stretchgoal. We would also like to convert this program into a workable app that can take the user's music and create abstract wallpapers for their phone.
