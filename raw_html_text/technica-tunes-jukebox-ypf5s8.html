                    Transport yourself back to the 50's using this JukeBox and relax to some songs of your choice. This downloadable JukeBox was created using the team&rsquo;s previous knowledge of Java, specifically using JavaFX to implement the GUI. Additionally, they integrated skills in HTML, css, and JavaScript that they learned through the Technica Workshops to create a demo website containing a downloadable version of the JukeBox.

                    This Jukebox was created by Sahana Raju, Selena Alvarado, Lauren Kosub, Kaitlin Leung, and Rachel Walter. All five students are freshmen at the University of Maryland and are enrolled in the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students Honors College Program. Technica is their first hackathon, and they look forward to more projects in the future!
