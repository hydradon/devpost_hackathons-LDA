                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a summer job at a retirement home. Seeing groups of seniors all perform the same activities with a wide range of results, and in some cases even hurting them. We knew there was a better way.

                    Detects the joint motions of the hands and bones with the LEAP-motion camera.

                    More statistics and data to improve personalized exercise routines which will best lead to a full recovery. Need more data, doctors, and research in order for this vision to become a reality.
