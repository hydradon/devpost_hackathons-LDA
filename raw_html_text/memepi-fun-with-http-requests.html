                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was really stuck on ideas and, as a joke, I told my friend that I should make a database for memes. I gave up on that dream quickly but it got me thinking about HTTP requests. I kept experimenting and I found I was well on my way to making an HTTP sandbox. This will appeal people who are curious and want to experiment with HTTP and all it has to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MemePI can be used to make simple REST APIs, examen API and online documents/scripts with get requests, and make/examen post requests. The API viewing component is probably the most helpful part of the app because it puts all of the headers under the microscope. This allows the user to have a deeper understanding of the HTTP protocol and way's to use it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app using electron and node.js. It was an easy choice because electron is a simple yet powerful framework and I could use my web development skills . I used the
                    <a href="http://shoelace.style" rel="nofollow">
                        shoelace
                    </a>
                    CSS framework and electron to help with the user interface. Everything else was done with the standard node libraries. Both electron and shoelace were frameworks that I was using for the first time so I got to learn a great deal in those areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot throughout this project. Unfortunately, much of this was from trial and error. I'm not used to working with HTTP requests at such a fundamental level so I had to learn how to use headers and how to best represent data I had never seen before. I had great difficulty with the iframe tag as well. I had to find odd javascript workarounds to manipulate them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the final product. I have worked very hard on it and I think that it payed off. I got to push my skills to create something interesting and that is a very satisfying feeling. The efforts I made helped me learn more about HTTP, electron, and hacking in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HTTP protocol is interesting to deal with. It took me a while to be able to work with headers and different sorts of data. I had to fail a lot to end up with a working system. Once I learned what to expect it became much easier to manipulate the data and grapple a big project like this. I also had to learn how to work with iframes which was very difficult. I also learned how to manage my time in order to finish the project on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MemePI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think I'm going to improve upon what I have know so I can explore more of the web development world. And there is no doubt that the things I've learned during this hackathon will be used for many projects going forward. Both on a software level and personal level.
