                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After meeting on the bus before we even arrived at Cornell, ideas were flying around until we decided that we wanted to pursue using an API. Capital One's new Hackathon API "Nessie" seemed like it was the most flexible of the API's to explore because we were able to use existing simulated data and even submit our own.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "What the Hack" is a tool that provides a data visualization platform to the Capital One bank and it's customers. Customers are able to get a more insightful view of their expenditures, deposits, and withdrawals by using a map rather than looking at a table. Banks are able to visualize traffic associated with the bank branches through the volatility associated with its customers' deposits and withdrawals. This allows banks to have a clear understanding of the current liquidity holding of their branches which enables them better judgement in future business ventures.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Bootstrap to duct tape a front end together and Python to write the backend, the app was constructed.
This was contrary to our original design of using NodeJS for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally decided that we wanted to use NodeJS as a backend. However, as we kept running into trouble with CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) for no apparent reason, we decided that what was taking us hours to accomplish in NodeJS could easily be written in one in Flask, the Python microframework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Shifted our backend from NodeJS to Flask even though the Hackathon was half over. Delved into the basics of NodeJS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NodeJS is hard, Flask is easy. We learned how to use and interact with an API on different platforms and observing the benefits and detriments of each one. We were able to look into the business side of an idea rather than just scratching the surface, and determine when to use a particular technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What the Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating larger data sets, more features for users to look at, like their deposits, withdrawals, ATM Information, and more visualization tools are just some of the tools that customers have to look forward to. Capital One can look forward to having more precise additions in terms of expansions based on current customer activities.
