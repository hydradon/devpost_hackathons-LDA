                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the limited time, we thought it would be fun to develop a little game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a interesting party game. Basically it's given a keyword, one person draw and others guess what the keyword is based on his/her drawing. The most fun part of the game is the drawings of the players. Due to limited time and drawing space, most of the time the drawing can be quite funny as well as illustrative
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Swift and Socket.io, a websocket library for iOS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs, it's really hard to finish the bug-free game in one night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished it in the end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket.io and websocket, which can be used for real time communication. In our game it is the drawing will show on every player's phone simultaneously
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fingertip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to add more functionality to the game to make it more complete, and then published.
