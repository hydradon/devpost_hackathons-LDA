                    GreenTravel is a web-app for users who take public transit, bike or walk to participate challenges, get rewards and make an impact on the environment. 
The app will integrate with public transpiration system or fitness tracking app e.g. TranLink to get users&rsquo; travel hours. When users add their compass card on the app, they will earn points based on the travel time. They can redeem these points to get discounts or a product. At the same time, users can invite their friends to participate in difference challenges for fun. Everyone can see their points and rankings in the community to stay motivate and get more rewards.  The ranking is based on the points. Higher the points a user has, higher ranking he/she will get. Lastly, they can see the percentage of less carbon footprint they produce in their daily lives.  Register an account to play, reward and make an impact on your daily travel.

                    The problem: to reduce greenhouse gas emission on transportation.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    According to Unite State Environment Protection Agency study, a vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Therefore, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emission on the transportation and public transportation is the most effective way to reduce carbon footprint on the environment.

                <p>
                    In this Girl in Tech Vancouver Hacking for Humanity hackathon, we built a sustainable app called GreenTravel to encourage more people to take public transportation, ride a bike or walk. GreenTravel is a web-app for users who take public transit, bike or walk to participate challenges, get rewards and make an impact on the environment.

                    The project is written in JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. Proper implementation of this projects involves the usage framework Node.Js and APIs from Compass card, Strava, and mobi Bikes.

                    Which part was the most difficult to implement and why?

                <p>
                    The challenge of this project was about ideas validation, the technology implication and UX/UI design to make our app user-friendly. This is because some technology implement is a bit complicated and we don&rsquo;t have enough time to execute all the ideas. We have to simple our ideas and focus on a few key features. Eventually, we overcome these challenges
                </p>

                <p>
                    After this hackathon, we will continue to polish our app by adding more features, including challenges page. Also, we will develop more partnership with sustainable friendly companies to join rewarding program. At the same time, we will promote our app on social media to get more users.
