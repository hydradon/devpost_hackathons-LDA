                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Rookery Radio app was inspired from not having an android app aside from Tunein Radio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app streams music from an Icecast2 server, and also streams the Meta Data from the server as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bulk of our core code came fron the Hive365 Android app Source code on Github, from there we took out functions that were irrelevant for what Rookery Radio needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into was getting the app to read the Meta Data from our server. And properly display it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud that I was finally able to get the Meta Data working, since it was the problem we had to deal with since the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of this project, I now have a deeper insight into Java, JSONObjects, XML, and Working with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rookery Radio Android App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to publish this app on The Play Store for any to use and Listen to Rookery Radio on their android device as they please, while I keep up on minor bug updates.
