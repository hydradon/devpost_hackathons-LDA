                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to become better at graphical programming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slices meshes during runtime in unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making different strategies on how to slice it using the vertices of the mesh to slice and the vertices of the mesh that does the slicing. 
And after the strategizing was done, I started programming it in unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to change strategies a few times, and had to look up a lot of linear algebra to use with code.
Also, this was my first time doing vertex editing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that a year ago, trying to do a mechanic like this, in 24 hours no less, would have seemed way out of my league.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about graphical programming, and using linear algebra in algorithms.

                <p>
                    Trying to make it work with 3D shapes like cubes and spheres.
