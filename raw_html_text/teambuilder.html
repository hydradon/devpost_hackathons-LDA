                    When we arrive this Friday at our first Hackathon, HackUPC Winter 2017, we were two couples of hackers and wanted to make a team to be four, so we joined forces in order to gain as much as possible of this wonderful experience.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teambuilder is an app/program that helps hackers find their most adequat partners in order to start the project as soon as possible and have fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python in order to create the algorithm and at the same time we tried to build the app on android-studio. Afterwards, we tired to join the app to the algorithm with a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first hackathon for all of us, so we had to work on hardly with the algorithm and ran into many problems due to our lack of experience in the field. We also had many difficulties with setting up a data base and an app because non of us knew how to build them and we had to start from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving our skills on python and android-studio. Going from scratch to the final project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Python, android-studio and database

                <p>
                    Improving the algorithm, finishing the app and connected to a database.
