                    We're a team of three coding beginners (as our self-deprecating name indicates).  Zoie and Kelsey were on a debate team in high school, and they found that their opponent would often not present their evidence, at least not in a way that was clear.  At first, we set out to build a tool that would both present evidence and judge its source's bias and reliability, using some windowing system as well, but as we were starting, we judged that we didn't have the experience or time necessary to make our project in full.  Instead, we worked on a prototype that acts as a PDF generator, at least displaying that our product could act as a standardized tool.
