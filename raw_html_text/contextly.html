                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a tool that would help people learn the ins and outs of the English language, more specifically, all the different ways one word can be used!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Chrome extension that allows you to highlight and right click any word to view its many different use cases along with similar use cases to further your understanding of the English language!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google's Chrome extension tools, APIs, and libraries, the Flask micro-framework for Python web applications, and nltk, a natural language processing library for Python that allowed us to analyze sentences for their differing contexts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome extensions are so weird. Everything's locked in its own "sandbox" almost and you have to pass around all these "messages" to get the different parts communicating with each other. It was so hard to get the current page to talk to the extension, especially with regards to grabbing the sentence that the highlighted word is in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was so tough to get the sentence that contained the word you would highlight due to the inherent blocking nature of Chrome extension communications. But we powered through it! After five hours, we did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots!
                </p>

                    Everything!
