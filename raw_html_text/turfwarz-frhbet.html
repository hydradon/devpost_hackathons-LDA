                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to spice up an ordinary jog where the only goal was for your own physical benefit into a competitive game where you can earn territory for your jog.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilize the microsoft-band and android mobile device to track your route and verify if you are indeed jogging. After returning to your starting point, it will submit to the server the area you captured. You are able to capture your enemy's turf and unconquered turf. You forfeit your current route if you stop for 30s, so we make sure you are earning your turf.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the microsoft-band to track if your heartbeat is high enough to be considered good activity and if you are jogging. This is utilized by the mobile app to determine whether it should continue polling and forfeit the route. The android app displays a simple map view that updates as you run your route so you can see how much territory you can capture on your current route. After returning to the starting point, you complete your route and the turf amount is submitted to the server and stored.
                </p>
