                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have an obsession with cats and I love to search lol cats. I thought I should make a game based around this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You move around, trying to dodge the opposing cat, who will swipe at you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote my code in a rush, leading to redundancies in code which slow down additions/changes to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a semi-working AI system, getting the grid system to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spend time making things scalable first, coding the bulk of it later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CatFight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better AI that is less prone to moving into you, better collision detection.
