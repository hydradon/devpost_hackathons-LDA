                    Our project takes on the task of the parking garage situation at UMSL. We decided to track the in and out traffic of individual garages in order to display to the students the capacity at any given time. We plan on implementing our app into the pre-exising UMSL app while also redesigning its layout. With our stored traffic data we will be able to determine hot and cold spots in terms of certain parking garages. This way we can encourage students to park in lesser used garages by giving rewards based on a point system for checking into them by sliding their ID as they enter and exit the garage.
