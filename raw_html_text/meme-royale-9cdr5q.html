                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that there are no popular meme games out there was very heartbreaking for us meme-lovers. Hence, that acted as an inspiration for this project to serve all the meme lords out there!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a trivia game where it allows you to either create a new room or join an existing one. The creator of the room gets to choose the theme of the meme for the first round and then everyone else in the room gets a few choices of meme templates. After a template is chosen by the player, the player gets to put a caption on the meme. Next, all the memes except their own are displayed on a voting screen. The meme with the highest vote wins the round! The player with the highest vote points at the end of all rounds wins the game!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native for the front end and socket io and MongoDB for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working on the project, we realized that react-native is not really friendly to humans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an android and IOS app in less than 24 hours!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that writing every line in javascript teaches you something new every time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meme Royale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan is to share this app in our social media and get all of the Memelords hooked to something they all have looking for!
