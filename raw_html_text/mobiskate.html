                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you have a phone (or other accelerometer enabled web-device), and another machine, you can use your phone as a tilt-sensitive controller to control a skateboard on the other screen for a great deal of fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket.io (managed by a node.js server) allows your phone (or other accelerometer enabled web-device) to act as a controller and communicate with another computer which acts as the display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We probably should have brushed up on our Linear Algebra before this hackathon!  Also, we are both new to socket.io and enjoyed learning the new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As always, shipping a hack we can be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great chance to experiment and learn many new things!  Neither of us had used socket.io or the html5 accelerometer API before this hackathon.
                </p>

                    What's next for MobiSkate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, while we are happy with what we are able to create in our limited time, this project could obviously use a great deal more polish.
