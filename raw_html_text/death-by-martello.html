                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love a great problem solving challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The murder mystery solver tool provides a visual method to trace individual people through a two level floor plan and displays each persons last know location based on a time bar that can be adjusted by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two team members worked on understanding the given data set to then develop an algorithm to categorize, organize and store all of the locations for each of the individual guests. The third team member worked on developing the UI such that there was a scrubber to travel between the timestamps of movement and display each person in the correct location on the map
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to interpret the given data logically before implementing an algorithm to determine the locations of each of the people within the challenge. Creating an interactive UI in order to display the algorithms finding in a nice and visual way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piecing together the algorithm with the front end UI, after working on both parts separately. We persevered through many bugs in a time sensitive environment to complete mystery solver tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned of to effectively split up workload in a team based environment, in order to complete a task within a hard deadline.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hacked2Death
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the efficiency of the scrubber to not allow empty moments.
