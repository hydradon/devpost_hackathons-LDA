                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a year's worth of data from payroll and billing and put it into excel. From all this data, we were able to see find what our cost and revenue drivers are. With this, we could work on reducing costs that weren't necessary, and charge groups what they should be charged instead of a flat rate.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was figuring out what the new base price should be in order to cover all operating costs while still keeping the price of shows down.
