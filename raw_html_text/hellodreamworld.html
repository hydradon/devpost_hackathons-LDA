                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a fun math game for kids!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program guides the player through a text-based maze full of spooky encounters with iconic Halloween characters. In order to win, the player must beat the monsters by correctly solving custom elementary level arithmetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                    We coded the entire program on Eclipse using Java.
