                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This webapp is made by three MIT girls, who often find themselves struggling with homework. We thought it'd be great to have a platform that connects people with similar academic interests. Psetting is MIT colloquial for doing homework, and as we explain to people who are interested, this webapp is like
                    <strong>
                        "Tinder" for psetting
                    </strong>
                    !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp asks for basic information regarding user's coursework and study habits, and runs a machine learning algorithm to help the user find his/her best match as pset buddies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our webpage using html. Server is in Flask, and our machine learning algorithm is implemented in python using the Numpy and Pandas libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our team has ever had web development experience, so we had to learn all basic details (i.e. everything except Python) from scratch. Solving real life problems can be more confounding than textbook examples. In our case, we had to deal with incomplete information, human input variations, and processing big bulks of data within reasonable time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we started with no experience and no project in mind and finished off with a functional web app in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    html, Flask, components of a web app (e.g. server), database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PSetBuddies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that our app will be widely used within MIT communities and beyond. We will also make our project into a real web app by hosting it online and transforming it into a mobile app.
