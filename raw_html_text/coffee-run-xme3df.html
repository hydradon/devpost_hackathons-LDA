                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have two main needs: Coffee and money. As a student we often run to class wishing we could have made the coffee trip or wish we can make the run without wasting studying time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app connects students on the same campus wiling to pick up a drink on their way with students in need of a caffeine boost. We incentivize with loyalty credits and seamlessly connect students to both their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built mobile first. Combining our teams strengths together to build a fully functioning web app in react.js, node.js, express.js, squelizer, and postgress along with twillio and google maps APIs for a fully end-to-end experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammate got sick! It really really sucked to have 25% of our team completely unable to participate. Furthernmore, you can imagine how worried we were as friends. We took time to check in with her, make sure she was cared for and got on her way home earlier. This team also consisted of two beginner hackers and 3 javascript newbies. It was incredibly challenging to learn so much material in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Josh understood what we did. We have a fully end-to-end experience on a smooth mobile first experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a team even when our teammate fell ill. We stuck together and accomplished our goals nonetheless. Most of all, we grew as developers and friends. It was a lot of fun and even more challenges.
                </p>

                    What's next for Coffee.Run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to fill the data with actual menus and to partner with companies.
