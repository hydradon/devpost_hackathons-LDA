                    is a VR acting and performing experience where participants can either choose a script from a popular film or play or load their own material.

A virtual actor will run lines with you, or grab friends to act out a scene. There's also Merge Cube integration to incorporate virtual tactile props. Users can grab a skull when reciting Hamlet's soliloquy or a sword when acting out the scene from
