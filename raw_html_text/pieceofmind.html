                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the rise in prevalence of concussions and other minor traumatic brain injuries, and we  wanted to look at a convenient and low-cost method of monitoring patient status. In some cases, "sub-concussions" cannot even be detected at an initial physician exam, so the best way to track and prevent serious or fatal brain injury would be to look at the overall trend of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piece of Mind is a personal, portable, and prevention-based concussion test that is independently stored within a wireless Arduino Uno. Users will traverse through pre-loaded SCAT tests to monitor patient status, and can use a Matlab script to compare data trends over time. This will help track healing or the possibility of "sub-concussions" which may not be detected with a one-time physician exam, and allow more at-home monitoring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mounted a Grove Base Shield onto an Arduino Uno that has an interactive RGB LCD display and accelerometer connected, which will allow users to interact directly with the SCAT test as well as detect a patient's balance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Arduino does not have enough global memory storage, so while our entire test is uploaded, we had to comment out portions of each subtest to ensure a quality and stable demonstration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a Matlab script that can analyze trends over time, and eventually we hope to be able to take input of multiple User IDs to monitor and track the data of multiple users. We also would like to expand the memory storage of our Arduino to ensure a full-length SCAT exam.
