                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was that people need something that they can use to track every aspect of their health so that they can get the best out of life.

                <p>
                    The Health Stat Tracker (HST), records and updates your personal health information to inform you when
you need to take/refill medications, go to the gym, or even inform you of an illness you could have caught.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammate, Hunter Willingham, and I brainstormed on what it holds. Then used a Java switch to make the GUI so
that it could display the information needed. After that we just implemented a few text methods so that the user could
input their personal data into the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was trying to figure out how to let the user input their own data into the GUI, and having it display the information in the correct order and place.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that my teammate and I finished our program with a lot of time left to go back and refine it. It took us about 24 hours to build, and we did it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that no matter how impossible a task may seem, there is always a way to beat it. And no matter how frustrated you can get, never give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Stat Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hunter Willingham and I are going to implement a GPS system into the system, build a database to store and load all the data, and also build a chart/graph so that the user can see their progress grow each day.
