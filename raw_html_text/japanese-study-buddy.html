                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started learning Japanese this semester and wanted an app/website that I could use to practice what I learn in the textbook.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now there is a page for the Kana characters and you can hover over each character and it changes it to English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Learning how to code with another language involved. Formatting differences between languages.

                    I like the hover feature that I made that switches Japanese text with English text.
