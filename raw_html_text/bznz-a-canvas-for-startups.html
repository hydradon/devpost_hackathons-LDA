                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people believe that startups just come about as sudden, brilliant ideas that occur in the shower. However, this is risky - we are often wrong about what we believe and don't know until we test our startup in the real world. A startup can therefore instead be thought of as a
                    <em>
                        testing of hypotheses
                    </em>
                    , where we aim to find a business model that works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to do this is to use a
                    <em>
                        business model canvas
                    </em>
                    , which has traditionally been done using sticky notes and paper. However, this doesn't allow us to really track our progress properly, and we can't analyse the progress we've made. BznzCanvas gives a beautiful solution to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BznzCanvas allows you to see all the details of your startup's business model at a glance. You can add your hypotheses and test them out in the real world! As your hypotheses change, you can replace them with what you discover about your startup, and a history of all the data is kept for your analysis.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS/ExpressJS and MongoDB for the back-end, and VueJS for the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming an idea that fit our skills was tough, despite our team having both a back-end and front-end developer and a medical student. We initially started working on holograms for doctors, but had to pivot at 6pm on the first day because it proved to be too steep a learning curve for us as we had very little experience in Unity3D. Pivoting and playing to the developer's strengths early proved to be a smart move, however.

                        Attempting to program in a completely new language/engine for the first time is a risky endeavour (Unity3D)

                    <li>
                        Preparing a team before the hackathon would have made things easier

                    What's next for BZNZ - A Canvas For Startups
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BZNZ's killer function would be its ability to track events in a startup's lifecycle, as well as the metrics that correlate with them. Once we get more user data about patterns of business usage, we can start to provide recommendations to startups about useful variations on hypotheses and things they can do to make their startup better faster.
