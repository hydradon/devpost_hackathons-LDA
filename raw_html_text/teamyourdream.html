                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has an unique, wild dream that they haven't got the motivation to complete! It has been proved that committing your dream with a partner can increase the chance of success by 85%! Taking in account the fact that humans can make progress intensively 
and effectively based on co-operation and teamwork, we want to help connect people with the a dream partner so that the pair can both make their dreams come true!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application that allows each people to have an account. Users have to log in and complete their application and their profile. Then they fill in their goals and dreams and the priorities of the dreams. They also need to specify the date that they should finish. Our application will match them to a partner based on the dreams keyword, dream priority, location and date finishing. The partners can view profile and chat to each other, starting the process. After you and your partner have finished a goal, you both will receive a medal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For front-end, we use HTML CSS javascript, material design and for back-end we use Python &amp; SQLite3 - relational database management system.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tiredness and lack of time.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea in only 5 minutes! We are all first-year students and we could fortunately finished the project!
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We doesn't only create a really cool app that is pretty unique and useful but we only learn a lot from the hackathon: teamwork, communication, project management, design, function and even..new languages!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to add a login feature connected to social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Google+ so that anyone around the world can use our website.  After creating this project successfully, we are looking forward to collaborate again to create new ideas and make more unique products!
