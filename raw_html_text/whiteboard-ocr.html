                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Etiquia company needed some way to save their whiteboards on their electronic devices. This is why they offered the challenge to make one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You send a picture from the web, either from URL or your PC, and the application generates an page, formatted the same way as your whiteboard : Font size, and text position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to build the web interface, react-native for the mobile one, and Firebase for the database and storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties with sending binaries to the Microsoft vision API on the web, so we have finally choose to host ourselves the pictures on firebase. We also struggled with the file system on react-native as it does not natively support it, and various packages conflicts that took way too much time to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the chance to learn the Microsoft OCR API, how to avoid some react-native caveats during setup, and blob/files/buffers in javascript. This was also the chance to strenghten our React skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Whiteboard OCR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first draft of the mobile app is almost complete to take photo, upload them on firebase and then generate the JSON for the front-end to display.
We also thought of a github integration : automatically fill your project columns with cards if you respect a specific format on the whiteboard.
