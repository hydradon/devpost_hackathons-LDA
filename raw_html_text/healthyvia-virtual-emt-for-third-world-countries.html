                <p>
                    My friend who is a doctor works at a mid-scale hospital in my hometown says every day more than 50 to 80 people get admitted to their hospital due to emergency conditions like heart-stroke, accidents, internal trauma etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The people who live in rural areas and who don't have better access to emergency services like ambulance always bring the victims to the hospital without providing/following emergency medical protocols, due to which the survival rate of the victims getting admitted to their hospital is very less or makes it harder for the doctors to provide proper treatment.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        For example,
                    </strong>
                    one of the common emergency protocol during heart-stroke is to treat the victim immediately with Aspirin 300mg tablet which increases the after treatment survival rate by 90%. A victim had suffered from heart-stroke and their colleagues who were not aware of this protocol were waiting for the ambulance and did not implement the above-mentioned protocol. By the time the ambulance had arrived, it was already too late for the EMT to treat this victim and lost him.
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    Survival rates in India during medical emergencies are very less. We want to educate people of India about the significance of Emergency Medical Services and also assist them during medical emergencies.
