                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing the ESL challenge from the Agathon pitches, we were determined to creating an app that is simple to use, allows farmers to go at their own pace, and can utilize existing resources that the Dept of Agriculture has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to make an Android app that allows users to learn about good farming practices, test themselves, have a glossary of terms, view frequently asked questions, and contact an expert if they have any questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current functionality includes a language selection list, glossary of fake terms, and courses with a lesson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio 3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two members of the team have not done much Android development and we had to learn new concepts on the fly while implementing the app. Also functionality that we thought could be easily done with the tools provided in Android Studio turned out to be more difficult than anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, dedication, and delight from the subject matter expert over our prototype mockup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android development can be tricky.
                </p>

                    What's next for Farm Safe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build out more functionality, clean up the app design, support more devices.
