                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the upcoming Star Wars movie, we chose to make a game based off of the millennium falcon and the most common and widely recognized spaceships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a video game that allows the player to move around the screen and collect powerups in order to defeat the most enemies and bosses and achieve the highest score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the software portion of the project with Python 3 in conjunction with the Pygame library, in addition to Arduino UNOs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to setup the ultrasonic sensor by the specified project due date, due to the absence of our teammate who mostly handled hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a full-fledged and polished game (software-wise) that even us, the creators, were able to enjoy playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of processing power restrictions and how limited some programming engines could be.

                    What's next for Space Blazerz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a website we had previously designed, we will try to utilize
                    <code>
                        pyjsdl
                    </code>
                    to embed the game onto a website.
