                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always work as a remote team, and always have to depend on mails from GitHub when an activity occurs. 
After a session of brainstorming, we realized that almost everyone with a smartphone has facebook messenger installed and ready to receive messages that's why we decided to build this tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application aims to leverage facebook messenger platform to by connecting it with  GitHub Platform so developers within a firm can get updates
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without the need to monitor the events from their email
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Application Would Message Them Of Relevant Activity on the Repositories they are maintaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend of the project was built using laravel, this is responsible for the communication between the GitHub server and the facebook messenger bot platform.
When there is an activity on the GitHub repo the laravel platform is trigged and then sends a message to the bot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some challenges with the cloud server, we used azure but had issues with the https communication, we had to resort back to using a domain name and digitalocean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to communicate with the server, the server speaks with both GitHub and messenger bot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learned how to use the GitHub API, how to talk to facebook messenger using the provided API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Git Messenger Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will add a function whereby we can send commit messages from the bot, accept merge request from the bot and view/edit the code from within the facebook messenger platform
                </p>
