                        The Old
                    </strong>
                    It all began with the feels. For centuries, humans have attempted to record the wide range of emotions they feel through literature and arts.

                    </strong>
                    With an average daily volume of over 500 million tweets, Twitter is an incredible treasure trove of data. But what to do with this data?
                </p>

                        Twitter Search API
                    </strong>
                    The Twitter Search API was used to search for and retrieve tweets that matched a keyword or hashtag. Then, the tweets were parsed and analyzed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Microsoft Azure
                    </strong>
                    Lexicon based sentiment analysis and natural language processing was done using Microsoft Azure to measure tweet sentiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Firebase REST API
                    </strong>
                    We used the Firebase database and web hosting service seamlessly integrate everything together, from the tweets to the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Google Maps API
                    </strong>
                    The MarkerClusterer library was used in conjunction with the Google Maps API to display tags to show tweet volume trends.

                    <strong>
                        D3.js
                    </strong>
                    This Javascript library was used to apply transformations on the data, creating the real-time line graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Google Charts

                    We used Google Charts to display customized bar graphs and pie charts.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this many APIs, a major challenge was figuring out how to integrate everything. We wanted to be able to add new tweets while accessing the old tweets, all in real-time, without running into any problems. To do this, we used a NoSQL database hosted by Firebase to simultaneously sync with everything, which saved us tons of headache. Firebase also provided a web hosting service that allowed us to access our finished product from any computer, instead of hosting it on a local server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, managing all the different languages was also a difficult task, as certain libraries did not play well with others. With everyone working on their own component, merging everything back together took some time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having used Microsoft Azure and natural language processing for the first time. In addition, none of us had used Twitter's API, so being able to learn something new was exciting :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different APIs,  how to access things from a database, and how to integrate everything together. We also learned how powerful machine learning and natural language processing can be.
                </p>

                    What's next for EmotiMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for EmotiMap involve expanding to other social media sites, adding new search terms, and adding other natural language languages and processes, such as key phrase extraction.
