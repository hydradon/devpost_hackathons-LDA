                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to do a project with computer vision this time around. We settled on creating a system that lets you use simple gestures to control most of the UI functionality on your computer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user wears two sleeves on their thumb and index finger, each a different color. We use these as trackers to see where the user's fingers are. They are then able to use gestures to move the mouse, click, scroll and switch between programs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV to capture images from the webcam and process the position of the user's fingers. We also used pyautogui which is a library that allows us to control different aspects of the OS's gui.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally tried this without any finger sleeves. That produced horrendously awful results and we messed around with that for a while.
