                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a dynamic team page for HackSheffield's website. Having to keep people's info updated is a pain, so putting it through GitHub profiles decentralises it and allows the information to stay up to date in a mutually convenient way. GitHub is an amazing Content Management System, especially using their incredibly useful GraphQL API, so the additional features that this brings to mygit.club streamline the process of showing your team to the world in a major way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls team data from a GitHub organisation and renders a team page with linked icons based on GitHub profile data and extra configuration via a GitHub repo in the organisation. This is convenient since it's always right up to date with what's on GitHub's servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Node.js server pulls data from GitHub via their GraphQL API on request, then renders the data to the view with Pug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we were using jQuery out of our existing familiarity with it. However, this created problems with looping through the team records for totally unknown reasons, so we decided to use Pug so we could more easily splice in the data.
