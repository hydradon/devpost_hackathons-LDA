                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a team member called Kakoo and Jumpei.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jumpei&rsquo;s hobby is riding a road bike. He had an experience that it is difficult to decide what to buy.
He searched it on the Internet, but online-articles always recommend any products. He could not know how much of it is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kakoo&rsquo;s hobby is airsoft(survival game). He loves to play it on the weekend with his co-workers.
He has even four his own guns,but he has a problem that there is no space to keep his precious guns in his house.

                <p>
                    OPEN GARAGE is one of the WMS( Warehouse Management System ).
Our service has two unique points.
Firstly, your garage is opened to the public. Everyone can see what you deposit in OPEN GARAGE.
Of course you can see others&rsquo; garages. So you can know the products is actually used by real users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, you can borrow others&rsquo; products.
If you want to use garage function, you can use cheaper than any other&rsquo;s WMS instead of opening your outfits to the public.
When you find favorite one, you can ask the owner to borrow.
If they accept your request, you can borrow it.
You can try it before you&rsquo;ve decided to buy or not.
In addition, the owner can earn money depends on his accept.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website by using html and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It is difficult to recognize which information is true on the Internet.
You need to find reliable one by yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can see what others actually are using.
Unlike SNS, you can also check information on people who do not send outside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it important that researching similar services
                </p>

                    What&rsquo;s next for Open Garage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future, we think two amazing things will happen.
One, we can replace rental shops like TSUTAYA. Because we make a platform to rental between individual users.
Two, we can make  a business alliance with other EC sites like amazon.
