                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to try one of Centene's persona challenges and I thought it was the perfect time to learn how to make an iOS app since I only worked with Android before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that allows people to connect with the elder folks in the community who are looking for company to do activities with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used XCode and the iOS language Swift to build the app and Firebase as the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never built an iOS app before, so picking up Swift and the XCode IDE was a bit difficult at first, but it was not as different from developing an Android app than I originally thought. I also had challenges connecting Firebase to my app, but it worked out eventually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I was able to create parts of the app, even though it still needs a lot of work, but it's a good start!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Swift and how Storyboards work in XCode. I learned a bit of UI design as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eldy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would hope to implement many features for Eldy including a complete user profile, an in-app messaging system, and a way to connect people who are interested in the same activities so that they can make plans together.
