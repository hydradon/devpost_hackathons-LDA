                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make an app that promotes safety at a hackathon and that takes an active stand against harassment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, it uses the chatbot in order to get the user's profile and story and emails the information to the MLH incident email address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the microsoft bot API to communicate with the user and then email the report to the incidents email for Major league hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a LOT of trouble getting the program to run. Visual Studio and the bot emulator are not running the program on my computer but we have a vision!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time at a hackathon and actually coding an app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the chatbot and cognitive services API. I also learned that coding an app is very similar to coding any project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Halt Hack Harassment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding it's use so that Major League hacking can implement this in the future and parsing the major league hacking website to email the incident report to the hackathon emails.
