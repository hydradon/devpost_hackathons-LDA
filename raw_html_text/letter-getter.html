                    We wanted to build something that learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Letter Getter compares what was drawn to what it has seen in the past
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It compares certain points, and sees how similar they are to the data we have
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    If the size of the characters were drastically different, it would not find the correct character, also it could only do a single character at a time
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It works a decent amount of the time

                    If we come back to this we would fix the size and single character issues
