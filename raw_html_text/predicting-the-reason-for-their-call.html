                    Unclean data
Very unclean data
A lot of data
Less Compute Power. Google Colab wasn't a very great experience tbh.

                    What I learned

                    A lot about the AI space in Montreal,  some of the exciting works some of the startups are doing and, in general, brushed up my ML which I hadn't touched in a while.

                    What's next for Predicting the reason for their call
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Using calls data with crime data (use a reverse_geocoder to get the Arrondisments)
2) Using calls data with income data
A lot of interesting things can be done with these 3.
