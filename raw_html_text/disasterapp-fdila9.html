                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a safer, more efficient way for relief organizations to learn the needs of natural disaster victims in order to help. To access areas struck by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, relief organizations often have to send members to the area, which can be perilous and time-consuming. Disasterapp provides a solution to this problem.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disasterapp is a mobile app in which natural disaster victims can input their needed supplies. This data is sent to relief organizations, which will then provide the needed supplies.

                    Android Studio took several hours to download.

                    Neither of us had used Android Studio before the Technica 2017 Hackathon. We learned a lot about how to use and apply Android Studio to develop apps.

                    We learned how to operate Android Studio to develop Disasterapp.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    WiFi and connection is often poor or nonexistent after natural disasters. In the future, drones could fly over disaster areas and provide WiFi to improve app connection. Satellites could also be used to provide a connection for the app. Drones could be used to bring the supplies to the disaster area. The phone being used to access the app could also take the location of the device to provide a specific location to the drone for supply drop-off.
