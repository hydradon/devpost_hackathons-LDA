                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many New Yorkers in this day and age, citizens are always in a rush to get to their destination. Some drivers are reckless on the road and this affects everyone around them. To prevent motor collisions from happening, our web app helps drivers to be more cautious, especially in areas that are known to have many accidents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VISION [0] uses IBM Text to Speech in order to warn drivers to drive with caution in areas that have the most motor collisions occurring in NYC. The collisions are mapped from the NYPD's Motor Vehicle Collisions report, found on NYC Open Data. Often times in dangerous intersection areas some people think that it is alright to drive fast. In reality, driving slowly and with caution is the best source of action to drive safely. This app increases awareness of the frequency of accidents on busy streets.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is built with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and the Google Maps and Markers APIs. The back end is MongoDB and Python with Pymongo, and Flask connects the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us were unfamiliar with web development and using Flask. Getting the Google API to get marker clusters were difficult at first but after much testing and discussion with mentors we got it to work. We had to switch from Node.js to Flask to better integrate our back and front ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud that in the last minute we were still able to keep working on our project despite the challenges we faced throughout the Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better integrate front and back end services to create a webpage. We also learned how to integrate multiple APIs in order to return a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vision [0]
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make it a mobile app so that users can see the areas with motor vehicle collision through google maps on their phone.
