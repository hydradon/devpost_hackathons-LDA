                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space is a fascinating place, which is why a website about its peculiarities needed to come into existence. We wanted to provide people with information about space weather, the planets, and visible constellations to better educate people about the wonders outside our atmosphere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site provides unique information about space including solar winds and radiation levels, the aurora borealis, the phase of the moon, and more. We have included a page for users to examine the different constellations visible in their area of the world. Users can also learn about the planets through an interactive map of the solar system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Json to create the database in our front page. Javascript and Jquery were used to develop the dynamics of the site, as well as alter its appearence, which was created with html, css, and Bootstrap.
                </p>
