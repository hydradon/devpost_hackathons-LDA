                    What is the Market Like?
The millennial population (aged 18-34) is expected to be the largest population group by 2016, and the largest group of restaurant patrons. According to a 2014 Mintel Research Report, Millennial&rsquo;s ate out the most in 2014; they form the bread and butter clientele that most restaurants depend on for current and future sales. 57% of millennial men and 50% of millennial women are more likely to visit restaurants that offer new technology that makes the dining process more convenient.
