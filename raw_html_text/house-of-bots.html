                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a plethora of candidates running in 2016. We were wondering how predictable the current state of media politics can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So by combining leading candidate data from Twitter and a clever sprinkling of algorithm magic we have been able to simulate how candidates today use social media to direct their strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Markov Chains and a twitter scraping tool we were able to extract and analyze a large data-set of tweets which are then fed to a live-stream front-end that simulates the current political climate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of the group was inexperienced with working with web tools. In addition we had a different implementation in mind but the API we were using was too young into production and thus was not capable of servicing our business object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the late pivot we were able to quickly distill what is the core function behind the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Markov Chains are cool - like lifesaving awesome content cool. IBM Bluemix was awesome (we hope to use it in the near near future)
                </p>
