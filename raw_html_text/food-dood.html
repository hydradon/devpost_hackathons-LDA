                    We were able to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implement a program in python that
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        takes in a photo from the user of their food item
locates that food item in a database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        returns the nutritional and environmental info 
to the user.
## What we used
Programming done in Python 3.6.0.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Used the Google Cloud Vision API for image recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Used Nutritionix API for nutritional data access

                    Develop the program ideally into a mobile app, because this would provide the most convenience to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allow the user to take the photo within the application.
