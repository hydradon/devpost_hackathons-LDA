                    We came up with the idea of SeatCheck while standing in line at the restaurant, waiting to get seated. We saw that most tables were only 50% occupied, so we though that there has to be a way to join people who are already sitting there and fill up those empty seats. 
Waiting in line at the restaurant is a problem which did not have a solution out there so we created one ourselves.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SeatCheck connects people who are already sitting in the restaurant, who have empty seats on their tables, with people in the area who are looking to grab a seat without the wait.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was not a developer, so I taught myself to code first. Took some help from some friends and other people along the way but I finally got it together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to code. Once I was done with that, I had to get the word out for the app. It&rsquo;s been challenging but slowly I&rsquo;m getting over the hurdles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m proud to bring a product that was missing. It&rsquo;s something that people use and also they can relate to it instantaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many things but most importantly if you have a will there&rsquo;s a way.

                    What's next for SeatCheck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the android version out in the next few weeks and go all out with the marketing.
