                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the elderly population continues to grow, we wanted to create an app that centers on physical well-being which in turn promotes mental health. Staying active is essential for maintaining strength, mobility, independence, and general wellness. We sought to tackle key issues such lack of motivation, frustration, and fear of injury through a simple and clearly-designed app. From a large-scale perspective, our idea could vastly reduce medical care costs in a simple way. From a more personal view, our mission was to carve out a facet of technology that could be accessible and beneficial to the most important people in our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retrained allows elderly people to stay active and log their progress along the way. The app provides a personalized exercise/stretch for specific areas of pain or discomfort. Users can target a certain area of their body and then customize a desired exercise based upon intensity and location. Retrained will then provide multiple suggested exercises with descriptions and time lengths to choose from. Upon completing a program, the app will log the exercise completed as well as the user's mood afterwards. Retrained can then be used to consistently track pain areas, and measure progress and mood. The journal can be viewed at any time under a "Progress" tab for family members and medical professionals to get a more complete perspective on the user's condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off as a group of three without an experienced programmer so we had to come up with an idea and then revise how it could actually be put together as we went along. We had a lot of ideas and plans in terms of UI/UX but our challenge was communicating the ideas completely and figuring out the programming to make something responsive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad that we completed parts of a project with a purpose for social good. For most of our group this was our first hackathon, and we are happy that we submitted something for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how much work it takes to create an app and how interdisciplinary it is. The process requires a lot of different perspectives and skills to pull together into a complete project. We learned to utilize our own skills while incorporating new methods all of the time.
