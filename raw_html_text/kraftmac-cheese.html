                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We group of exceptional engineering students wanted to make Kraft Dinner (the typical college student dinner). However being engineers, these students refused to make the macaroni and cheese themselves, citing that it was nothing more than a trivial process. 12 hours of machining, programming, and a ton of macaroni and cheese later, the team of students designed an automated Kraft Dinner maker.

                    Carefully! Seriously, it might actually hurt you if you're not careful with this delicate beast.
