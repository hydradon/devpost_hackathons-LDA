                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Positivity. Love. Inclusion. Studies show over and over that having these things help patients heal faster and reintegrate better after trauma. Positivity is one of the easiest areas to target, but there is no tool for professionals to use to give it a number, not a subjective number, but an assigned number based on hard data.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    minipsych pulls data from email communications and analyzes it so that a psychiatrist or medical professional can get a reading on how positive their patients are.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using various API's and IBM Watson's sentiment analysis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this at 10 pm Saturday and worked almost entirely remotely on minimal sleep. One of us learned to code in python at calhacks. That was the person on the ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than a show of human resilience in the face of a good cause, this project seeks to meet a need that not many address, yet every patient I've spoken to has brought up. Regular communication is difficult and this helps you get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is work. A lot of work and code doesn't always work the first time or at all, especially if it's your first time with a language other than Matlab. It's also worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for minipsych
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With an interface and better security, minipsych can help psychiatrists, therapists, doctors, and concerned family members by creating a portal that utilizes the cutting edge of science to keep us honest with ourselves and take responsibility for our part in our loved one's road to recovery.
