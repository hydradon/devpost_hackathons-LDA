                <p>
                    We are surrounded by unstructured data. Every 2 days we create as much information as we did up to 2003. We need information at the right place and time. One way of accomplishing that is to group messages by physical location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Our solution is an app for geolocation based messaging.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adventure component is a nice addition inspired by the Harry Potter movies.

                    While working on the app, we considered the idea of mixing hidden messages with ads as means of monetisation. We also considered adding different types of content like Video Chats and Gifts.
