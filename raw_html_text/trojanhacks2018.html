                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been bored in class? Ever wanted to look at memes instead of listening to the lecture? If only there were a bingo game to play! 
Given our limited background, we chose to pursue this project because it strikes the balance as an idea that is feasible, as well as entertaining, and we decided to make a website in order to best display the visual elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The home page allows for login and holding of username, which will stay with you through the website even if you reload the page. The pictures are links to each of the boards. The student page relates to different aspects of general campus life. Each bingo board is 24 elements randomly sorted from an array of 35, allowing for different boards every time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Gameplay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clicking on an icon marks it with an x. Did you make an error? Simply tap again, and that x will disappear.
                    <br>
                    Does this board not interest you?  Click on the USC Bingo Icon and it will send you to the home page.
                    <br>
                    The game will automatically check to see if you win. A common bug that we fixed was when one square made the player win in multiple ways. When you win, the winning text will pop up, allowing for play again functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build a web app, we needed to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, yet most of us had no prior experience in these languages. Going to the web development workshop offered at TrojanHacks provided a solid foundation for our knowledge, and we are proud of learning these languages in order to produce USC Bingo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will explore a basic 2 player setting so that at least two players can interact with each other and be notified if the other wins. We also want to implement geofencing in the project so that certain bingo boards will be automatically shown depending on your location. For example, if a player is near the football stadium, then the Game Day board will be suggested. We will also add a build-your-own function to the bingo sheets, such that a user can add as many squares of their own as they want.
