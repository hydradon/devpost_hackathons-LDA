                    Every time we turn on the news, we hear stories of gun violence. It makes us think, is our city really safe? And what can we do to make to it safer? Smart city initiatives across the globe.. Rogers can play a part by leveraging its already existing IOT infrastructure. 
We propose an IOT based crime detection solution. At a high level, the solution consists of acoustic sensors that a trained to detect gunshots and violent altercations before assault through machine learning. These sensors could be installed on streetlights, schools, households and or any high crime zone across the country. When the sensors pick up such signals, it directs connected cameras to click pictures, focusing in the direction of the noise. The system will have the capability to detect false alarms based on machine learning trainings. Once the system has determined a positive, it will automatically trigger a 911 call.
