                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has had a questionable, financially irresponsible roommate. Shareabull prevents rent mishaps by distributing responsibility for rent to all tenants and creates a seamless way to pay month to month.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sharebull divides the rent for a living space to all tenants living there, makes paying for rent easier, and reminds users month to month.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS with Bootstrap and integrated the Paypal API for payment (for now).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty settling on a project and did not leave ourselves enough time to create a finished project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to create with Bootstrap for the first time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is key.
                </p>
