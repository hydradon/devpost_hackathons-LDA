                    Our team built Recyclora to encourage recycling habits in a fun way. This game spawns different objects and users have to quickly decide whether to recycle, compost, or throw them away to wrack up points!

                    This was built on Unity. Neither of us had used Unity or C# before, so learning to use the tools required a steep learning curve. Physics was a challenge, as was understanding the terminology used for game states in Unity.

                    We are proud of our art and effort in learning these technologies, and believe that this demo gives insight into how technology and games can incorporate environmentally sustainable practices into our lives to protect the earth.
