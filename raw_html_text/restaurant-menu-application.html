                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized many restaurants need an efficient solution for ordering and getting food info across efficiently, in bulk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In-app ordering system that provides data to waiters and chefs in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of Android Studio and Java, with cloud information from FireBase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the query manipulations, causing loss of some time. They are unlike most other iterated data structures, and as such were alien to most of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented real-time cloud storage of large amounts of data, with unique user IDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java data structures are quite unique, and more care must be taken with dealing with them than normal. Also, cloud storage is inordinately powerful, and is often an easier solution than long-term local storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Restaurant Menu Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing development of the Waiter/Chef app, which is close to complete. Further streamlining the UI and making implementation easier comes after that. Also, it may be reimplemented for any restaurant, not just McDonald's (the test case). That process will also be streamlined.
