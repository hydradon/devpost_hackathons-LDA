                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I come from an Industrial city and in the recent years, the problem of air pollution is becoming more and more relevant as the city is often covered in smog.
Recently city authorities have installed 9 stationary air quality sensors, but there are a few problems with those.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The sensors cost 5,000 USD and it is simply not viable to install them on every corner of the city to get diverse data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The sensors need to be checked and calibrated regularly which can be hard since they are often installed in hard-to-reach areas.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project that I built allows you to connect a flying drone with a sensor remotely so that civil oversight can identify the need to replace stationary sensors in the field, without having to regularly send an engineer on site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It shows how you can create a drone base that will be controlled by an Ethereum computer and solve a problem of trust to the sensor network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Transfer control over an autonomous drone base to an Ethereum computer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Specify which external owned accounts are authorized to launch missions on a drone base
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upload the mission GPS reference points to IPFS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send a transaction to create a mission smart contract using the hash from the last step
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone takes off to deliver a mission from IPFS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the drone returns, it publishes environmental analysis data to IPFS
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I developed this service as a business application of an economics framework for mobile robotics that I am working on. I plan to develop this project into a fully functioning solution that will allow reducing the cost of calibrating stationary air pollution sensors, as well as give an opportunity to collect much more diverse data in a city.
