                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Postmen often try to deliver packages, but the receiver is not at home. 
Customers wait for their packages or have to go to a far away post station if they miss the postmen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nile optimizes the delivery process on both sides:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        effective delivery for the delivery service, no more unnecessary walks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        customer has one portal for all the packages he awaits and is offered a live tracking system, so he can plan accordingly and if he is not at home, he knows beforehand where the package is delivered
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app for Android.
Works for customer and deliverer side. On the customer side we have the registration and a live tracking of the packages in a list and on a map. GPS data is sent automatically to the server on request to determine if the person is at home or not. If the receiver is at home, is is notified that a package is close, if not the best neighbour is selected and the receiver is notified after the package was successfully delivered to the neighbour. On the deliverer side we have a registration and the next address for the current package is shown and the coordinates are marked on a map. The GPS data is sent periodically every 400msec.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backend with Django.
To easily create and connect to the database needed for this project, we setted up a server working with the Django RESTful API. This way the clients can send and request data via HTTP methods. 
While constantly receiving data for the deliverers we needed the client data only in special cases, there we use Googles Firebase Servers for requesting client informations.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already have a running prototype where a server and an android app work perfectly together.
Most of us were inexperienced with android programming, but we built an app from scatch over night, which fulfils our needs.
Also we were not used to set up servers and the necessary communication, but we did it.
We worked as a team, we surprised ourself with what we created in such a short time when working hard and had fun doing so.

                    Android App programming, Server with Django, using the HERE API, think hard to come up with a great idea that is at the same time practicable
