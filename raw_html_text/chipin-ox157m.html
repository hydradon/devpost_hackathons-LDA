                        Achieving food security

                    <li>
                        Achieving improved nutrition
and finally and, in our case, most importantly: promoting sustainable agriculture
Hence the Problem/Challenge was &mdash;&gt; how can we use technology to promote sustainable agriculture?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So we came up with ChipIn, an android mobile application that helps raise funds for small-scale farmers allowing them to have equal access to more advanced and sustainable agricultural practices.
In simpler words, we are helping raise money to &ldquo;revamp&rdquo; the agricultural scene in Egypt narrowing our scope to small scale farmers who happen to make up about 90% of Egyptʼs farmersʼ sector (the ones that own &lt;= 3 acres).
So here we have Ahmad.
Ahmad has heard about the smart irrigation system his friend Mahmoud started using and how it helped boost his production.
All Ahmad has to do is go the agricultural organization in his town and apply fill out an order request.
The  agricultural organization will contact us and we will help promote the case, and collect donations for Ahmad.
Now Ahmad has sufficient funds to start his own project, adopting a more sustainable agricultural practice.
Now for the cherry on top, Om Islam has six kids, she needs money, she heard about how profitable a poultry farm could be. So she went to her villageʼs agricultural organization and filled out an order request, same as with Ahmad, Om Islam now has sufficient funds to start her own small business.

                    ChipIn provides a seamless navigation experience, where you land on a map showing projects all around Egypt as pin markers. Then you have explore, a screen that previews all of the projects that are running (still accepting donations) at the very moment. It provides a preview of the process involved in achieving the target of the project, and shows how far along the execution of the project is, and how much money has been and ought to be raised for that specific project. Then, you have the option to Chip In the project cost!

                    Another aspect of promoting sustainable agriculture that we tackled was the lack of awareness of the importance of the agricultural domain. We ourselves, had no idea what big of an impact agriculture has on food production here in Egypt. So through the app, we provided two features dedicated to solely to address it.
That little section right there (UN goals), and the &ldquo;did you know&rdquo; notifications. They provide people an incentive to invest in that area that is widely neglected.

                    It must be noted that the donations provided by the people for the cases is not charity. For the farmers, it is more or less a loan, that they ought to pay back to their agricultural organization. i.e. a revolving fund
