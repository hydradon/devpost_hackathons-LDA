                    Though authorizing documents has reduced down to a click, that's still a hazzle for select elderly and differently abled.

                    What's better than signing a document... well electronic signatures are (said DocuSign in 2008). 
What's better than e-signatures that demand a click you ask? A completely hands-free way maybe...

                    How we built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We built our bot using dialog-flow by Google. It functions with the help of Docusign API which gives it its skillz with the docz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Heroku as our backend and our web-server was made using Python backed by Flask API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've used other APIs including Selenium, gensim and pypdf2 to aid us in our conquests.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It was great working with all the API and learning and integrating everything over the past two days. 
We definitely encountered what seemed like a dead-end, more than once. But since we are a team of friends who didn't give up on each other and we managed to pull through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of our hurdles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No api interface to add a signature to pdf
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Firebase options being limited with the free account
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We tackled quite a few technologies which we weren't exactly familiar with.
We didn't back down and didn't let sleep get to us :)
We were able to make a working POC which will hopefully turn into something which many deem useful
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What we learned
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We have not worked on DialogFlow before but all of us are well aware of the concept of Natural Language Understanding. This was a new take on things and was fun learning and working with. Definitely a skill we are proud to have now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were initially exploring speaker diarization which made us explore a lot many math models, which was cool.
                </p>

                    We hope to use speaker diarization and speaker identification models, to add a robust layer of security, to standardize
