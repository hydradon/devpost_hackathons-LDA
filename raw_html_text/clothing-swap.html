                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a marketplace to make clothing recycling easy. We built this for people that have clothes they want to get rid of and those transitioning who need a new wardrobe. Our product offers an environmentally friendly alternative to getting clothes and getting rid of clothes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow people who are transitioning to trade old clothes and receive new gender-affirming ones
Allow people to get clothes that they might otherwise not be able to afford
Give people an option to reduce their waste
