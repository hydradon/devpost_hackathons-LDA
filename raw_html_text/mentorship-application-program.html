                    The inspiration for this program is my school, Engineering Technology Academy (E.T.A) @ Roosevelt High School, and my Gold Award project for Girl Scouts. For the past year I have been speaking and developing a mentorship program alongside my counselor for our program and have decided to also use it to achieve my gold status as a Girl Scout.

                    The program is at its first stage in which it collects data, processes it, collects the data, then sends the information to a sender via e-mail. I built the program script in HTML and combined Java Script to allow for the data transfer with a component system called EmailJS.

                    The biggest challenges I faced was one learning HTML5, before last night I hadn't worked with it before, most of my projects have been done in Python. The other major problem I faced was finding a way to transfer the data collected from the HTML program to a stored location that could be read and used for the pairing of students.I'm proud of myself for learning this new language and not  being afraid to ask the mentors and my peers for assistance when I got stuck, their help made the process easier and we found solutions that I wouldn't have thought of myself.

                    Next for Mentorship Application Program I hope to finish the program to instead connect to a spread sheet that will use another program or algorithm to pair the students and I hope to implement it in my school and us it to start a mentorship program at my school before I graduate..
