                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to do something with drones and image recognition since we were really interested in those technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes images and gps coordinates from drones and gives each location a priority based on whether or not there are people and water in the image. It also takes into account the elevation of the location to determine which locations have higher priority. The program uses Google Maps API to mark each location with its determined order then outputs a link to the marked map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, several of Google Maps APIs, and Clarifai's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting Maven to work. Also, we had trouble finding images that would be typical of a drone shot since currently, drones are only recently being used to take images during hurricane rescue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really happy when we finally got Maven to work properly. It was our first time having to use it. Working with Clarifai's API and integrating it with Google Maps API to generate our results was cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a new idea is not the easiest thing, and 36 hours is not a lot of time. We are more comfortable using APIs to seamlessly create data we can use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hurricane Drone Imaging Mapping
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we are looking at more criteria we could add to make the priority system more efficient and just better all around.
