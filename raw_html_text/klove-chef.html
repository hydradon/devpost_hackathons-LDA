                <p>
                    Klove Chef is on the mission to bring back home cooking.  With busy schedules, many people eat unhealthy fast food and take out on a daily basis.  We want to make it easy for people to find recipes that are personalized for them, show them the ease of cooking, and reduce the fear of not knowing how to make a healthy meal at home.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the same way that Google Maps helps people get to point A to point B, Klove Chef provides people with a natural way of finding recipes, shopping for ingredients and effortlessly cooking those recipes at home.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Klove Chef was built as a recipe platform for everything food and beverage, through voice and natural learning processing.

                <p>
                    Voice technology is new to a lot of people.  We needed to first educate our first partners on the potential of the technology and how rapidly it is growing.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Aside from cooking, Klove Chef is excited to jump into the beverage space, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic.
