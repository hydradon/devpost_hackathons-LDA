                <h2>
                    Inspiration: To help in cities like Detroit where it can often be crowded, or public transportation may take a while, having a network where you can have a more reliable ride in a pinch may help ease some of that stress.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: We developed a we app for users to post a need for a ride, this goes to a backend system we wrote and communicates with the gm-dashboard api to alert a driver who may be willing to carpool with someone they know or may not know.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to communicate from the GM-client navagation api to the server. Google maps and ember.js for the front end that users use to request a ride, and the backend written in Ruby.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Working with a buggy beta in the GM api. Short on time, tired, large parts, building individual parts that needed to be able to communicate with json across levels.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Code for communicated with the GM api pretty much complete, looks nice on sdk, but not so much on actual dash. Accomplished the front end with a google api, only problem was a bug in the ember code that a member had learned in a day and used for the entire front end, this though did make us unable to completely run and test our program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Downloading files sucks when 1997 other people are sharing the same wifi connection.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Car Pool: Not sure, depends if GM wants to see it turned into something greater.
