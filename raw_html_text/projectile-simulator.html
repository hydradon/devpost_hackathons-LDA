                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two thirds of our team are physics nerds.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates a satellite moving around earth.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java with frame and math (trigonometry) and physics formulas.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Errors in our math.  We initially used formulas that we formatted incorrectly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Just getting this project off the ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to fully develop the idea before starting our code, especially working in a team.  We started our code before figuring out our implementation.
                </p>

                    What's next for Projectile Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add more planets and make a kerbal space program - esque project.
