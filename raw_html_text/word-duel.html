                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various brain-teasing word games gave us the idea for a unique letter placing game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WordDuel is an interactive grid based game that encourages users to create words while preventing their opponent from doing so themselves. Two players can play each other, or one user can play against a bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled the project with purely java, using the output console to scan and display the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first idea for a project was unfeasible and too long. After working for several hours into the evening, we reviewed our progress and unanimously decided to abort the project and create something simpler.
Getting the bot code to work properly took more time and effort than anticipated. Corner cases were challenging to cover, but we were able to smooth them out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a working bot was especially exciting, but seeing the game operate overall made us proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that conjuring a feasible project is as important as working efficiently. From our first failed project, we learned that attempting to process data between java and javascript is not efficient or easy to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Word-Duel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the bot's capabilities to predict movements and see ahead are some goals for this project's future. Adding a better user interface would make the game more interesting.
