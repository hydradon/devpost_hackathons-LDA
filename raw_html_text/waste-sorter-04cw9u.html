                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We personally had trouble during the hackathon figuring out which waste bin to place items in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans an item and tells the user if it should be disposed in the recycling, compost, and trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a python script that first scans the webcam for an image, analyzes that to Google Vision api to return keywords, and then we organized those keywords into the categories of recycling, compost, and trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how exactly to use the Google Vision api to help reach our conclusions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating the Google Vision api and building our own sorting beyond that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good idea need to be iterated a few times
It's okay to try out new things, you might be surprised what you learn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Waste Sorter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uploading the code onto a server to be able to provide continual updates, and completing the front end experience. Additionally, adding automatic detection when to scan, instead of requiring the user to click a button.
