                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relying on Dropbox to access files can be hassle. Whether Dropbox is undergoing maintenance or you cannot access the Internet, we wanted a cloud-like solution for this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The RaspberryPi is able to copy all files from Dropbox, so you can accesss them if needed. Basically a backup of Dropbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Dropbox API/SDK, Python, Supervisor.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcoming the lack of thorough documentation of the DropBox API. An unfamiliarity with Python made the project even more challenging, but just as fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many important concepts when writing programs in Python. We also learned how to directly work with an SDK or API
                </p>

                    What's next for Pi Box
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will create documentation with a configuration file, and fix the hosting by Supervisor as a Daemon.
