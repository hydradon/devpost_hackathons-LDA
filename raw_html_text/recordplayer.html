                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the complete archive of currently 155.000 records on archive.org. There are some great originals but it's tedious to manually go through the whole collection by hand on your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill plays some carefully selected songs from the Great 78 Project and let's you rate them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we built our own database of the archive and listened to loads of them. With this initial collection we started to build the skill. The collection steadily improved through the user ratings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the records are mostly from the years 1900 to 1960 and don't have copyrights any more but it first had to be proved to Amazon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first skill! And I have some friends that liked it so much that they bought their own Alexa for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried a lot of tools for creating and testing the skill, having the right setup greatly simplified the process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're constantly adding more records to the collection.
