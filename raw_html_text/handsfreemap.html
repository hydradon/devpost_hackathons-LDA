                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to use a map without requiring you to touch your device. This is done using voice commands such as "zoom in" and "move left".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio along with the Google Maps API and built in voice recognition libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to use LEAP motion to allow for the user to manipulate the map using hand gestures, but we ran into complications with time while attempting to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app successfully recognizes simple commands and follows accordingly.
                </p>

                    What's next for HandsFreeMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may try to use LEAP motion to make for simpler use as well as adding the ability to search for routes to a destination.
