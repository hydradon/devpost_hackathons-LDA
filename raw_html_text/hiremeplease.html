                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen, we were eager to step foot and dive into the world of computer science. Having seen how technology has helped made the world a better place, we want to make our own marks in the world. But how do we get started? What better way than through internships that provides us with an amazing platform to immerse in the hacker culture! But applying for jobs and scouring through tons and tons of websites can be really draining and monotonous. So we decided to put our skills to good use as a stepping stone to help us get our very first gig!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our smart automated telegram bot will scrape multiple job portals and filter out the most relevant jobs! The user can then choose which jobs to apply to and the bot will automatically send their resume to potential employers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from our own coding skills and amazingness, we got some help from the pyTelegramBotAPI, Selenium, and Firebase! We coded this project in Python!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though pyTelegramBotAPI is really useful and functional, the documentations were sparse. That made it hard for us to understand the tools and how to use them as the syntax were a little different from the core Telegram API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to understand the framework behind messaging systems such as Telegram, and utilised its versatility to automate tasks that we thought were really difficult to do!
We also understood more about how websites work through Javascript and CSS, and how servers and clients spoke to one another such that some data require a client to load the javascript before data would be represented on the client's browser.
We were not familiar with git too, and learning to use the CLI made us feel like real hackers!
Most of all, we are super proud of the fact that we finished this feat within 24 hours! The bot is fully functional, and we intend to use it for ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork makes the dream work! All of us stayed up throughout the duration of the project and supported one another, be it through researching or bringing snacks! We realised we could not have done it alone, and the morale support was crucial to the building of the project!
On the technical aspect, we learned that coding can be enjoyable and frustrating at times! But all in all, fortune rewards those who persistently try to find documentations and read them before asking!!!
                </p>
