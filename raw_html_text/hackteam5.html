                    When we arrived to PENNAPPS we were all ready for a weekend full of programming, learning, as well as enjoyable experiences. However, none of us had a team. Each of us were more than eager to get started and finding people who shared the same interests and scope in programming proved to be challenging. So our problem/project was in front of our noses. We needed to develop a web application that is accessible to organize  teams and prepare for HACKATHONS.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allow users to provide their own profile, create their own teams, and search for teams they want to join depending on their areas of interest, current skill sets and preference for other group members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end framework using npm and angular, and the back-end framework using Firebase and JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    And we finally made it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully in the future, this webapp can be applied to multiple hackathons including PennApps and HackCMU (which will be held next week).
