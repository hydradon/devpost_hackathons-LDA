                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always liked older equipment and was inspired by videos of some people online using old equipment for music
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes midi files/signals and creates a frequency to match a note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disasembling the floppy drives, pinning out each drive, and creating custom cable for the drives
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes music
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That my original ideas for this event where either too complex of folllow through with procedures was lackinng. (i.e, too tired to function properly)
                </p>
