                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned from our experiences at school that essay grading today is highly inefficient and subjective. With machine learning taking on a rapidly increasing number of roles in our daily lives, we decided to implement an artificial intelligence system through machine learning to automate the essay grading process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our machine learning model is built into a simple website. Students or teachers can paste in an essay into a text box, and it is run through a robust model trained on thousands of past student essays to determine a score. Currently, it is evaluated as pass or fail to allow students to determine whether they need to spend more time on their essay. We will soon expand to produce a numerical grade on a scale from 1 to 12.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of our model is built in Python. We used the library NLTK for the natural language processing functionality to analyze the text. We trained a decision tree model on the Kaggle Hewlett Foundation essay grading dataset for classification. All Python was done in a Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda. Our website is built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will integrate the machine learning model into an API to connect it to the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some difficulties in training our model initially, as our accuracy was far lower than we expected. Through adding additional features for analysis and experimenting with a variety of model structures, we were able to greatly improve the accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have figured out how to successfully train a robust model despite only one team member having prior experience in machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We greatly expanded our knowledge of machine learning, natural language processing, and web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Write It Right
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our number one goal is to provide more precise feedback in the form of a grade from 1 to 12. We also want to improve our overall accuracy, and use an API to integrate the model into our website.
