                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Desire for quicker development in IoT for anyone who doesn't want to reinvent the wheel each time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This API utilizes the wireless shield "Yun" for the Arduino, using it as a server to make REST calls to the Arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino Provided some templates for REST servers, So I created the computer/mobile/device interface with Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I accidentally wiped the bootloader off of the Microcontroller on the Arduino while trying to upload some templates with incorrect settings, which were a huge inconvenience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compared to last time, I reformed this code to be very user friendly and well formatted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about HTTP requests and responses as well as microcontroller commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ArduinoYunAPI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More functions to use, along with libraries and effectively using the ASYNC functions.
