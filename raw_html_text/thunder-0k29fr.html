                    We make best-in-class business services easily available to SMBs.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been running a startup for a little over a year and have experienced first-hand how much time is spent on administrative and overhead tasks, even for a very small team. We've used a large variety of different specialised tools, such as Buffer, Asana, QuickBooks etc. and although they are each individually amazing at solving the problem they address, each additional one adds complexity in terms of platform knowledge and overall corporate infrastructure overhead. Building a dashboard-like tool that integrates our business-critical services and tools is something we've discussed for a while, and this Hackathon seemed like the perfect opportunity to start development on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform primarily consists of a serverless cloud infrastructure, that at it's core manages and consolidates federated user identities. We've connected this with several microservices we've written that integrate with various third-party services over oauth2. We've also built a modest front-end client that provides an easy-to-use GUI for accessing the services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was that we had misunderstood the timeline for obtaining API keys to various Ad platforms (Snap, Facebook, Google) and have as of now, not been able to get them / implement Ad services on our platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scope of the cloud infrastructure/microservices we built; we set out to make services that were more targeted in terms of use-case than those provided by automation platforms such as Zapier &amp; IFTT and we feel like we especially accomplished this with our QuickBooks accounting module as well as our Twitter Lead module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of researching what other SMBs struggle with, in comparison to our experiences, we learned a lot about the issues of cash-flow for many B2B SMBs, an issue of which we were largely unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Thunder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting API keys from the ad platforms so we can fully integrate our accounting/budgeting module with our ad automation module. This is a core part of our plan for the platform, as it ties together with many of our add-on modules for content creation and allows users to 'one-click' begin using our suite of services.
