                    Blueprint is a mobile app created to help individuals with disabilities keep track of their daily activities and establish healthy habits. Blueprint aims to empower users who need assistance to complete certain tasks by including video tutorials of every activity. Our goal is to help users complete tasks without the assistance of an aid or family member, promoting their self confidence and independence. We designed our app to reinforce healthy habits each time a user opens it up with distinct color patterns and multiple representations of users' daily progress. By attributing a point system to your daily routine, Blueprint makes everyday activities like brushing your teeth engaging and rewarding.

                    Our team had a blast developing Blueprint from scratch during BrickHack4! It was many of our members first experience developing with react-native and we all feel we learned a ton, especially from the many errors and issues faced along the way. We strongly feel our app can benefit the lives of many. Please give it a try with the GitHub link below!
