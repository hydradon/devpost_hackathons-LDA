                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today many refugees and international students could find the trouble to misunderstand how to contribute to sustainability in society due to the lack of knowledge about recycling systems that many Canadians do every day. In light of this, our goal is to develop games on our website that cater towards all ages including kids where all the games are fun and educational to spread sustainability awareness.

                <p>
                    Our website page is called hackhousegames.com where all of the games on the website revolve around environmental sustainability. One of the games we developed is called Snake Versus Sustainability which is based on the popular game of Snake by eating the fruit to grow and accumulate points, but with the twist of staying avoiding hazardous waste.
