                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the idea from my kids singing jingles that they learned from school.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa forces you to use only certain launch phrases, so I have to say:  Alexa, ask singing jingle about nouns.  I would rather get it to say, Alexa, start singing jingle about nouns.
