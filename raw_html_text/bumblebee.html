                    Inspiration :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -traffic jam and accidents: due to talk of correction/co-ordination among drives
(the less we give way, the messier.)
-Learn from nature: herd animals (bees,fishes,birds) in formation never collide.
-communication among members in the hand,school,colony,pack ,community,by sound,signals,dance.
-A bee when it finds food, tells to community where it is = In road traffic, when an accident is.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an IoT system for road safety and traffic automatically detect potential danger and communicate with peer systems on other cars on the road, for adjustments to assist the driver.  Preventive measures shift to traffic accidents,  Messages will be sent to a Traffic Accident Response Centre for appropriate actions, depending on the corrected urgency and priority, as analyzed by the device on the car.
                </p>

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sensors:
1 ultrasonic sensor: distance between cars
2 guyro sensor:if the car has flipped over
3 airbag sensor: expanded function
4 touch/bumper sensor : panic button 
5 accelerometer: abrupt changes in car speed
PHP X AMPP: the data base
Dreamweaver: user interface for the Traffic Accident Response Centre
