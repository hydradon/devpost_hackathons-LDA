                    Col-GateKeepers is a team of motivated aspiring engineers who strive to better the world one program at a time.
                    <br>
                    The team consists of 4 core members:
                    <br>
                    Harvey Zhang, a 1st-year Computer Engineering student
                    <br>
                    Vikram Vijayakumar, a 2nd-year Computer Science student
                    <br>
                    Sukhjit Singh, a 3rd- year Electrical Engineering student
                    <br>
                    Bhargav Singaraju, a 3rd-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how machine learning works towards our design.
                    <br>
                    Learning web design and the ways it interacts with the back-end of our code
                    <br>
                    Designing the website to have simple but effective UI
                    <br>
                    Connecting our back-end code to our front-end code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Html to create a website
                    <br>
                    How to use Github to create a repository
                    <br>
                    Hosting our domain from Github
                    <br>
                    We used Flask to allow our back-end code to interact with our front-end code
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Estimates the price of toothpaste based on the brand, country, unit size, and packaging size using data science and machine learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    If we had more time...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were able to work on our project longer, we would have been able to create a better-looking UI for our program. We also could have connected our UI to our program using the web framework, Flask, since the framework would provide a way to link our front-end code to our back-end code.
