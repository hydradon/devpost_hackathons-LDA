                    Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Not thinking about specific healthcare needs, but focusing on raising the average quality of everyday conduct - We set out to notify people of the local air quality and noise pollution when choosing a place of rest or prolonged location stays.
With low air quality, let it be rising CO2 levels or higher Fine Particles counts - quality of work and mental ability are bound to suffer. Noise Pollution inhibits a restful sleep and breaks, or manages to minimize their positive effects.
These are some of the reasons why we came up with our idea, where users can seek out the needed information for an unintrusive method of increasing the likelihood of staying in surroundings which benefit their lives.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How It Works
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A monitored room or location is one which is equipped with one of our sensor units. These units contain sensors which record and send current metrics and data to our server (Amazon AWS). Recorded metrics and can be expanded to include: 
inside temperature, outside temperature, temperature delta, outside air quality, outside fine particles count, inside CO2 levels, inside noise levels. 
Joining these with externally sourced data, we can give recommendations for users who want to proactively participate in a healthier environment. For others users, it will purely focus on awareness for better living.
Users are able to monitor rooms and location through different interfaces. Implemented so far are the Telegram Messenger, which makes use of software buttons for swift interaction.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Use Cases
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Monitoring the &lsquo;vitals&rsquo; of a room, hall, or building and changing variables which influence the recorded metrics leads to a change in individual behavior and performance. Low CO2 Levels as an example negatively impact human decision making performance and in cases lead to dysfunctional or at least reduced performance. 
Performance factors include: basic activity, applied activity, task orientation, initiative, information orientation, information utilization, breadth of approach, and basic strategy.
Thus, event spaces, co-working spaces, conferences, schools, training centers, and other places where mental ability is of the essence will greatly benefit from our idea.

                    Cost
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Upfront cost of between 10 to 120 Eur / room in hardware tech and one server (RaspberryPi) 35 Eur.
