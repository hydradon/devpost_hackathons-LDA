                <p>
                    This project helps health organizations identify outbreaks as they develop by flagging irregularities in individuals' habits through monitoring their phones' pinging of wifi routers.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disease outbreaks affect hundreds of millions of lives and cost billions of dollars to deal with. The CDC reports that the US economy loses $90bn to flu outbreaks. By analyzing individuals' change in habits, we can provide more effective care and policies that are based on real-time data of outbreak progression.

                <p>
                    Generates test data and analyzes and provides data of anomalies to discover when people are getting sick before they are diagnosed by a doctor and go and buy medicine.
