                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about news and the ways people can access them and realized that there isn't really something that shows based on relevance. This website would allow users to access articles and news from all different platforms, not just one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user types in a keyword or a subject that they want to read about. What will pop up would be articles that are sorted based on relevance. The most relevant articles would be in the bigger bubbles and the less relevant would therefore be in the smaller ones. Once the user clicks on the bubble then they would be directed to the article itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a front end and a back end. The front end was produced using HTML and CSS. The back end was produced by using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of problems with merge errors and how we gathered the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our work as a team. We all think that we worked very well with each other and learned a lot. It was good that we have a final product to show!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of HTML and CSS as well as how to decode ASCII.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bubble News
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to include pictures so that the users can have a visual of what they are going to be clicking on. Additionally, we want to make some of the features more efficient!
