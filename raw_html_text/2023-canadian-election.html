                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the drive to learn how the blockchain system works; along with the motivation to learn good programming style. We also wanted to explore how AI can be used to accomplish everyday tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a blockchain based system to securely calculate the number of votes cast by voters who registered in our website. We also have a chatbox which uses machine learning to answer queries related to the election.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of programming languages to put this project into motion, along with several scripting languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to wrap our heads around the blockchain system before we could do any of the programming, and we had to figure out how to use FTP to launch our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how the blockchain system works; learning how to launch a fully fledged, designed website onto the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several programming techniques related to blockchain development, and several scripting language techniques for website development.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to refine this project and hone our programming and scripting language techniques.
