                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an avid fan of rhythm games, I was motivated to make one that in involved a competitive aspect to it so players could test each other's rhythmic skills heat-to-head.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clapper is a one-versus-one rhythm game where the players alternate improving a rhythm while their opponent must mimic the rhythm as best as possible. Once each player has played and performed three rhythms, the winner is chosen by the player who has the least amount of misses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clapper was made in c++ using the SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer) development library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that I ran into was keeping the game in sync with the music itself. As the game continued for long periods of time, the game would progressively get more out of sync with the music. This issue was solved by resetting the music every sixteen measures, however I believe there are better solutions to the issue. Additionally, this is the first game I have finished programming, so it was challenging as I had little previous experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I am proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I finished the project within the allotted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that within rhythm games, the song's time position is used for almost everything that drives the game. Additionally, as this was my first game that I have made, it taught me the general process and format of creating a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clapper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of cleaner visuals as well as a more accurate timing system.

                <h2>
                    Trying it out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before trying it out, note that this game requires the SDL2, SDL_ttf 2.0, and SDL_mixer 2.0 libraries
