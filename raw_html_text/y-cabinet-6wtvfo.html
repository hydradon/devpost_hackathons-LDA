                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get the inspiration from the idea provided by Stanley Black&amp;Decker, which is to show users how would the product like in real place and in real size using AR technic. We choose to solve this problem because we also encounter same problem in our daily life. When we are browsing website for buying furnitures or other space-taking product, the first wonders that we come up with is always these two: How much room would it take and would it suit the overall arrangement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides customer with 3D models of products which they might be interested in and enable the customers to place, arrange (move and rotate) and interact with these models in their exact size in reality space to help they make decision on whether to buy it or not.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We use iOS AR kit.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to enable the change of size and color of a series/set of products directly in AR view, without the need to go back to choose. We also want to make the products look more realistic by finding a way to add light and shadow to it.
