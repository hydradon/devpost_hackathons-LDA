                    It made it to inspire people to explore places that are not that well known during travel. We wanted to design a platform where people could come together, share their journeys and expeditions and allow others to explore them, attempt them and critique them.

                    Fliffo is a React Native application that acts as a proof of concept for our idea. It has multiple features built into it, including a tool to submit new ideas for trip plans, a tool of how swiping through a normal trip would work, a profile page for a user of the application and a page showing a list of friends of the user, that the user can interact with and share with.

                <p>
                    We built Fliffo using Expo. It&rsquo;s written in Javascript (JSX), and React Native.

                    The entire point for us to make this app was to learn about how React Native works and build our skills in frontend development. We had very little React experience before coming into building this.

                <p>
                    We encountered challenges at almost every step of the building process. We had problems making sure our form for entries would write to firebase, and that our

                <p>
                    Fliffo is an idea that we&rsquo;re really proud of &ndash; people either spend a lot of money on travel guides or spend a lot of time on making their own travel plans. Many times, these plans turn out to be bad or miss out on a lot of great locals wonders people might not know about. Fliffo helps discover and curate magical pockets around the world created by local guides and top planners, everyone will get the best travel experience possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a platform, there are many opportunities for people to share their best travel moments to everyone in the world. For now, specifically adding a ratings system will help users better understand which plans are the best, and brands and local businesses support will help improve business and also recognition around the world.
