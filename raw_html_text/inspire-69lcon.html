                    Mental health issues are very serious. As a student, it is easy to feel down on a bad day. This can accumulate to become mental health problems. Sometimes we just need a small cheer-up or inspiration to feel bright for a long time, but this may not be always available. Either ourselves or our friends can be busy, or physically distant. This is why I made this skill so that users can ask for an inspiration easily, to feel better, relieving mental health pressure.
