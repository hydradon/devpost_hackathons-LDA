                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the fact that almost the entirety of our UMD diner still uses paper and pencil information methods. We wanted to increase the value of connection between the user and the Dining Services. We thought that increasing the availability of food nutrition facts would help people better understand what they are eating, and how they could improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 main features persist within our app:
1).We can use a QR code scanner to get nutritional facts data pulled from the UMD dining services, displayed simply.
2).We have a menu system that will tell you what food items will be on the menu the next day, as opposed to the main food item list, which holds all food items.
3).We have implemented a polling system that utilizes a cookie-based sign in system that requires a student ID to access. The polling System polls what special food items will be the most wanted based on user input.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time for many things. Our first time for Frontend/Backend Integration.
Our first time using cookies to make a from-scratch sign in system. Some of it took more time to implement than next time should.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend was very clean and very well made thanks to Mahir. It might just be proof of concept, but the technology is still very original. I'm also quite proud of the CSS involved with the project on my end, even if not everyone made it to the final product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of things about languages, Integrating Systems, CSS, user interface, concepts. We have learned so much.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dining@UMD

                <p>
                    Hopefully UMD will have something to say about it.
