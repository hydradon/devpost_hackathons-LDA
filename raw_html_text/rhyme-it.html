                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever there is a new Alexa feature, I always jump at the chance to try it out. So when the ISP feature came about, I wanted to make a skill that incorporates that. I wanted to make a rhyming word game and then with the ISP feature, the user can expand their game by buying packs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rhyme it is a word game where Alexa will give you a word and you find another that will rhyme with it. Every time you give a correct answer you get a point. You also have the opportunity to battle it out and play against friends and family. If the user wants, they can buy lives to help them beat their high score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used NodeJS, ask-sdk v2, cli for the isp feature and consumables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was a new feature of using ISPs and APL I had to learn two new features. Also because ISP is only currently available in the US, It was hard to test it in the UK so testing was a major issue. I also noticed with the ISP feature, there were a lot more required intents and requirements needed to submit the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm so proud that I managed to make a skill which implements both ISP and APL. APL definitely enhances gameplay on the screen devices but I'm glad I have still focused on making it a voice first driven skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned how to make ISP and Multimodal skills and will continue to make more in the future as I definitely think more and more consumers will interact with both voice and screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rhyme It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am hoping to add more word packs for users and in the future online multiplayer and a leaderboard.
