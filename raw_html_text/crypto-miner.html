                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always thought to ourselves that it would've been to great if we had invested in crypto-currencies early in it's infancy phase. This gave us an idea to use historical cryptocurrency data and create a game where we let a user manage a cryptocurrency portfolio, with mining capabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Prizes we are aiming for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *
                    <em>
                        Information overload, Head in the clouds
We are putting historical cryptocurrency data into the hands of user to better understand how the market was and how a person running such a venture experienced. Hence we are making a part of world's information more accessible.

                    </em>
                    Dream about dollars
We better educate users about cryptocurrency through our game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game works on a timeline controlled by our backend server, which feeds the current time and prices to the client applications. The clients can buy crypto-currency or mine it after buying miners
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ReactJS to create the frontend (since we saw a lot of elements can be composed into components) and we used an Express/NodeJS backend which polls cryptocompare to get the data, formats it and sends it over to clients listening to this server. The backend server is hosted on Google App Engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Deployment, and the general game design: scaling difficulty to correspond to market events, and making sure the game is not too tough or hard, and most importantly its' fun.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is fully deployed and we feel we make a very accurate product of our prototype which we feel is pretty cool
                </p>
