                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ibrahim did a lot of projects with regards to fractals and math, and so because we all wanted to learn how to program 3D environments we decided to go with this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a whole bunch of mathematical objects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wrote this in C++ using OpenGL libraries, but due to much of our code not working we transferred at the last minute to a C# equivalent, using one of our teammates' old projects from high school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main issue was getting our 3D environment working, we spent most of the time learning about OpenGL rather than actually programming it due to the amount of issues we got.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a 3D environment working! It took 3D and a whole lot of grit and late nights but it was managed eventually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenGL is a vast and dangerous realm to be in, it will require more than 3 days to fully learn it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fractal Terrain Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out a better interface is our top priority, and getting our random noise generators down.
