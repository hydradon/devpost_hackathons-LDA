                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google is easily the most important website on the internet, and for Halloween I thought it would be nice if it were a little bit more than that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boogle is a self-made creepy "spirit" you can ask questions about your future and about her past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built completely from scratch, in a program called Brackets,  Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of components I was excited to have didn't work as expected.  I spent about 1 1/2 hours on a simple design I ended up scrapping completely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Boogle logo is self made, code is self-written and characteristics of the "spirit" were self-thought.  Each question is carefully thought out, and finding new questions is easy.  Also I tried to make it as close as possible to the actual Google website, trying to be as close as possible without looking at the Google website source code. I payed extreme attention to detail.  Copying even the slightest detail from the Google website that you wouldn't even notice unless I pointed it out.  Also I tried my best for the website to work with all screen sizes, even though it was built on a larger screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tiny details arn't important until the program is actually functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Boogle - A spooky remake of Google.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to expand it far past this hackathon.  Sooner or later I want to make an Amazon Echo say the replies as well as the website itself.
