                    Our project is Healthy Friends, a web-based application optimized for mobile that allows people (specifically students at Georgia Tech) to find opportunities for physical activity by seeing when friend&rsquo;s post that they are engaging in something active, whether it be working out or playing frisbee outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People are more likely to engage in activities, especially more exertion heavy ones like working out when they have friends doing so as well to push them. By just seeing how active their friends are and what they are doing, they would be encouraged to spend time with them leading to healthier lifestyles for all. This ultimately would lead to a healthier, happier community, and can be expanded to include locations outside of Georgia Tech as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, if someone wants to work out, they usually have to text many of their friends, usually getting turned down. This app would fix that.
