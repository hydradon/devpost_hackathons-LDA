                <p>
                    A bricked hack intended to be a fallback in case our technically sound idea didn't get off the ground.
Sometimes you're in your 18th straight hour of wrestling with an online API, and just want to distract yourself for a while with the soothing act of literal brick hacking (albeit in a virtual sense). This little game scratches that itch just long enough to leave you refreshed and raring to head into your 19th hour! It is a niche market, to be sure - but we anticipate massive growth in demand with successive iterations of BrickHack and, as the word spreads, other hackathons around the world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Happy hacking!
