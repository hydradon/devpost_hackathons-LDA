                    Inspiration: Person of Interest TV show itself. We thought such an idea could be extended to serve a social and practical purpose in today's cities.

                    What it does: It is a Law enforcement assistant that aids police officials by providing them with an alerting mechanism to detect major past offenders in possible high risk areas. For eg: Past sex offenders in a children&rsquo;s playground. It is a civic hack that uses face detection and recognition on live security feed to enable police to tighten security in an area if required.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's say a person X with a history of major criminal offenses enters an area where the occupants might be especially at risk, such as children or senior citizens. In this case, based on severity of the past offenses, the police are alerted of the presence of person X in the locality. The police may choose to take appropriate measures such as tightening the security in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm categorizes crimes based on their degree of severity and color codes them accordingly.
