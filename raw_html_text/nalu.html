                <p>
                    For those times when you have trouble getting into major classes, it would help if UCSC had the tools to analyze all the course pathways and class sizes to ensure we can graduate on time.

                <p>
                    The possibilities for Nalu could be in the form of a mobile app that provides students themselves with the ability to see their routed graduation path even in the event that they are unavailable to get into some classes.
