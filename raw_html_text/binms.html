                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had many smoke detectors laying around my house, and I couldn't stop thinking of all the times in the dorm rooms where microwaving popcorn would turn into an evacuation. Fire alarms saves lives, but it can also be frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once a smoke detector goes off, you can yell commands to shut it down within a couple seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I Cracked open a smoke detector, and figured out how it works so I could intercept the signal. Connected a relay to the battery's positive wire, and the gPIo on a raspberry-pi. Coded the voice recognition program with the help of a Google API, and sent the signal to the relay. Duct Taped everything in cardboard to look like the smoke detector was attached to a ceiling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running the voice recognition continuously. Trying to figure out where to intercept the signal in the smoke detector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had an idea in mind and was able to not quit until I finished it. And I learned more about electrical, which is becoming a hobby of mine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use relays to intercept signals from a common IO board. Voice Recognition. And how smoke detectors work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BINMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it compact, and able to tell you to learn how to cook.
