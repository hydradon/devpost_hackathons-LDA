                    ** Inspiration**
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am driving alone on a highway/interstate and all of a sudden met with any emergency, which might be a crash or any health issue. The chances of getting noticed by someone or someone calling EMS for me are higher when compared to the same incident that happened in a route without frequent traffic, which will usually happen when we take routes without tolls. So, the chances of getting rescued are very minimal in such scenarios.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using Deep learning and facial recognition technology the user's (driver) face is continuously monitored. If there is any unusual activity captured, the application will beep an alarm in the driver's phone for a specific amount of time... if the unusual activity continues even after the alarm, the app will send a voice mail to EMS and the registered emergency contact number.
