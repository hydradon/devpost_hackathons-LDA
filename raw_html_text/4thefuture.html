                    A web app that aims to help displaced young girls aged 5 to 14 years, old providing them with a platform that tracks their education progress despite the unstable conditions they are facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app provides access to mentors that has a digital record of their learning progress. It is a system that helps improve learning experience despite their circumstance.  The mentors also guide each student through customized learning activities such as Video tutorials, Coursera, and WebVR activities.

                <p>
                    Back-end was developed in Java and was ported into a Web app with RestAPI and JQuery. We used frameworks and APIs from Coursera, IBM Watson, and Bootstrap along with AFrame, WebVR Framework for one of the demo activities which that utilizes Speech to Text function done in Javascript.
