                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with experienced workers from the refugee field we realized how crucial the problem of building a secure identity is for refugees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a secure place on blockchain where a refugee can collect identity data and get it verified by trusted people during her journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Syncano.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints and managing to narrow down on one of all those problems a refugee faces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to work with people we had never worked with before and that we were able to have fun for 36 hours.
                </p>

                    Learned a lot about blockchain and the difficulties of refugees and displaced people.
