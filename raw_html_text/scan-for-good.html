                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wondered how environmentally responsible your favorite companies are? We definitely have! Our vision was to make this carbon footprint data very accessible to the general public, without having to wade through datasets and news articles. By simply scanning a barcode, anybody can get access to this information within seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app takes a live camera stream and uses an API that can recognize any in-frame UPC barcodes. Armed with the barcode information, we track down the manufacturer and pull up their most recent climate change score and CO2 emissions records, to display on the page for the user to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got blocked by trying to resolve CORS errors and had some trouble appropriate and accessible APIs. We ended up creating 5 different accounts to get temporary UPC lookup API access :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to put so many moving parts together -- although most of the tools we needed were available online, linking API lookup to database search and more was an extremely delicate and finicky process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scan for Good
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to populate the results with even more information (Department of Labor statistics on income disparity, waste productivity, etc.) and build out the UI to be more intuitive and smooth.
