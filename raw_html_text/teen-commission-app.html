                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this to show our appreciation for the teen commission and how they organize these amazing events for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lists all the upcoming events, has a forum where teens can ask questions, an about the commission page, and a profile page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on four separate devices and them merged them into one app. We used MIT App Inventor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were making a forum and the event page.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to work together and use something that we have never used before to code something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use MIT App Inventor, importance of staying on task, and numerous other things.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Teen Commission App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we want for our app is that the teen commission shows a small profile for each one of them, contact info, a better forum, and anything that the city thinks is valuable to use, and also an iOS form of the app.
