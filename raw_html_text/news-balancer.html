                <p>
                    Today, America is more misinformed and divided than ever. With the increasing prevalence of pseudo-news websites such as BuzzFeed, incorrect news sources and politically biased articles stand in the way of a clear understanding of contemporary issues. Furthermore, the absence of differing viewpoints in today's media has led to echochambers in which peoples prejudices and beliefs are repeatedly confirmed. This leads to a lack of understanding between different groups that can breed discrimination and intolerance.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    News Balancer takes any story or article and provides numerous credible articles on that story sorted by their political bias. The homepage will randomly generate a story from its archives, and display different articles along with their bias and credibility so the user can easily scan multiple viewpoints at once. Additionally, a user can type in a query (and a time range) to get stories relating to any query they might have along with their credibility / political bias.

                    <li>
                        News Balancer uses scikit learn to find similar articles based on a machine learning algorithm known as Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification. It was trained on a recently released dataset (News Data Aggregator, UCI 2016).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The biases and credibility of publications within this dataset were evaluated using well-known websites (ex. allsides.com).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Django application was built to visualize the biases in the studied articles, and also to extend it to new queries.

                <p>
                    Our group struggled both with inexperience in using machine learning packages, understanding a new dataset, and especially with development using Django. It is a miracle to us that we were able to piece this together in the amount of time we did.

                <h2>
                    What's next for News Balancer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    News Balancer would best work as an extension for news sites that people already go to. Thus News Balancer should take the form of a Chrome extension that could in real-time, check the credibility and bias of sources on news websites. This is especially important for sites such as Facebook that don't always fact-check sources.
