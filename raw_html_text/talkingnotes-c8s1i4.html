                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A passion for music and development led us to create this action on google.

                    Talking notes aims to guide the user from their current skill level and adapt a curriculum to their pace of training. Each session will guide the user through first tuning their instrument, then a set of scales to match the pieces to be included in any particular session, finishing with full scores suited to the user's skill level. Users can repeat scales and pieces as desired, with future iterations to include built in practice logs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Actions on Google Console, with Dialogflow and Firebase.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actions on Google has few resources available at this time which proved to be difficult, since we couldn't find solutions online for many of the issues we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created a project that we're passionate about, and that we think others can enjoy and benefit from. Before UofT Hacks, neither of us had any knowledge of Actions on Google and we believe we've brought this to a considerably functional point in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actions on Google is fairly new, so the development community is fairly small. We'd love to see it grow so that it is easier to develop!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TalkingNotes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to elaborate on this project. We'd of course like to add more lesson content, and also more information for the user about the progress they've made and the lessons they've completed.
