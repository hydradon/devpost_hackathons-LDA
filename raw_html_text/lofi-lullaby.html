                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our team's first hackathon and therefore, we started from scratch with no knowledge of how to do anything. Working with 3 strangers and learning each other's strengths provided an early challenge. Setting a realistic goal based our limited abilities and time frame. 30+ sleepless hours of tutorial videos and hair pulling later, we are  proud **cough** **cough** of our finished product! So in short, the whole thing was our hardest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together, we built an actual functioning game with a degree of difficulty to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build a simple 3D game in Unity, writing scripts in C# to control game interactions and functions, building a locally hosted website for the game using HTML, CSS and JS with a working sound component and menu!

                    Cleaning up the little things that didn't get finished. Things that come to mind:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hosting the game on a website that can be accessed worldwide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eliminating the possibility to spawn above terrain, thus ending the game prematurely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding a high score feature on the main menu.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to choose from multiple characters and backgrounds
                    </li>
