                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a society, Americans tend to over-spend online without knowing how much they're actually spending. We wanted to create something that would help give a psychological weight to prices to counteract impulse purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Chrome extension takes a price on a webpage such as Amazon and converts the price into an amount of time based on salary. To perform this, the extension takes in the user's salary per hour and uses that value to compute how much time an item is worth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if a user works for $15 per hour and chooses to buy a 12-pack of Soylent for $32 dollars, then the price would be represented as 2.13 hours. The purpose behind this extension is to help limit spending and to encourage consumer responsiblity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extension's interface uses a small icon next to the price to display the time-cost. This method is non-invasive and allows users to look at the cost quickly while still seeing the original cost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it using jQuery, the Chrome extensions API, and PicnicCSS.
                </p>

                        Form submission: you can't listen to the onclick of a button marked as a submit button in a form, rather you must listen to the submit of the entire form (we spent an hour debugging this)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Injecting css and js that wouldn't pollute the website's layout

                    <li>
                        A proper manner for easily identifying prices across e-commerce websites (we designed a regex expression)
