                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we fall back asleep immediately after hitting the snooze or shutoff button on our alarm clocks. We wanted to have some fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an alarm clock app on a phone but with a twist: instead of the phone going off, the car starts driving away and blasts loud music. The only way to shut it off is to get out of bed, chase after the car and press a button on it.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a Raspberry Pi as the nerve centre of a car kit.
