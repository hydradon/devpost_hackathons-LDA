                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea while we were ourselves competing in multiple CTF(Capture the flag) competitions. We decided that we wanted to try doing one ourselves. We started out knowing pretty little and ended up with a lot of new knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You register for an account and then you get access to the Puzzles, each puzzle is worth a certain amount of points(Those are kept secret to discourage rapid solving of all the hard ones). At any time you can check how your doing in the leaderboard!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While my teammate Steven, was focusing on creating the puzzles, I designed the front-end and back-end of the website. It has a fully working login and signup form, complete with a database to store login information, points and which puzzles you have solved. This was mostly done with MySQL and PHP. The Website design was done in CSS and HTML.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I knew pretty little about PHP and MySQL, I had to discover them on the way. It was challenging at first to understand and get everything set up, but eventually it became like second nature. In terms of the puzzle, Steven was limited in the time, but managed to get puzzles touching on the many bases of cyber-security, cryptology etc..

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, we started from the ground up and working together we implemented puzzles and code alike into one symbiotic program. It took a  lot of work but we managed to bring it to a high point.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Lexhak Capture The Flag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we hope to do next is up the amount and complexity of the puzzles. With our given time we could only integrate so many puzzles, but with more we believe that this can go a long way. With more dedicated hard work, we can achieve a fully working and very in-depth Capture the Flag Competition. We hope that in the future we will be able have a system where if a company wanted too, they could support us by being a sponsor.
