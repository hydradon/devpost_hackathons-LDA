                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From Here to There (FHTT) is an app that shows users their options for travel and allows them to make informed decisions about their form of transportation. The app shows statistics about different methods of transportation, including calories burned, CO2 emitted and estimated gas prices. See a route you like? Tap to open the route details in Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is written in Java using Android Studio. We are using the Google Maps Directions API to get most of our data. Other integrations include JSON simple and Firebase analytics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find ways to more positively influence users and have the app be more useful. The time pressure was both motivating and challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interaction with the Google Maps Directions API. The card based UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this project, we have gained more experience working with JSON and AsyncTasks. We know more about the merits and limitations of various Google APIs and have a bit more practice implementing Material Design guidelines. We also used git with Android Studio for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for From Here to There
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating a API for fuel cost updates. Improving the accuracy of calorie/gas/CO2 estimates by setting up Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database to collect user data such as height, weight and car type. Using a user system to show "lifetime" impact of trips.
