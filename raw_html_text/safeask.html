                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Immigrants are often afraid to seek legal advice due to the fear of outing themselves and the lack of proper communication due to language barriers. There is also a lot of misinformation and unfortunately, some people who wish to take advantage of the situation. We seek to solve that by allowing users to anonymously ask questions and receive answers in any language using Google Translate services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can anonymously view or ask questions in any selected language and immigration lawyers respond. Both users and lawyers can upvote a response that they feel is good. We do not collect any information on the users to preserve their anonymity and help maintain their sense of security while using the site. Lawyers do not have to publish their information, but we will collect their information to verify their credentials.

                    Using PostgresSQL and Sequelize on the backend and React on the frontend.
