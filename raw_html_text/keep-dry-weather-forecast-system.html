                    Inspiration: I do not usually check the weather forecast before going out and I often find myself being unprepared for bad weather. With the development of technology, it actually not so hard to make an accurate forecast of the weather. However, so many people who are just as lazy as me do not like to check the weather daily. As a result, there is nothing they can do. Unexpected weather such as rain and snow can get people sick.  I want to help solve this problem by introducing an application that can get people always updated when bad weather is coming so that can be more prepared.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I did research on possible solutions to help people during hazardous weather and came to realize that I can build an application to warm people whenever there is bad weather coming. I started brainstorming ideas on a paper and talked to experts from many companies to gather thoughts. The function is simple but took me a long time to get it to work. I did lots of debugging and troubleshooting during the process and finally made the application work as I planned.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: As a mechanical engineer, I did not have many experiences doing programming. This made it challenging for me to working on any projects. Also, my teammate and I had a different area of interest in this competition. Therefore, I quit and decided to work on my own project. Woking along got me stressful and I am so glad that I can finish it on time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  I talked to the IBM team and learned that a platform called Node-Red which is handy. I spent almost 20 hours learning all the fundamental functions and finally was able to use the platform to build the application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Javascript, Node-Red, AI (IBM Watson), IBM cloud, and persistence.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Keep Dry!" Weather Forecast System: I want to try to add some other functions to my app and allow users to customize the app. I want to add more AI technologies and machines learning to the application to make it smarter.
