                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team is a part of a high school vex robotics team, and we have found that the best way to be prepared to go into elimination rounds is to know that your alliance is statistically the best. However finding out which teams are the best on paper has proven to be very difficult as the current display of information is outdated or just hard to use. This has proven a costly time burden at tournaments which we hope to alleviate through the making of this app.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Query's data from a preexisting API, and displays it in an easy to use fashion as well as provides TRSP which provides a value to represent how hard a certain teams schedule is compared to others based on the CCWM. Also, provides easy to use interface as well as extra information for the elimination rounds.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift for all of the dev, specifically used Alamofire and SwiftyJson to make HTTP requests and parse JSON. We used the built-in Interactive builder in order to make all of our aesthetic factors.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The loose Swift type safety and lack of experience with JSON as well as populating tables with the parsed data provided a huge struggle. We also had a lot of trouble using git fluently which hindered us the most.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app works and we have been able to overcome all the challenges we have encountered using our intuition and stack exchange

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about swift and git as well as general ways to increase workflow efficiency while working as a team.

                    What's next for VexScouter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more stats with an ELO calculator (helps with world rankings) and expansion to provide support for the world level competition. Eventually, we would like to get a server to provide the data crunching capabilities required for ELO. We also wanted to add a notifications feature to send teams notifications of when their next match is.
