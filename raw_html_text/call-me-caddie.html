                    Call Me Caddie is a platform that brings together newcomers looking to move and cities that are seeking out these people. On our platform users will be provided with an eclectic selection of cities and opportunities catering to their needs. They can narrow down their search by selecting from a plethora of features and functionality that we will make available to them. We want them to have all the necessary tools to make an informed decision. Our goal is to match our users with their ideal homes. Cities, used as a catchall term for businesses, homeowners, employers, etc., will also be able to view user profiles and better assess what category of people they are attracting. Shrinking cities need capable professionals to take up jobs and help local businesses. Call Me Caddie creates this bridge between the city and the newcomers that had been missing so long. In interacting with our website we can keep the user engaged which is a crucial customer touch point for us. We are also introducing another option in which users can choose to go and explore the place themselves where a family will host them. In doing so our users will have a first hand experience of what it is like to live as a local. Call Me Caddie aims to make this transition, which can appear extremely taxing and daunting for many people, as seamless as possible and make both the cities on our website and our users better off.
