                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Countless times in the past when traveling to different areas, we have been caught by surprise when weather turned ugly without our realizing it. Now, however, we will never get caught in a downpour without an umbrella again! (hopefully).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes a given schedule (preferably from a platform like Google Calendar), and overlays the weather prediction for a given event's time and location, and notifies you about it via SMS text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Chrome extension built with JS and JQuery, and also made a Flask server with the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to make Chrome extensions, and dealing with CORS requests involving the OpenWeathers API. Additionally, parsing event information from the UI (We utilised Google Calendar in this case) proved to be a veritable challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to deal with our issue with CORS issues by tunneling with ngrok. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in regards to
                    <em>
                        learning
                    </em>
                    how to make Chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, particularly the concepts and practicality of various methods utilising APIs and Chrome Extensions. Additionally, we learned how to make a Flask server for the first time, and were very impressed by the results.
