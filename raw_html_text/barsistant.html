                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stuck in a bar waiting for the bartender to serve us, we were thinking why can't we make something to make this faster than waiting forever for someone to serve. Then we told our friends about our idea, and we got really good feedback on this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Barsistant is a fully integrated customer monitor system for the restaurant and bar industries. Employing customized electronics, we enable bartenders and servers to track the consumption and needs of their clientele. The product enables bartenders to anticipate customer orders, by algorithmically modeling consumption trends. The potential for business owners is a tremendous increase in volume of sales, and powerful data metrics about customer habits, employee performance and business statistics.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    Our algorithms classify the type of your drink and how much of it is remaining. Using an IoT (Internet-of-Things) enabled smart coaster it streams data wirelessly to the servers. The receiving application enables the server to determine the customer's needs including state of consumption, time since their order, and temperature of their drink. It will then advise the bartender on up selling drinks by pointing out who is in need of attending. 

Through an effective and simple phone app, Barsistant provides customers with the ability to pair directly with their smart coasters and both receive personalized drink recommendations and submit drink orders through an ordering platform integrated with the business&rsquo;s POS system. Barsistant has the potential to become the ubiquitous application for all restaurant and bars. Integrating seamlessly with the major POS systems it will use geolocation to identify the establishment you are visiting and immediately modify its theme, and menu based on the particular establishment. You will be able to go from one restaurant or bar to another browsing the menu, placing orders, and settling the bill, all from your personal device.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3D print the housing of our coaster. We custom assemble the electrical components using an arduino microcontroller and hand assembled it. We published this data on the website that we hosted using a LAMP stack. We wrote custom software algorithms to classify the drinks and publish this data over HTTP requests to our website.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been trying our hand at new technologies. Using the IoT (Internet of Things) for wireless connectivity on the software side, and arduino's open source microcontroller on the hardware side, we have faced poor documentation and a many technical obstacles. Thankfully our team has a myriad of technical and business backgrounds and together we have been able to rapidly get our idea from conception to protoyping.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that the implementation of our design ideas is not easy. That only through hard work and determination can we can overcome technical challenges to achieve our goal of bringing this product to market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Barsistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Barsistant needs to do extensive market research to identify what features customers are interseted in. Additionally we need to build a supply chain for our manufacturing process.
