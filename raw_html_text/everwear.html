                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a product for social good that was focused on fashion. After initially discussing outfit picking mechanisms and finding interest in using to computer vision to recognize clothing items, we decided to develop a website that would focus on finding ethically-sourced alternatives for clothing. Using our project, consumers can quickly find pieces they're interested in from a variety of sustainable fashion companies based on their preferences, which will hopefully make sustainable fashion more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users customize the website through our chatbot, which prompts them to upload images and answer questions about their preferences. Based on these preferences, the website will suggest a series of clothing items from sustainable fashion companies that might interest user, and links to buy them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our final product was built as a react website/app (along with it, we used Javascript, HTML, and CSS). The initial page's chatbot uses conversational-flow to facilitate prompts and responses. The backend uses Google Cloud custom search functions in order to find clothing items that are of interest to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clarifying an idea to focus on was a challenge - the topic is broad, and there are many different routes that we considered taking. Technically, trying to connect the backend and frontend while working on both was a challenge; we also ran into issues where the search was taking too long, with the requests sometimes timing out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make a mostly functional project! Even though we formed a team on Friday, we managed to develop an idea into a website that successfully addresses the problem we were aiming for (sustainable fashion).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was different for all of us; from React to Google Cloud services to conversational-flow, we all were challenged to work with and apply technologies we hadn't seen before.
