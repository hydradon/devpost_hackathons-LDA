                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    5 pivots later, a good group brainstorm leads to hype.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uber riders are now engaged in a game of
                    <strong>
                        Battleship!
                    </strong>
                    As they get rides around the city, their final destinations are geographically checked against premade 'battleships.' If they land in one, they are notified and challenged to find the rest. When you sink every battleship, you win a prize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app is where an Uber rider can sign up and authorize their final destination geolocation. This information is then sent to servers where the data is checked using node.js and stored with Parse. Parse sends push notifications to the user's mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Parse; using Uber APIs properly; sending information to a server; retrieving data from the server with JavaScript
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coming up with the idea! Delegating and accomplishing tasks as individuals in timely fashion.

                    How to use JavaScript to interact with a server; how to use Parse

                    We're going big, boys! Uber will buy us out and we'll scale the application for all cities
