                    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social communication and interaction, which affects 1 of every 68 people in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with autism suffer from social challenges and communication difficulties, which may prevent them from leading a fruitful and enjoyable life. It is imperative to diagnose and start treatments for autism as early as possible and, in order to do so, accurate methods of identifying the disorder are vital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This repository demonstrates our implementation of a statistical modal to classify Autism into 4 different subjects: low, medium, high, and ASD. The mentioned categories are classified based on severity of the Disorder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Data is from the National Database for Autism Research, and is not included in the repository since we are trying to respect the privacy of the over 190 subjects in our data. It mainly contains X and Y gaze values of where the subject was looking at in a screen for a timed duration.

                        We achieved classifying subjects with up to 96% accuracy using Random Forest. *
