                    At this point, not much, we just got it to connect to google api and display current location as well as directions between two waypoints.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used visual studio code and expo for development. It is written in react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never used react or expo before, so setting up the environment and learning how to do that in one day was very difficult.
                </p>
