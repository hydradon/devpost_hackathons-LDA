                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of gaming devices on the market targeted towards retro gamers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes open source emulators to play video games up to the PS1-era on a portable platform with built in controls, battery, 3.5" LCD display, etc. It also allows the user to play with other users on the network or over the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The enclosure and buttons were designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed, the buttons press switches under the enclosure that interface with the Raspberry Pi. The LCD screen is hooked up to the Pi with a composite cable. The software uses open source emulators to play retro games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The top half of the enclosure was printed incorrectly and had to be printed again (it takes 3.5 hours to print).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the Raspberry Pi to run most games made before the PS1 at full speed emulation. The project itself is fun to use as a standalone device, which was the goal of making from the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became much more competent in using the Raspberry Pi through programming the buttons and getting the emulators to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Tri
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polishing the final enclosure design and making the software more user friendly.
