                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We STARTED by building an iOS app that would recognize a Myo armband gesture between two users and initiate an https request to get two twitter users to follow eachother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, this app makes a shape over a troll face ripped off Google according to movement coming from the myo armband gyroscope
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I downloaded a Myo processing library (
                    <a href="https://github.com/nok/myo-processing" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/nok/myo-processing
                    </a>
                    ) from a github user, nok, and implemented code from my older art projects. Use of this app necessitates Myo Connect running in the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating this from scratch on the morning of the second day hours before the deadline. Not being able to go through with our original plan because it was too complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a music file that I produced, with volume amplitude feedback according to the 'shake' coming from the gyroscope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of Swift and Xcode during the first day, trying to build the iOS app.
                </p>

                    What's next for trollhack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding extra functionalities, making it able to run without Processing.
