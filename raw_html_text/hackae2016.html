                    We made a website where anyone can put in their address and find not only major federal elections, but more general elections that are happening locally. We figured that a lot of people never have a chance to vote in their local elections, and these can be some of the things that make the biggest impact on their lives! We used Google's public API for civic engagement which gave us our election information about locations and candidates.
