                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an efficient and simple way to construct well-designed layouts for users using plain English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes commands, such as "Draw a pink circle,&rdquo; and fabricates the associated shapes, icons, and even gifs accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A node.js server running the webpage takes input from the user and sends it to the Flask back end, which communicates with the Google Cloud ML NLP and wit.ai services to determine intents and entities for output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Google Cloud ML NLP to work was rather difficult at first, but then we supplemented it with wit and it became a breeze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had used Google Cloud Machine Learning services in Python before, so that was a fun learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a lot of insight regarding natural language processing and the integration of voice recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARTiculate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to implement more entities and intents for input to support different types of objects.
                </p>
