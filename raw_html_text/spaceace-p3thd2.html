                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured we could branch both the &ldquo;Entertainment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Education&rdquo; themes of this year&rsquo;s LA Hacks with a trivia game. Inspired by the recent developments with spaceflight (see: Elon Musk sending an entire car to Mars), we decided to go for space-themed questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpaceAce is a trivia game that educates the player about space. After the user attempts to answer each question, they are told whether they were correct; they are then prompted to learn more about the topic, or to move on to the next question. If the user decides to learn more, they will be redirected to the webpage of an article on the topic of the question. Once the user answers all the questions, they are greeted with a end screen and prompted to play again
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio. The majority of the program was written in Java; the UI was built with Android Studio&rsquo;s native UI editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our group had never programmed in Java before, so we had the hurdle of learning a new language. We also encountered various problems with GitHub, as we used Git Bash to manually perform version control instead of Android Studio&rsquo;s VCS, which was too confusing. As a result, we had to learn to deal with push/pull/merge conflicts, create and restore from backup branches, and manage the panic that comes from a working commit suddenly deciding to crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, and none of us had any app development experience. The fact that we were able to learn Android Studio/Java from scratch, and take an app from concept to final product all within this short time span, is something we&rsquo;re immensely proud of.
