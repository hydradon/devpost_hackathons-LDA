                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help architects to use existing technology to visualise how a physical space would be impacted by the inclusion of certain modifications they are interested in making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the Leica camera's 3D laser to measure distances around it in order to produce a 360 3D map of the world around it. In this world, the architect could add their own 3D models. With their smartphone's gyroscope and accelerometer, data such as speed and movement provides the user's position to achieve this through AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to communicate with the Leica camera, to control it and get output such as distance. We used Unity to implement the 3D world using the data from the camera. We can then import 3D models with unity to add to the world.
