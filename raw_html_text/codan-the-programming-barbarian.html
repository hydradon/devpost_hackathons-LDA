                    Codan the Programming Barbarian is a game that a few of us have wanted to make after John first came up with it. We made this game mostly for experience, none of us had much experience in game development, and Unity made our first experience fairly painless. While we faced many challenges, I couldn't imagine trying to learn a new language too. We all use C# in our classes, so C# being offered with Unity is a big bonus.

                    Codan is a WebGL game, which can easily be ported to a standalone app, Windows Store app, Mobile app, or anything else that Unity Supports. We attempted to host our project on our website domain we got from domains.com, but ran into many many issues. This was unfortunate, we were proud of the domain

                    . But we were focused on a web game and managed to use UCFilespace for the project.
