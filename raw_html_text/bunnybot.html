                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members has a VERY profound love of cats. Because of physics she does not have the time to take care of an actual pet cat. We thought that I'd be a good idea to bring a stuffed cat to life to keep her company during bouts of physics-induced stress. Unfortunately, Duane Reade does not have stuffed cats -- however, they did have a stuffed Easter bunny left over from their premium Easter collection (it was $3).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sings and purrs... like a bunny, because bunnies purr.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno, two touch sensors, one buzzer, and one LCD backlight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use an Intel Edison to pull data from the internet, however we had a very hard time setting up the Intel development environment. Apparently, the LCD backlight has a switch that dictates whether or not text can be displayed in addition to a backlight. We discovered this by accident after five hours of HARDCORE CODE ANALYSIS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to code simple songs using the buzzer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hardware can be very unpredictable and frustrating. Rather than dwelling on the problem, we chose to find alternatives and try other options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bunnybot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we could get Intel Edison to work with Twilio, we would like to make the Bunnybot a gift for a loved one. We want for the Bunnybot to display short text messages from a specific number(s).
