                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Jackbox party game. Rather than playing through a webpage we instead use a mobile phone call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players dial a number and connect to the game. They are asked for their name and then wait for all players to ready up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game then starts, one by one a snippet of a song is played and the player asked who they think the artist is ("who dat?!"). Using speech recognition the answer is parsed to text and checked against the real answer (unimplemented due to challenges below).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scores would then be calculated and one lucky caller crowned a winner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main component of the hack is the Nexmo API, we used the Node.js Nexmo library. We provide endpoints to Nexmo through an express server (as well as serving the music files) allowing us to dynamically change the NCCO objects required to structure the call as the game progresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was unable to install the Google Speech Node.js library on either my local machine or a Google Cloud VM instance. Because of this there is no speech recognition, so no leaderboard (we planned to parse the player name to assign to the phone numbers) and no way of checking the player scores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The flow of the game works well, transfering into a new NCCO when the game state changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Who Dat?!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add speech recognition so all functionality can be realised. 
Make the game more robust with multiple players (there was not much chance to test with multiple phones).
                </p>
