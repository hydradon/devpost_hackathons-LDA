                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of mental health has grown exponentially, and it correlates to more cases of depression in youth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes brain waves and will determine if the user is stressed or calm, and based on the result, it will give the user a biofeedback through different light patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Muse Headband to read the brain waves, and an Arduino to control the light biofeedback.  This was developed with Arduino and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time getting the light biofeedback to cooperate with our computers.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with such a useful idea, The first time we streamed data from the headset to our program using the Muse SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How the brain works and how its frequencies are related to the emotions.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the analyzing and the feedback systems seamless through a server.
