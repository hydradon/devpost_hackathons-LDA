                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that lets you know who is around you, especially in the office. It's very easy to remember someone's face but forget their name. PetPebble, your personal pet rock, is going to help you connect with new acquaintances and friends you already met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A pebble sits on your watch and will notify you of the names and statuses of other app owners around you. When you approach someone else with a Pebble, your close proximity will query for that other person's data and display it on your wrist, and vice versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Pebble.js in the CloudPebble IDE and also used Firebase's server and static webpage hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always challenging to work with and integrate new tech; we had not used Pebble or Firebase before. We didn't have much experience in Javascript and working with web backends. The mentors were very supportive and helped us troubleshoot issues and finding documents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make our pet pebble come to life, and interact with others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build Pebble apps in the cloud and implement a quick, effective backend for our app using Firebase.
