                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a basic tool to identify different classes of emotions in emails, primarily happiness, anger, sadness, irritation, and appreciation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool was developed in Python, and it uses a hash table stored with words associated with each emotion class to match words and phrases from the email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sarcasm is hard to detect using this approach, as the tool only reads literal values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We won!

                <p>
                    We would love to extend this tool, as we think it has many benefits. In the future, we'd love to enhance it so the input format doesn't have to be so rigid and extend it to include other possible emotions. Additionally, this tool was a lot of fun to create and test on our own personal emails!
