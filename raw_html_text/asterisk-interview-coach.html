                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that interviews can often be difficult to improve in, especially in those who are relatively new to them. So, we sought to create a program that can objectively help people with their interview skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user uploads a video to our web page, and will receive almost instant feedback on their interview skills. The main metrics measured are: eye contact, emotion, and sentiment in content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the front-end, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the back-end, we used Python and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Flask for the first time was difficult and had a bit of a learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to accomplish our goal of making interview coaching more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing we learned was how to properly connect front-end and back-end to make a fully integrated application.

                    We want to improve the results by including Machine Learning, as well as adding more metrics to make it even more informative.
