                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started here at Hack The North itself when sitting in the opening ceremony listening to  Jack Dorsey speaking about the importance of  health in this world and how  blockchain can help in  solving  the existing problems within the health industry,Over 100,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an organ transplant.Unfortunately, many may never get the call saying that a suitable donor organ &mdash; and a second chance at life &mdash; has been found. It's estimated that every day in the U.S. 20 patients die because of the lack of donor organs.Every ten minutes another person is added to the waiting list  . 
So, we came up with a solution, DonerChain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DonerChain provides a secure,scalable  platform for people to help donate and receive  blood/organs by having a fully trustable blockchain solution supported by Algorand to help them maintain trust and transparency during the procedure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it using algorand pure proof of stake protocol, firebase and react and with our amazing team here at DonerChain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connection between react and algorand was a challenge at the beginning , we also had to figure out exactly what we want to store on network to make transactions fast and efficient while maintaining trust of the user also searching up algorand network (blockchain) and displaying availability on google maps while maintaining full transparency was a big challenge for us.
