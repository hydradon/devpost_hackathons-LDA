                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students at Hopkins often wonder if they should add a certain major or minor, but are concerned if it will be too many extra courses or not. This will help them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Hopkins student enters the courses they've taken so far, and it will give me the top three minors that they can get without having to take too many more courses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend and logic is built in python. We use tkinter for the gui. JHU courses are pulled in using the SIS API.

                    As CS majors, it'd be easy for us to all get CS minors!
