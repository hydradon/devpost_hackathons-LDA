                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traveling can be tedious and confusing at times. So, having an app on your phone that has all the steps of your trip would making travel easier.

                    It provides a QR code to scan when checking into the airport, checking into a hotel room, and parking.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Google Slide that displays each step of using Travel Smart and describes the use of each page.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the pages on the phone icon got to crowded so we had to find ways to split up the images and descriptions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We were able to find some problems with our recent travel plans and find ways to improve them.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to split work up so that we could complete it faster.
