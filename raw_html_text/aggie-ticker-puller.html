                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a huge football fan, I hated getting early in the morning just pull tickets, so I thought of an online system for pulling tickets for football games. I believe getting valuable sleep is more important than waking up at 5AM to get good seating for football games.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an online form that allows you to pull tickets for local a&amp;m games. It has an interactive map of the stadium to select the section you want.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML and CSS. We coding the backend using Javascript since we were not able to get a python solution to work in the time allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues creating a back-end for the program. Instead of using Django, we settled on using javascript for the backend. We were going to use Django to handle user data and authentication with Google. With a bit more time, we could've probably managed to get it to work, but alas, we had to use Javascript for time sakes. Another challenge was creating an interactive map to select sections. Getting the weird shapes for the buttons was tough, and getting them to stay in place with the map was tougher.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are accomplished by how the website ended up looking. We managed to get most of the CSS just how we wanted to create a clean UI for the user.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the hardships when it comes to creating a server that can run a website. It takes a lot of effort to build a program. It gives us a better idea of what a software engineer does in a real-world setting.
