                    An interesting phenomenon is that people generally enjoy listening to music with similar BPMs to the BPM of the average human heartbeat. We have decided to explore this phenomenon with our new project, Hear Your Heart. We believe the music will empower people to work out better and more efficiently.

                <p>
                    We used the FitBit API in order to fetch the heart rate values read in from the watch, and matched the BPM with similar BPMs from well-known songs. This creates an interesting workout experience that encourages people to keep their heart rate up.

                    Note: we had to remove the songs from the project files because they took up too much space
