                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Caravan-style road trips are logistical nightmares. Someone has to use the restroom? They have to call every car in the party just to let everyone know. Someone falls behind the group? Good luck finding them within the next hour. We wanted to create an easy, intuitive way to make road trips a painless experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group leader makes a trip.
The group members join the trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you're in, your location data is shared on a group map for everyone to see.
