                    We wanted to create a strategic game that would be both fun to play and interesting to create. In the game, the player strategically places towers to defend against enemies that try to get to the end of the map. We built the game using Java and the StdDraw library. We ran into several problems, such as time constraints and other problems. One problem that we faced was that it was hard to sync work up between our team, which we solved by sharing files on google drive. We are very proud of our work, since it runs smoothly without hiccups and is playable. We learned many things about working as a team and distributing work properly, something that both of the members of our team have not really done before. We are very proud of our work, and we hope that it reflects the effort that we put into it.
