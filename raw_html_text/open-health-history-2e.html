                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many people go to free clinics or healthcare providers that do not keep their records clean and up-to-date. This presents challenges to Emergency Medical Technicians, Emergency Room Technicians and physicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide a system to low/no income individuals to have a place to keep their medical records with little cost to the government or public and with a drastic reduction of lost or incorrect records.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DASH stores relevant medical information and medical histories of the users willing to participate in the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the address of the user is accessed, the user is asked for authenticating information to verify the identity of the person who is accessing the medical records. There is an additional authentication method for emergency service providers and medical staff with permission to access these records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Documents are only able to be updated or deleted by authorized medical providers for the safety of the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DASH is a combination between a react javascript application and an express js RESTful api that uses mongoDB as its primary storage. We architected a user data model for our application along with a hospital visits records data model for storing information about users such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Personal:
                    </strong>
                    Name, Date of Birth, Blood Type, Allergies, Etc.
                    <strong>
                        Visit Records:
                    </strong>
                    Type of Visit, Doctor Name/ID, Location of Visit, Diagnosis, Symptoms Reported During Visit, Etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used python scripting to generate over 500 health records for over 100 users with varying levels of information to simulate inaccuracies in the real world of data collection and stored them in a mongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was deploying to Heroku. Originally, we had planned to connect Travis-CI, a way to continuously build and integrate our project. This work needed to be done at the beginning of the project and due to a bug we were unable to get it to deploy correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to fully build a RESTful API with a front end that queries the backend, all from scratch during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the difficulties of bug searching in initial stages for continuous integration frameworks like Travis-CI.
Along with that, we were able to learn new frameworks for QR code scanning, and QR code generation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Health History ( 2E )
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next integration idea is to integrate DASH with blockchain technology to be able to hold records publicly in ledgers and accessible privately in a similar way that wallets work with finances.
