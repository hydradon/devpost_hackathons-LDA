                    Why
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends and I have trouble choosing where we want to eat. This app will make the decision easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app asks how many people are voting. It then prompts each person to enter where they would like to eat. After everyone has entered, the program chooses which place got the most votes. If there is a tie it chooses a random one. It then displays a URL that the user can enter into their web browser which will give them directions to the nearest restaurant with that name.
