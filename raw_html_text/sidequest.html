                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working in a large company can sometimes become very difficult, because of distributed information which is not always documented or easy accessible. You often have to make several phone calls or write several emails to find persons (units) which have the information you are looking for. This takes time and can be very annoying process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SideQuests routes questions within the company until they get answered. Therefore a questions is send to different units where any user assigned can redirect to other units or answer the question. By logging the routes a network graph is created which shows the single hops and helps companies to identify bottlenecks within their information chains.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MEAN Stack in order to develop a working prototype quickly.
We set it up on a existing project from the sebis chair, whicht was brought to the students within
the SEBA Master Lab course.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an old laptop with modern web technology doesn't work that well.
Angular (1) leads to spaghetti code in some cases.
Doing safe copies with mongoose by adding some data to existing data within a put request.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitching or presenting in front of 300 people is easy as presenting in front of 30 people :-)
