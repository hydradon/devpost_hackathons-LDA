                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have trouble approaching others about forming teams, so I figured other people might too. By being able to talk to other hackers, we can form teams and possibly friends more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chat server that also allows you to show general information about yourself, and see information about others that is related to hacking. Users sign in with either Twitter, Google, Facebook, or GitHub. It also tests your compatibility with other hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Atom with Firebase, Bootstrap, and various APIs to form the chat function and profiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never developed a dynamic website before, especially not one with a chat function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I got so much done and I learned a lot of information that can use later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to develop a dynamic websites with multiple different, complicated functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacka-Chat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more information to the profiles and allow for private messaging between hackers.
