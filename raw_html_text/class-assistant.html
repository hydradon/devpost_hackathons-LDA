                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that the greatest impediment to trying to learn something new is that a lot of times, not all that you need to know is compiled in one place. We sought to make a platform that people can obtain knowledge about college-related classes all in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made Class Assistant. Idealistically, it will be a cross-platform web app, but for now, it is only supported as a website. Class Assistant is a tool that helps college professors and school teachers select high-quality content from a database of a variety of topics to help guide students in the right way without having the students rely on outside content which can lead to a divide in understanding of the topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Class Assistant using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used the Bootstrap framework to implement many of the features that we built into the website like the sidebar, navbar, and various pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many design-related problems during the middle part of the hacking part of the hackathon. We both had different ideas on what the design should be and butted heads a few times. We overcame these by giving in to each other and coming to a solution that we both could accept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we created a functional skeleton of a website. Although many features are still missing compared to the envisioned product, we are proud because we
                    <strong>
                        made
                    </strong>
                    a product over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working in a team requires sacrifice and concession to succeed. In a time-constrained environment, we had to work hard over a long period in order to finish our product on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Class Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to refine the UI and UX and implement a database of useful, relevant, and modern videos that will serve to help anyone who wants to learn something new.
