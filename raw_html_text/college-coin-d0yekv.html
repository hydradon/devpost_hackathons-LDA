                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transition into college can be difficult for many as they have to become independent; with this independence, comes a great deal of responsibility. Our inspiration was to ease this process for individuals through a system in which college students can help other college students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application first takes in the user's information based off of their ".edu" email. After this has been completed, the user is given the option to either provide a service or request a service. However, what is unique about this application is that these services are both requested and provided by college students. If the individual completes a service for someone else "college coins" are given and if a service is completed for them "college coins" are taken away. This concept parallels the idea of a cryptocurrency.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help design this program we used Django and Bootstrap. The project was divided into the front end and the back end. Bootstrap was used to design the graphics and layout of the website while Django was used for the coding to add functionality to the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant challenge that we faced through this process was finalizing our project. After spending close to two hours mapping out and coding our first project we discovered a similar application existed. We then moved forward to a new idea where we encountered complications in the compatibility of firebase and native script for an app. Finally, we spoke to the representatives from Google and decided to use Bootstrap to create a website that was also compatible with mobile devices. Once the components of the website were put together, we faced trouble in hosting the site.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As 3 out of the 4 members in this group were participating in a hackathon for the first time, we are very proud of being able to have an end product. Furthermore, learning the different applications and seeing them come together effectively was big achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this hackathon, we learned how to use Html configuration for design. Furthermore, we learned how to use different tools in firebase such as the authentication system and cloud firestore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Coin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to continue building upon this website and improve the design of the website. Furthermore, we are hoping to add more functionality to the currency itself so we can expand this idea across different colleges.
