                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The number of cases of abductions, disappearances and abuses that have been happening lately has made me value a tool like this to try to help these people to get out of these situations.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile app that warns your friends and family if you get far of your way without warn. It will include a pannic button too and more functionalities.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Ionic 2 and Google Maps APIs.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started doing a project with another teammate, but the circumstances did that I leave the project and start anotherone with less hours left. I had never worked with Ionic, Angular, and Google APIs, so I got in a lot of problems while developing the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got a semi finished hybrid app developed with Ionic, and I learnt to develope with Angular 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Ionic 2, Angular 2, Google Maps APIs

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will add a panic button, different ways to warn different people about the movements far of the way and a better design and user experience, including saved preferences.
