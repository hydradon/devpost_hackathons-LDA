                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning with others is crucial to the college experience, but it's not always easy to connect with other students in a lecture hall with over 200 people. We wanted to make a platform for to students find others in their classes to form study groups and share resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyMatch provides chat rooms for each class on campus where students can communicate with each other about the class and organize study events. This version has chatrooms only available for certain computer science classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a website through html and css, with the chatrooms developed in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were overambitious and overestimated our abilities to develop a functional chatroom/website, in languages we didn't know, in 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something! This was our first Hackathon and our first real project outside of class. It has some functionality and could be a cool project if we decided to develop it further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new tools in html/css and JavaScript. We learned how to make servers and how JavaScript interacts with localhost. We also learned valuable tools when it comes to project management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyMatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we decided to develop this further, we would flesh out the project more and complete the functionality (accounts, logins, etc) so that the student population could actually use this website.
                </p>
