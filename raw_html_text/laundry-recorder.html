                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our school, we have a common dorm laundry. However, we usually struggle with people who don't pick up their laundries on  time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It records availability of laundries and how many times left for laundry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built by using android-studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We try to make timer and to show availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can record availability and time. Also, we have really cool navigation bar on the bottom of the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time to use android-studio. We learned a lot about how to make application with android-studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for Laundry Recorder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fix an error of changing screens. Also, we need to add various times to select such as 45 mins and 25 mins.
