                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to sight read sheet music is hard, yet games like guitar hero express complicated rhythms in an easy-to-process manner just by using the note spacings. We figured there had to be a way this could be applied to real music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you enter sheet music, the app will play it on a track at the speed of your choice and detect how well you play it by listening on a microphone.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used libgdx and a Java DSP library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DSP in Java is hard :( and musical notation can be complex
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to solve the issue of I/O lag by giving feedback visual following phrases of notes instead of in real-time
                </p>
