                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we stepped into the Bentley, we realised it had features we didn't even know we wanted. With things like inbuilt massagers, customised lighting, warmed seats etc. we felt like this car had more features than we could imagine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me of 'Kit' from knight rider slightly. But what made 'Kit', the crime-fighting car from the tv show, really special was that it felt alive. It understood its environment, and more importantly understood its driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to create some features to help bring this to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors the weather. If it gets a bit chilly outside, it'll keep the car warm for when you get in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But let's say you want to set the temperature manually, you can. It has integration with google home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let's say you have a camera built into your Bentley and you've had a rough day. We've used emotional recognition to understand the driver and turn the masseuse on accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a neural net pre-trained for recognising emotions and altered it slightly to send emotions to an API. 
We also integrated APIs to allow access to the weather and created 'skills' for Google home integration.
We then created a frontend to allow us to display all this information clearly and concisely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult finding an accurate neural net and making sure everything works well together. We also had some problems with the WiFi, which set us back a bit!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it's a truly genuine idea, which is what makes it amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about neural networks, and also tried some reinforcement learning (which was much more difficult than we had anticipated).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ben for Bentley
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can showcase this idea to Bentley in more detail, and brainstorm even more features that we could use to make the EXP 100 GT even smarter.
                </p>
