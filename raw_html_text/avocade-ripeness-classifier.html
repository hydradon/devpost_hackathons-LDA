                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create something I have recently learnt from the Fast.ai course. Implement it to help make life easier for myself and
                    <em>
                        maybe
                    </em>
                    others. Seemingly easy(was not) and quick(way not)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in images of avocados. It is a resnet32 CNN thats trained on images picked by hand into the three classes. Once the model was trained on a set of just 55 images, it has returned an accuracy of 85%.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the fast.ai library that is built on top of pytorch. It makes life easier since it has pre-trained model weights for a resnet32 CNN. Also using a Gcloud instance makes for fast processing.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Image data set. Avocados have various infographics on image google searches. But to download images of skins of avocados to represent the various classes soon proved that there have been many duplicates/ artificial photos.

                    Getting a decent accuracy on a small data set.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aim was sky high. We wanted to build a website and an api so that we could use our model in day to day applications.
