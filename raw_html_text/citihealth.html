                    It's an app built in react-native; it connects to your Citi bank account and displays your current balance, health and recent transactions. The purpose of the app is to help ease your life and have someone help you spend and save money better. It integrates with the google assistant, so if you own a google assistant or just have the app on your phone, that app enables a simpler, hands free way to manage your spending.

                    We always remembered to never give up, and have fun.
