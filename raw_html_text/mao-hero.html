                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growning up as a kid, I loved guitar hero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Myo hero is a guitar hero type game, however instead of strumming notes on a guitar, you will be performing hand gestures as the various inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Myo SDK along with Xcode to develop this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some testing I learned that the Myo is
                    <strong>
                        horribly inaccurate
                    </strong>
                    . This presented a huge challenge for me as detecting these gestures in an accurate and timely manner is essential for this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to learn and use the Myo SDK, and l also got to learn a bit about the Muse SDK as well, however I was unable to use it as all of the Muses were already being used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about integrating hardware in my apps, more specifically the Myo and Muse; I learned how to use and manage hardware in an effort to make more immersive and connected user experiences.
