                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one likes waiting in lines, and at an event like a career fair lines can mean losing precious opportunities. By using this app you can be in multiple lines at once and can maximize the lines that you get to the end of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create a line and others can choose to join it and take a number. As the creator of the list I can call the next person when it's their turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also join lines, and it will appear in their joined lines. When the current number of the line matches the number they were given, the user will get an alert message to indicate that it's their turn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to write the app, and the Cloud Firestore database system that is a part of Google Firebase. When a line is created, and/or when someone joins it, this information is added to the online database so that is accessible to all other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with firebase was difficult to figure out, especially how to read data from our database. The next main challenge was being able to identify and separate what lines a user has joined and which they haven't.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <strong>
                        It works!
                    </strong>
                    Before the deadline! We're proud of successfully designing and using a database, even though none of us had any experience with it.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about maintaining and using a database, and using Android Studio. We also learned that Android Studio loves swallowing our RAM.
                </p>

                    What's next for Line Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the UI and making it more user friendly. Right now the app is functional but it doesn't look great, so that's what we're working on next.
