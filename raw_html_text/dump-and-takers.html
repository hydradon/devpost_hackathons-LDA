                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team member ran into problems throwing things out. Most of the time these things were perfectly fine but he didn't have space to put it. He felt bad for throwing away perfectly good things. So we came up with a platform which allows you to throw your stuff and others who are interested to collect it. UI inspiration from Tinder and Uber!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dumpers drop their item along with their description, name, picture, date and time at a location. This location is put onto the database and Takers who are in the geographical area can view these items. The Takers receive the coordinates and must track down the items. If they are within the physical vicinity then they can claim the item dump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a universal windows application which interfaced with a local SQLlite database to send and receive item data. We used native location data and google maps api to get location.
                </p>
                <h2>
