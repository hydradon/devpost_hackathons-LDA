                    Inspiration - After attempting to complete a series of other projects and failing miserably, I decided to  conduct some research on IoT devices to create something relatively innovative.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - My project is essentially a device that allows users to control their devices from any where around the world while using a simple micro controller with an ESP8266 module .
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - After conducting research on different IoT applications and tutorials, I built my project with the Arduino programming IDE to give commands to the micro controller with an Arduino ESP8266 module. After completing the hardware side of the project, I then created a website to control a servo motor over the internet.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - A few challenges that I ran into were: power, deploying the website, setting up the connection between the Arduino and the web server.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - I am proud to have learned about the many different IoT platforms and devices that are out there.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - There are many use cases towards developing IoT applications. Attending HackUMass allowed me to realize  what developers face in developing IoT platforms. Most of all, I learned that though there maybe many applications towards IoT, there is always room to improve and innovate in this area.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ESP8266 Servo Control - Create a method to communicate with the micro controller with Amazon Alexa.
