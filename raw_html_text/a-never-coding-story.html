                    Writers block is a never ending challenge when it comes to student projects and professional life. So, we decide to write code to help users discover interesting plot lines, make writing easier and more fun.

                <h2>
                    We built it by generating over 20 random variables out of millions of possibilities. Then using key words variable weights, we generated a short story for the user to expand upon.

                <h2>
                    We ran into challenges generating algorithms that were complex enough to generate a flowing story. We also, ran into the challenge of the English language and making the sentence structure understandable.

                <h2>
                    We are proud of persevering through the challenges and creating something that can potentially help others. We also are proud of overcoming the issues visual studio 17 has with many of the library's we used.

                <h2>
                    We learned more about group related coding and how fast a "simple idea" can grow and become vary difficult.

                    A Never Coding Story will hopefully develop a better user interface with more possible plot line. Meaning the backend algorithms will become more advance while the frontend will become eas
