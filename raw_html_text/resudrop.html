                    Recruitment made easy.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fall is an incredibly busy time for recruiters, as students begin looking for summer internship and full-time placements alike. At career fairs and recruiting events, recruiters have hundreds of conversations, business cards, and paper resumes, scattered and separate. The sheer volume of applicants means that recruiters can't remember faces to names, and names to resumes, making the aftermath of a recruiting event a sticky situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How do we fix this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend, we built Resudrop, a website and android application that solves this inconvenience. Resudrop enables applicants to upload their resume online and then access a corresponding QR code on their mobile devices to shows recruiters. Recruiters can then scan the code and access the document on their own devices, adding their ratings and thoughts, and maintain an organized repository of all the collected resumes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app with a Parse back-end. Website is hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the programmers had prior experience with building on android before. As such, learning how to get started and navigating through the intricacies behind android development were arguably one of the greatest challenges faced in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for three members of our team. Having no prior experience in app development, this was a huge milestone that we can all be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never dealt with android development before hand, our biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to build an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resudrop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we move forward, we would like to enhance the UI and add features that will improve the user experience, such as more editing options on the PDF files so that recruiters won't forget what their impression of an applicant was.
