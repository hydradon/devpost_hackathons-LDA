                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make a short quick game that actually tests knowledge and is not based on a single skill based game mechanic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tests users knowledge about historical figures and leaves them with extra knowledge of the wider world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Java in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges along the way, these included not being able to do an if statement and not having buttons do anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we finished the app in time, and in its current state. Despite not knowing any java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to program android apps using java with Android Studio.

                    What's next for Quote Guesser App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More rounds of quotes, with increased levels of difficulty. The GUI will be improved.
