                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By connecting few Arduino modules as well as sensors and peripheral devices. Heart of the system is responsible for gathering and displaying all informations from other Arduino modules while they collect data form sensors.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Huge amount of subsystems and each of them we had to tackle separately.(LCD and sensors). 
4 different communication protocols 
lack of internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created working prototype of the system with many on-board devices. We got GPS module to track user position, thermometer and heartbeat meter to monitor most important vital signs. Accelerometer to check for any crashes.
LCD screen which let us display all these features in user-friendly way. 
At the end we are very satisfied of final outcome of our work!
