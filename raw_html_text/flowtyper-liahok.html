                    As high school students ourselves, we understand the amount of pressure there is to write a full-bodied essay, so we created Flowtyper. Every teenager who is about to write a 3-4 page essay does not like to see ominous blank pages ahead of them. All that empty space can seem very intimidating. Writers, who need to write all the time and struggle with getting past writer's block, will love Flowtyper because it makes it effortless to literally write your first page in seconds. Flowtyper would fix the horrors of a blank-page-depression. It is an online brainstorming utility that enables people to brainstorm &mdash; fast. Prioritizing inspiration and creativity over quality and perfection. It is the ideal tool for those with short attention spans (basically the entire millennial generation). Our website eliminates all the fears that come to mind when we see an difficult writing assignment ahead of us. Everything that one types will fill the entire screen and as more and more words are typed you don&rsquo;t get the sense like you are striving to meet a quota. Once you have finished typing all your ideas, they can be viewed and submitted to a personal journal. In the future we hope to add an account feature to our website to make it more personal for the users. 
What&rsquo;s truly innovative about our web tool is it&rsquo;s ability to bypass the anxiety and stress associated with feeling overwhelmed by assignments and really give you a head start on your writing process.
