                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAFE is designed to help users save their money. I was inspired by an application that exists already called Forest- an app that forces users off their phones to help them focus what they need to do (i.e. study).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAFE links the savings account and the user sets a goal whether for how much they want to add to their savings whether that goal may be daily, weekly, monthly etc. It all depends on the users preference. And each dollar amount they save accumulates to virtual furniture. They must keep gaining furniture to complete a "home" in which they not only achieved saving their goal amount- but they earn reward points for each time they save in which they can redeem as gift cards. If users remove money, as an incentive to discourage immediate spending and encourage saving first and then spending- SAFE charges the user 3 percent of their goal. SAFE also donates furniture for those affected by natural disasters each time a user reaches their goal and builds a virtual home. SAFE also offers their services to other business to encourage 3D visualizations of their products. If users tend save for their "virtual products" and earn rewards points that can be spent at their business. There is also a template that exists for Wayfair for demand management.
