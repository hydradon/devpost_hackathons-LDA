                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Banks and IoT are both being used more frequently. Our program gives you the ability to check your capital one transactions from your Google home device. It would also be able to set budgets for the month and notify you once you went over, as well as send money between other capital one accounts.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilised the Google cloud API as well as the capital one API to give us the required account information. The cloud API meant we could perform speech to text and vice versa more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice to text is hard and pyaudio can be tricky to implement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is something that genuinely is not in the market, and showed a proof of concept we would like to develop upon
