                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a variance of Minimax called Negamax, along with Alpha Beta pruning and a few other optimizations. Read more on

                    Figuring out how to optimize the algorithm.

                <p>
                    It works, and I have yet to beat it!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence is not as hard as I thought! (Well, it probably still is, but you can do really cool things with some basic artificial intelligence concepts.)

                    What's next for Chess Artificial Intelligence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More optimizations, and also probably some testing because I didn't get around to that either.
