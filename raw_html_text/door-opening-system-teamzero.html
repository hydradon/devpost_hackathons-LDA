                    The Garage Door Opening System allows you to control your garage door remotely. You can open it via Web Browser from your Computer or your Smartphone from all over the world. The intelligence in this system is the automatic licence recognition of your own cars that you can register in the system. If an unregistered car is in front of the garage door, the system will detect it and will show a red light (alarm). Otherwise a green light is turned on and the garage door opens.
                </p>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A garage door opening system with an automatic built-in licence recognition helps people to park faster in the garage. The door opens and closes automatically so that you don't have to think about it. Two lights show you whether the car was recognized correctly or not.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Raspberry Pi together with an Arduino that controls the step motor for the garage door. The Web Application that we have create is hosted by Microsoft Azure and can be accessed from all over the word. A licence recognition system was implemented in Java that uses the OpenCV library. We use a self made car and garage door for simulation of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was the planning of the project and dividing of work. We discussed a lot and created an architecture and some notes about the Garage Door Opening System. The next challenge was the installation of the operating system (Rasbian) and the creating of the internet connection. The licence plate recognition works only if the contrast is high enough and the the licence plate has the right distance from the camera. In the end we had some problems with connecting some LEDs to the system. Finally we have managed all challenges and created an innovative project.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned to work together and manage challenges. It was a great experience to work with team member from different countries and to communicate in English. Furthermore we learned to work hard to achieve a good result and to finish the project until the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to use this project as a prototype and adapt it to a real life project. In a real Garage Door Opening System we will use a webcam for the licence number recognition and a real Motor for opening the garage door.
