                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a device that was both practical and beginner friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By monitoring motion, sound and light, this alarm system will notify you when an unwelcomed intruder comes to your front door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attached a Grove base shield, LCD screen, vibration sensor, light sensor, and a sound sensor to an Arduino Uno.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the build, we were originally planning to use a digital 3 axis accelerometer, but we were unable to use the device because we were unfamiliar with how to code for the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time hackers, we have little knowledge of any of the hardware provided. Despite that fact, we were able to design a functional device in a very short time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the Arduino IDE is very similar in syntax as C++. We have also learned that the Arduino Uno is a very versatile device because of the way it can power a variety of projects with very little limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JustLock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this device with learning in mind. So we are looking towards improving on this project while expanding our knowledge in hardware hacking and design.
