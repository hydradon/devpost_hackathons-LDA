                    Many new programmers have used Scratch or similar coding tools. However, they're not quite interactive. You string together a slew of blocks, and a computer mysteriously produces an animation on your screen &ndash; or not, if you've got a bug!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With CodingIRL,
                    <em>
                        you
                    </em>
                    get to be the computer. Given a puzzle on screen, you have to string together commands to solve it &ndash; then
                    <em>
                        you
                    </em>
                    get to execute it. Powered by the Oculus Rift, you appear in a virtual reality world where, voice guided by your techniques, you get to find your way to the puzzle's solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you mess up the solution, no worries! Back to the drawing board before you hop back in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach introduces new programmers, especially kids, to important algorithmic and problem solving techniques.
