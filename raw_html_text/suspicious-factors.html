                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cool dudes at Finra dressed up as superheroes. Thinking about how to design and manage such large sets of data was also something the team wanted to do.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining who's potentially part of the financial "bad guys" using a given dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsed a large amount of data with Python, storing it into a MongoDB database. This data was also parsed in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Wi-Fi was spotty so it was difficult to properly set up our environment. Additionally, since the dataset was so large it took a substantial amount of time to process, which made testing somewhat difficult. Finally, trying to decide what data was relevant to our model was not very easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we got to learn about parsing and dealing with large datasets and building an efficient graph using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Python, and that we can drink a lot of RedBull.
