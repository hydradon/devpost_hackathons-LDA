                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hospital inaccessibility for the rural masses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doctor Who helps the rural masses book an appointment at a nearby hospital with the doctor of their choice. The user calls a toll-free number and an IVR is activated. They're taken through a bunch of choices, which results in a booking of an appointment. The user will get a confirmation SMS. The doctor will be able to check the appointments on a dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of the rural masses do not have access to internet, or unfamiliar with it's usage. This application does not require an internet connection. In a rural setup, hospitals might not have a helpline. This application helps the users make an appointment without any prior knowledge about the hospital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're using KooKoo as the IVR platform. The application logic is written using PHP. The dashboard is built in Angular. KooKoo integrates with PHP for driving the IVR logic. PHP integrates with Way2SMS to send SMS to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time figuring what to hack. But hey, we did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got familiarized with stacks like KooKoo and Way2sms. We targeted the social domain, in the hopes of having a large impact on the rural masses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to a concensus on the hack idea quickly (less than 6 hours) is pretty much the most important thing in a 24-hour hackathon. Half your hack is done when you have a clear picture on what needs to be done.
