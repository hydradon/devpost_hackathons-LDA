                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everyone in our group had an elderly family member that had trouble remembering to take their pills. We noticed that every app on the market, while robust, were too complicated for our elderly family. We wanted to make something extremely simple and straightforward that everyone could use, regardless of financial literacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app helps users track the medications they have left to take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group and I used AdobeXD to prototype, Adobe Illustrator for asset creation and Android Studio to put together the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was combining all of our work onto one Android Studio project. Three developers worked on different features and combining these features took much longer than we had anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the features we wanted to get into the app worked! Some don't work as well as I would have liked but considering it's my first hackathon, I'm happy with how it turned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should probably all work on the same environment by using a VM or Docker or something else like that to streamline it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Meds Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gain valuable input from the judges and other people to continue to add features without increasing the actual complexity of the app!
