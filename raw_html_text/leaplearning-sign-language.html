                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members had worked with the Leap Motion at a previous hackathon, so we decided to give it another try and help people to learn sign language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the addition of hand signs to the program and then allows users to practice the hand signs by matching them within 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Leap Motion Unity SDK to track hand movements to store the hand signs and then match against them to practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had various troubles implementing the Leap Motion within Unity. Trying to set the positions and rotations of the hands stored in the library proved difficult since they were using a different base position and rotation than the Leap Motion hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to actually get a working proof of concept for the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all gained a better understanding of Unity and the Leap Motion interface. We also learned basic sign language overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LeapLearning: Sign Language
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can expand on the hand poses that are stored within the program. Eventually we would like to add the ability to convert sign language to text and text to sign language.
