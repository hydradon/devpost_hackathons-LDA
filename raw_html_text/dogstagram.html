                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone loves dogs. Everyone likes sharing pictures. Logical conclusion?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to submit photos of their canine companions and have others rate and comment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the mobile app with Android Studio and the server requests with Parse
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to upload photos to the server. We also ran into problems when making the mobile client. We had some sucessful server communication, but time constraints and technical difficulties prevented us from finishing out app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the server communication that does exist. You can sign up and then log in with your credentials.
Also, we have a mock dog description page that is fully functional sans retriving and sending data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the weekend, we learned a lot about server communication and Android development in general. We feel like our second attempt at an app will be a lot more successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dogstagram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The obvious next step would be to learn more about client server communications. With that knowledge, we would be able to create a seamless user experience that we envisioned.
