                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project is wanting to build something that can make a difference in the way students learn. We wanted to make something that can enhance a students learning experience by allowing them interact with the subject in a VR environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    technicAnatomy is a Virtual Reality application hosted on the Oculus Quest. It is an application for learning anatomy and is aimed at any student who needs to learn Anatomy, such as; medical students, nursing students, occupational therapist students, etc.  Within the application, the user will be placed in a medical exam room environment where a human body is found and the parts of the body are interactive. The student can select which ever organ they wish to exam and interact with it. Audio will be provided upon organ selection to provide the student with information on their selection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D as the platform to build the VR environment and we used C# as the driver for the back-end development. We used blender to 3D render the human body and the organs. As a team, we started by brainstorming how we would implement the project. Next, we each worked on different components and put it together and troubleshooted as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was setting up a collaborative environment for the team to start working together. With the Wifi issues we were having, it made it difficult to start the project. To rectify this issue, we moved to a local Starbucks to work until the internet issue was resolved. We also ran into issues grabbing the object and interacting with them. Some objects become displaced after selecting it. Due to time constraints, we were unable to completely rectify this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 of us have never developed a VR application. We are extremely proud to have been able to accomplish setting up the environment, 3D rendering the assets, and ultimately have a functioning VR environment that a user can interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the technical end, we learned how to 3D render objects using blender as well as using C# and Unity to build the environment. We learned to collaborate and brainstorm together as a team as well troubleshoot issues together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for technicAnatomy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon further development, we can really make technicAnatomy a full app for students to use. We will fix the issues that we were unable to fix during this time at Technica and we will add more features and functionality. We want to go beyond just organ interaction. We want to allow the user to select a piece of anatomy to further dissect that piece all the way to its cellular lever.
