                    Baby Yoda is a small station that users can communicate via laptop.
It can add events with time to its local database and remind the user when the user asks it when is the deadline.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use GCP to build the voice to text on the laptop and MQTT to transfer the text to the raspberry pi.
I use 3 Servo and connect them with raspberry pi

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge is setting up the APIs and environment for raspberry pi and how to make it muti-thread.

                    What's next for Baby yoda (schedule reminder)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to make Baby Yoda. So no laptop, but direct communication with it like Alexa. Also, we want it to have some small motion rather than just spinning. Another important feature we wanted to add is cell phone keeper. Baby Yoda will able to keep the cell phone and avoid users try to touch it by spinning before deadlines.
