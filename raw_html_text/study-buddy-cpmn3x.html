                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew the inspiration from struggling to keep track of the massive amount of college work that professors give out on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Amazon's Alexa, students can say the assignments they have at hand and have them recorded to a database. Then, the tasks are organized based on the due date. In tandem with this, whenever a student wants to study, Alexa can suggest which task to do based on different due dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Alexa skill by using serverless Lambda of AWS and Node JS. After that, we stored information in DynamoDB based on different user inputs. Then we built an API on AWS that Flask used to display a dynamic dashboard that tells students their assignments and the tasks they're working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start, we were overwhelmed by different tools that do the same thing so it took us some time to decide what to use. We were conflicted on front-end languages as well as back-end languages to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our electric teamwork and the product we were able to create in the span of 36 hours. Working with a new platform like Alexa is challenging but the documentation is well supported and the community is amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first hackathon, we learned that a lot goes into a project before the base stage is developed. We also learned that persistence is key because of the tediousness of different problems we encountered. We just have to keep moving inches and inches. The mentors at VolHacks helped us tremendously; without them, we don't think we can pull off this entire project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Alexa skill is dynamic and flexible that it can do many other tasks in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve our task suggesting engine so that Alexa can take into account other factors such as the amount of free time a student has and the difficulty of the task.
