                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired when me and some friends were stacking in chairs in real life and thinking of less conventional ways to make a chair tower.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Leap Motion to stack lots of chairs into towers and watch them explode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to import some leap-motion prefabs, and then created our basic chair and added some scripts to slghtly optimise the stacking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted it to be a VR experience using Oculus, but we couldn't get it working on our Laptops. We then wanted to port it to Android but leap motion doesn't support android development and we weren't able to hack our way around it. We also had difficulty with finding a suitable VR headset.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to finally get a just about working product despite wasting over half of the time trying to set up the development environment.
