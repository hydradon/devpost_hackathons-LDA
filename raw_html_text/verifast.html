                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Healthcare professionals often have to move from room to room and device to device during their day. This requires them to log in multiple times into these devices every day, often for very trivial tasks. We wanted to solve this problem by enabling mobile FaceID authentication, so that healthcare professionals can access their devices more easily and work more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Verifast is a mobile app, an authentication server, and a client server. The mobile app requires users to log in for the first time, and then subsequently use FaceID to verify their identity. The client server runs on the computer/device that the user is trying to unlock, and displays a QR code for the terminal. After verifying their identity, the user can scan the QR code to unlock the terminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile app using the iOS SDK and Swift, making use of the built in QR code features. We built the authentication server in node.js and client server in electron.js.

                    What's next for Verifast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we can build a more robust verification system, and enable other forms of verification such as TouchID, other biometric devices, OTP codes, etc.
