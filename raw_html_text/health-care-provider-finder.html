                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to quickly find doctors near you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds the closest doctor based on your location and then texts it to your phone with directions from google maps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated with San Francisco city data to get list of health care providers and then sends text message through Twilio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just started this at around 1 pm after the workshop I wanted was full. Also I was working alone and I'm a total newb when it comes to Alexa and Lamdas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I finished something and it actually works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bunch about Alexa and Lambdas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Care Provider Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots more, I just got started. It could clearly be more interactive, so you can filter the list and it would give you multiple options based on different criteria.
