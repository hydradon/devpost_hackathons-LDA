                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're big fans of the hip-hop artist Gucci Mane, and we've always wanted to play around with Amazon's Alexa system. Voice controls are always a fun gimmick in games, so we decided to try out hooking up the Alexa with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a simple 2D stage, in the style of Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers. The player controls Gucci Mane with the arrow keys. Gucci Mane fires a stream of projectiles, which can be changed by voice commands to the Amazon Echo. For example "Hey Alexa, tell Gucci to set the lemons!" will make Gucci fire a stream of lemons. The available projectiles are: Bricks, Lemonade, and Ice. When the equipped projectile is switched, the background music changes. There's no real gameplay, but it's fun to mess around with it! We think of it as a proof of concept :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new Alexa skill was created using the AWS console, and we connected the skill to an AWS Lambda function which changed the state of a Firebase store. On the Unity side, we polled the Firebase store. The 2D game portions were built following different Unity tutorials. Most of the assets were designed with Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulties at first setting up the Alexa skill. After that, the next issue was connecting the Lambda function with Firebase, and connecting Unity to Firebase. In the end, the hardest part was working with Unity to add enemies and projectiles.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The art came out really well, and the voice commands are really fun to play with!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa skills are really powerful! Setting up new skills with all sorts of intents is actually not that difficult, it just has a little bit of a learning curve because the GUI is a little obtuse.
                </p>
