                    We wanted to build a better Birmingham. In that vein, we decided to encourage Birmingham to visit

                    The Gnu Project uses a proprietary algorithm to search for and select a

                        gnu
                    </strong>
                    caf&eacute; of the day.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python in conjunction with Google Maps Platform to fetch JSON data on local attractions. The web interface we created with HTML+CSS and served with Flask. The server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know what we were doing. Out of the seven tools we used, four we had to learn from scratch. At first, we thought we were going to use Electron, etc., but that would have been too much. As we worked on this project, our ambitions had to scale down to our real capabilities. This was painful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it working! Despite having to trim some features that would have been nice, our final product works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5, CSS, Flask, Google Maps Platform and API. That's alot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More features! The Gnu Project is nothing if not gnu. It has a long life ahead of it.
