                    Connects non-profit organizations who are in need to specific supplies to donors who have those supplies but might not necessarily know who to give it to for most effective use

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Django to build a web app and the Google Maps API to help the donor find the closest organizations

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django was hard to read and follow because it was an unfamiliar structure; debugging is a thing that is hard
