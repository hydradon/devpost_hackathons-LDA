                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the various technologies for object recognition and the need to help the less fortunate around the world. We decided to harness this challenge by creating an app that helps people in daily and social situations better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses tensorflow in order to classify images in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a pre-trained model and made the app speak the object out loud when over a certain degree of confidence.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the classifier we used was not trained that well with everyday objects
                </p>
