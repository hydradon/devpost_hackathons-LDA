                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JIRA is key when it comes to keeping teams in sync and moving projects forward. However, if you are a designer, heads down in Photoshop CC, InDesign CC, or Illustrator CC, saving your work, jumping over to JIRA represents a big context switch that can knock you out of your flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mixin for Adobe Creative Cloud and Jira is a combination of a JIRA add-on and a Adobe extension that allows assets to be attached to JIRA issues directly from Photoshop CC, InDesign CC, and Illustrator CC. While working on an asset, the designer can use the extension to select a JIRA issue and attach the asset to it with on click. They can also comment on the issues and view comments from teammates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Adobe extension is a Node application at runs inside of Photoshop CC et al.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The JIRA extension is a Ruby on Rails application that uses the Atlassian Connect framework. We were able to build on our previous experience developing add-ons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up to speed on the Adobe Extension environment. Node is familiar, but working with the Adobe API, which is heavily callback oriented, require some thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going from zero to a working Photoshop CC extension in the span of a week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to be afraid of the unknown. The Adobe Extension environment seemed daunting at first, but approach methodically, the pieces soon fell into place.
                </p>
