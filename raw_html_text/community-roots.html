                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a user-friendly and clean mobile interface that allows people to freely volunteer for events without having to join a volunteering organization. This way they can meet others and lend a helping hand in the community without having to constantly attend regular meetings and functions.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Community Roots helps people find volunteering opportunities nearby them that they can sign up to take part in. In addition, users can host volunteer events of their own and post them publicly for others to join. All successful events that someone attends or hosts are available on his/her profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and JAVA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the hackathon, we were bouncing between ideas and weren't sure exactly which topic to choose. Community Roots ended up being the combination of a social app to meet and discover similar interests, as well as volunteering for the community. In the end we weren't able to implement our social aspect of the app, and the idea about having profiles was scrapped for this release because of issues regarding obtaining information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have been able to do a lot of work on the development of an Android app despite none of us having prior experience in the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the difficult process of making an Android app, as well as what goes into both the visual and the actual coding aspects of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Community Roots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to improve a lot on the social aspects and interface of the application, in order to make it more appealing to the average person and incentivize others to be active in the community.
