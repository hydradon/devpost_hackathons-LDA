                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a previous competition using IBM Watson, the winning group implemented the AI Watson to sort though various data in the ACS database. The naive children that we were, we never heard of this group and wanted to learn more. A couple hours later and we then learned that it was a for children services. We wanted to use the upcoming hackathon to implement out ideas of how it can make the already difficult lives of foster children just a bit more bearable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product SOSafe is a bracelet that can allow the user to communicate with someone else during a time of need. In this situation we are using it for foster children. Many foster kids are abused and taken advantage of in their foster homes. This device will give the child a voice and let them talk with their assigned case worker whenever they want. It also has a built in alarm that can scare off people when the child is in danger, keeping them safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino,resistors,a potentiometer, a piezo buzzer and the arduino software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working many hours on making sure the hardware was put together correctly and figuring out the the code so that it will do what we want even though we kept making changes to the design and its features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments that we are proud of is that we were able to build a working prototype of the device we had imagined in our minds. After working many hours on making sure the hardware was put together correctly and figuring out the the code so that it will do what we want even though we kept making changes to the design and its features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the foster care system, creating circuits implementing the aurdino sensors and leds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SOSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use our product for a wider range of people, not just foster children. We plan to make it so that people suffering from depression, drug abuse, and teen pregnancies; have someone to lend an ear fro their problems.
