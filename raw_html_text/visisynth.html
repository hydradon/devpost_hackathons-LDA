                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mechanical music box that plays music read from a tape as input.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out puts music based on what is drawn on a strip of paper. The higher a point on paper, the higher the frequency of that note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Houges algorithm for edge detection. Then, prototyping in matlab, we got a line perpendicular to the edges. Then we check each pixel in that line and convert the black points to frequencies and synthesizes them. Then we do this for every frame the camera detects, on android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work in real time. We had to reduce latency as much as possible.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a little about using the camera on android, and some music synthesis.

                    What's next for VisiSynth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fix many bugs. Then maybe put it on the play store for other people to try it out.
