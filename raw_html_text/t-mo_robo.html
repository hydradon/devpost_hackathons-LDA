                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In large businesses, schools, package delivery is inefficient and unreliable. We want to improve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a autonomous robot distribution system that takes packages that have been delivered and then delivers them directly to the recipients office or cubicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With limited access to hardware we decided to implement the system using the Unity Game Engine. We built a simulation that represents how the delivery will work. First the loading dock will have a robot that picks up a large amount of packages and distributes them to the correct floors in the building. Next individual robots will be on each floor and will handle delivering to the individual offices and cubicles. All of the robots will have restrictions coded into them that specify the maximum weight, dimensions, and number of packages it can carry. In addition the robots will not deliver in bathrooms and meeting rooms and has a closed door policy for offices that are having a meeting.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was coming up with a idea that related to digital commerce. Another big problem we ran into was that there was problems with git repositories.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we implemented the navigation system to deliver the packages on each floor to resemble a real life autonomous robot.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that taking breaks was a key portion of coming up with an idea that we could implement with digital commerce.

                    What's next for T-Mo_RoBo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps is to implement our project with hardware that uses GPS to locate if the recipients are in the correct building.
