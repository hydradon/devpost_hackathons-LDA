                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this website due to the need for a UTSU commons page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UTSU Clubs and Events Page, similar to the Facebook groups that currently exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the website completely from scratch, using html and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of our team members know how to use JavaScript, we are still unable to take in the information from the form to submit events to the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the website as a whole! Although we haven't even uploaded it online, were all still really proud that we have a product to present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned lots of new tricks to html, as most of us are a little rusty or are new to html. Plus, brainstorming and teamwork are your best friends.
                </p>

                    What's next for UofT-Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If implemented, we would attempt to add JavaScript to our webpage and complete a sign in page to authorize people who are posting.
