                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes posting a picture in Instagram or Facebook can be more than a hassle when you need to come up with an inspiring, cool, relatable quote. So we decided that we'll help those who are having this exact problem by giving them quote recommendations based on their images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a link to an image or a local image that's uploaded, the web app will give up to 10 quotes that are related to the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can choose to either submit a link to an image or upload his/her own image. We used the Clarifai Image recognition API to obtain the tags of the image. Using these tags, we search through our database of collected quotes, which we did so by crawling websites containing quotes using a simple python script. We search and return the top 10 quotes with the most relatable/ or closest tags from the image. We used Firebase as our backend, handling storage, hosting, and database, which give us a fast development time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was setting up the APIs. It was challenging because we decided that we will use JavaScript for all of our backend. Another notable challenge was figuring out how we can find the most relatable quote from the image. We decided that the web app should prioritize the tags with the highest probability. Given this constraint, it became easier for us to show the quotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that our project was a success. Not only did the web app functions just like we planned, we were surprised to find that most of the quotes we show for a given image have relatable meanings. Although, there are some cases where the tags was mistaken as a verb instead of a noun, and the other way around, making some quotes dissociate from the image, we are quite satisfied that our project was successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides learning about how to use the Clarifai APIs and Firebase, we learned how to structure our project plan and allocate our time well. We also learned how important communication is and most importantly, enthusiasm in creating a collaborative project.
