                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working on a major project for my CS class, and the unit was on concurrent programming. With a few hours before the deadline, all my code seemed to work fine with no errors, but somehow my code was still freezing up.
Standard debugging tools didn't work and I had to rewrite my entire code base, only realizing afterwards that all my problems were from a simple typo that spawned a series of resource-intensive and purposeless threads.
We came up with this tool to help combat such situations that developers who have to deal with multi-threading inevitably face, giving them a unique perspective from which to observe and debug their code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our developer-oriented application creates a controlled run-time environment, that enables live-time visualization of concurrent software architectures. We provide a clean and intuitive interface, relying on intelligent techniques like clustering by functionality similarity to to ensure process visualization is as clear as possible. In addition, we offer a backend service that connects with Google's machine learning cloud servers to intelligently predict broken or buggy threads based off of stack trace data used for our visualization interface.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a Node server, Google's Cloud Platform for Machine Learning, and a local Python server that can trace Python software execution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling network latency and lag from real-time software execution reports, selecting and optimizing machine learning models for intelligent visualization and predictive analysis, and developing a method of extracting Python stack-traces live-time from multiple outside threads.

                <p>
                    Building a visualization tool from the ground up (didn't even end up using JQuery), learning how to use Google's cloud platform, and building a cool product.
