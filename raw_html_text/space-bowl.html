                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game that challenges the player to beat their last high score!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Physics, our original Idea didn't work out, so we had to pivot in-between the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to pivot successfully, and finish a game we were satisfied with in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to have a lighter scope next time so that we don't have to abandon our original idea. Also we learned how to improvise and work through a stressful time to finish.
                </p>

                    What's next for Space Bowl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some light polish on the original game if we had 1 more hour. The best opportunity for this game would probably be porting it to a mobile platform.

                    Space Bowl Plot Synopsis:
                </p>
                <p>
                    An intergalactic bounty hunter must fight his way through endless amounts of aliens with the help of his handy plasma disk and survive for as long as he can, until his inevitable death.
Trained by the ancient masters of HTRAE (Earth backwards), he slices though waves by controlling the direction 
of the disk via his futuristic armour.
