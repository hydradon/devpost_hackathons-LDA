                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to bring people together. One of the team member was in hospital for a whole week and family and friends wasn't there spending time with him the whole time. So we thought why not build an app that connect strangers together base on their current location?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app use user's real time location find other users in close by with similar interest and connect them. Examples could be find some one to work out with you when you at the gym alone, or have some one eat together when you on your lunch break, or find someone else in the library to study with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using React-Native in EXPO for the front end, and we built our own API use Java in Spring.
