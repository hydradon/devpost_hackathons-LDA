                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I remembered that optics was one of the most difficult topics for me for SAT Subject Test for Physics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given an object, it calculates the position, and size of the object, and whether it is real or virtual image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the cloud9 IDE which I am used to from doing workshops from hack club. I used the physics equations I learned from studying the SAT to input the equations for the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some objects that I should had created in the setup function instead of the draw function. There were also some confusion between global variables and local variables. Overall my code was very messy because of the number of variables I had to keep track of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to create a accurate and functioning simulation for a physics concept that I struggled with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the difference between setup and draw function. I also learned how to more effectively use the properties of sprites such as height to shorten code. I am thankful for Max for showing me how to use console to debug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spherical Mirror Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to extend the simulator to include lens, which is the second half of optics. In addition I would like to make it more visually appealing and more flexible.
