                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My good friend always talks about stocks and put me up to this challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sentiment analysis of tweets to gauge twitter feeds. User enters a ticker, and  ultimately an algorithm will give a recommendation to the user whether or not to buy, stay, or sell.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java and the twitter4j API as well as Stanfords NLP library to process sentiment analysis on tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importing libraries, learning about paths, working individually was tough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much. As fun as it was I wish I had team members.  I would have been able to go much further with this algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using an API outside of Java's libraries.  I learned how to navigate through external documentation which was pretty cool,

                    What's next for MarketBird
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully a prize.  Then maybe a job with Twitter!
