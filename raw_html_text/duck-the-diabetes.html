                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With 30.3 million diabetic patients worldwide, Diabetic Retinopathy/deterioration of retina (DR) remains the foremost cause of blindness. DR
                    <strong>
                        Stage Classification
                    </strong>
                    is a manual and time-consuming procedure that needs an expert to evaluate and examine digital fundoscopic images of the retina. By the time experts provide their reviews, the delay leads to a follow-up gap, miscommunication, and late treatment.
                    <em>
                        To tackle this problem, we have devised a revolutionary approach to help doctors detect DR stages in seconds.

                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of our mobile app that is equipped with a highly trained Convolutional Neural Network,
                    <strong>
                        doctors now can classify Diabetic Retinopathy stages in seconds
                    </strong>
                    . Early stage detection will help prevent diabetes in patients.

                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a dataset of 160 images and created augmentation scripts to generate 4000 images. Next, we used a machine learning algorithm to train the CNN and added an additional bottleneck layer to TF Inception Architecture. Post that, we applied  K-cross validation technique to check accuracy. We tried different sets of data to find out the most efficient combination.
                    <em>
                        Finally, we converted our CNN to an Android readable format and made an app using it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data Augmentation scripts were difficult to implement as we had to use a lot of different techniques to achieve the desired results. Adding bottleneck was time-consuming and conversion of CNN to an Android readable format was a complicated task.

                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to make a user friendly DR stage classification mobile app that will assist doctors in helping patients and preventing diabetes.
                    <strong>
                        We are also pleased with getting 89-100% accurate results on average.

                    To use Python and TensorFlow for training the Inception CNN. We also learned about various augmentation techniques like rotations, flips, zoom-in-out, contrast, and adding noise. Additionally, we learned about InceptionNet CNN and how to train it. Moreover, converting CNN to an Android readable format was a major learning task.
