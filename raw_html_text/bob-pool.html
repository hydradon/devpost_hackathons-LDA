                    The word

                    </em>
                    stands for eating a meal together with other people, and sharing the dishes. Our team wanted to develop an app that can help individuals like us who
                    <strong>
                        love food
                    </strong>
                    and try different menus but cannot finish the whole meal by themselves, cannot pay all the food themselves, or simply does not want to eat alone.

                        Bob Pool
                    </em>
                    allows the user to look up near restaurants or favorite places and add a pool request so that other people can join. The user can set date, time, a maximum capacity for the pool, and leave a note like "I want to share half of the pizza." When someone else wants to join, the user gets a notification about it, and can simply meet them at the place.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Java, Android Studio to build the app; we used Google Maps API for getting nearby restaurants. We also implemented Firebase database console to manage the user accounts and pool requests and AWS SNS to send SMS messages to users when the pool is matched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time pressure was our biggest challenge, considering the fact that we only had less than two days to compose and build a project. Team members came up with brilliant ideas, and it was difficult to settle to one idea that can be built in a short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to cooperate together and build a high fidelity prototype. The coding process was intense, and we learned so much during this time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize Firebase to store and retrieve data from a database, and the use of AWS to send messages through the application that we have created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bob-Pool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team want to go further and implement a chat room that can allow users to communicate each other before deciding to meet at the restaurant. We also want to connect social media accounts to let their friends know that they are planning to eat outside, and want more friends to join.
