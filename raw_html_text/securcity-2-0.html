                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blaine's uncle works in the pentagon and he wanted an app to keep his family more secure, but we took that inspiration and gave it a spin towards the court systems.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SecurCity 2.0 is a tool to rapidly increase the court systems through updated task processing. Using the information from the local courts, the app gets all the current information that is needed for work outside of the courthouses. It would include anything from services to warrants for policemen and notaries. As those going out to complete these tasks report and fill out the paperwork, the app instantly updates that information, and includes the attached documents of the court, so that the information is available and can be continued back in the court system.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application using a lot of AngularJS, using an Angular Material structure system. The data was handled by Firebase, and we used a part of Firebase called GeoFire in order to get location in a fast and easy way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our challenges included a lack of understanding about the court system and an ability to really know how to benefit such a long-standing framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really proud of being able to use GeoFire and produce a viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we work best as a team when we are honest with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SecurCity 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has a lot of potential in speeding up every court process out there. With the proper data, and the time to build, SecurCity 2.0 could transcend the levels of court proceedings, and bring the speed and protection that democracy can sometimes lack.
