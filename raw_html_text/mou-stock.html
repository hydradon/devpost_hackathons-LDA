                    We are a bunch of people who have decent experience with the stock market back home in india. When we went back and thought about the difficulties we went through as newbies to the field we wondered if there is a way In which any person who wants to get into trading can start investing as soon as he feels the need to do so without any prior knowledge. Stocks and commodities are obviously considered one of the simplest ways to make money and this is going to help in bringing more users to the app
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based a persons salary and investment capabilities the app automatically suggests the ranges of stocks/companies the user can invest in. This is done by using the Nessie API to obtain account details.
We looked at major characteristics that help in determining a stocks value such as PE Ratio, market volatility etc. and devised a suitable predicting mechanism.

                <p>
                    Data about a range of stocks where not available. therefore various other characteristics could not be determined
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using various apis and softwares to come up with something like this for the first time
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned : DATA IS NOT FREE
                </p>
                <p>
                    Develop the existing app and interface with a more optimized algorithm after more market research and datasets.
Finally evolving into a company
