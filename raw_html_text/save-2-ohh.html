                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving money by optimizing the use of water in California from farmers, we do not want to get in another drought, and almond milk is getting expensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses weather predictions to optimize the water use of farmers, because they will not have to water on certain days
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a webapp using different api's from (as of now) private companies to get a compilation of weather data to be able to predict the amount of water needed for the month, and letting the farmer know how much they would save.
