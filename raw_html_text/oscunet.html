                <p>
                    We realize that on most community-based platforms does not support on-the-fly services. What this means is if a platform is missing a feature, users will have to send feed backs and wait for software update. However, features that users need
                    <strong>
                        aren't always big
                    </strong>
                    ; In majority,
                    <strong>
                        users seek only minor tweaking
                    </strong>
                    . Our project aim to provide a solution to this problem.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    In general, we will allow users of our platform to implement
                    <em>
                        plugins
                    </em>
                    for our website that does some arbitrary computation. This plugin system will support web, so ideally plugins will be in javascript.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a REST API in VB.NET and a Database and JSON data parser in C#. 
Peer-to-peer client in VB.NET
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anonymity is a flag in our project. We consider anonymity an important feature but is not required.
                    <strong>
                        Security
                    </strong>
                    was the biggest concern for us. We discussed about solutions to prevent our platform from becoming malicious or botnet-like .
