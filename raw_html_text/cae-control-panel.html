                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is from the CAE challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a flight control simulator. It can show planes around a given airport and demonstrate routes that planes would have to take. It also has a small cloud drive to store files for the pilot. And for demo purposes, we used videos on loop that would normally be live video feeds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the front end web languages (HTML5, CSS3, JS) and PHP. The text editor of choice for this team was Atom and Brackets for our Mac users. (XAMPP and Wamp to run PHP)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the main challenges were CSS alignment as the iframes would simply not want to be resized and the cloud feature was incredibly hard as the upload feature was causing issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cloud upload feature and the route directions for the plane control panel are the features we are most proud of. We are also proud of the control simulation page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to use PHP and learned other technologies like teletype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CAE Flight Control Panel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this app as a challenge so the decisions regarding the future of this project will most likely be taken by CAE.
