                    Scrape CSV files and extract key elements from multiple big data sets of eCommerce transaction logs and insert it into a query driven database to determine if a respective transaction log is tagged as fraudulent activity or not

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing mySQL and MySQLWorkbench for the backend software

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time working with big data sets and databasing in general, and coming in with barebones knowledge of the software, and concepts were difficult to learn how to implement with the given time constraint for the Hackathon.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the general concepts of databasing, text scraping and the ability to stay up for 50 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data base structuring, stored procedures, text scraping, mySQL, and Tableau
                </p>

                    What's next for Fraud_TesterSQL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time we would have implemented a more integrated and user friendly front end interface, and add a couple key lookup features that previously were not available, and the ability to potentially color code the logged transactions to denote the level of perceived fraud. (red means fraud was detected, yellow means fraud was potentially committed by the user in another instance, and green means no fraud was detected.)
