                    Service providers, even government ones can be inefficient. There are major potholes that are left for long periods of time without getting fixed, or FAA regulations that disallow someone renting a hangar to change a single light bulb. These wait periods can easily reach beyond a year. What if you could use a smart contract to put a bounty out to get this fixed? Underfunded schools in P.R are one of the best examples that could benefit immediately from having such a bounty put out in a smart contract.

                    Nicole went to an underfunded school where there was a significant hole in one classroom. It took 1.5 years for the hole to get fixed. This school was in Wisconsin, and in winter students wore winter coats, gloves and hats in a classroom that was 30 degrees.

                        Option in Step 2 when the contractor is wanting to accept the gig. The ability to request/add a quote- maybe even independent quotes.  This is so someone can get a baseline of what a FMV (fair market value) or local cost for the job will be.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the bounty is low or just not getting accepted; someone else can increase the bounty by paying a small fee of $1. Considering that someone could mess with the price of a bounty for certain reasons (competition) there should be a maximum percentage that the bounty could be increased from it's original amount. Also, contractors should be barred from changing the price.
