                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WhatsApp is an ubiquitous program that everyone uses. However, unlike competitors like Telegram, it does not have an API for personal accounts, which limits the use of the application to solely communication via calls or messaging. Considering the growth of smart assistances and chatbots in other mediums, we were looking to offer similar functions to something we use very often - WhatsApp.

                <p>
                    wa++ is a library that allows programs to interact with users via WhatsApp. wa++ enables you to turn your personal WhatsApp account into a chatbot, whose program you can either use current pre-added functionalities or you can build your own simply. The possibilities are limitless - listed below are examples of functionalities we have pre-added into the software.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Python and a framework called Selenium to automate the browser interaction for Whatsapp Web. First, we wrote the API functions that our bots would be built on, such as sending and receiving messages. After ensuring that these functions worked as intended, we then proceeded to build some simple bots to demonstrate the API, such as an auto-reply bot and games like hangman and guess the number. We also tried to get as many friends as possible to test our bots, to make sure they worked properly.
