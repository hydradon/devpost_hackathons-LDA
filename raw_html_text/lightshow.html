                    A realtime audio visualizer that utilizes microphone input from your browser to generate visual effects similar to popular youtube channels like NCS and DubstepGutter.

                        Issues we ran into
                    </strong>
                    We thought the backend would be pretty straight forward and we would spend more time making the ui look good for the user, but we ran into a lot of difficulty creating an audio spectrum from the frequency data that the audio analyzer returned. In the end we decided to move on to the UI and leave the audio spectrum as it is. Ultimately, the end goal is for the audio spectrum and the size of the circle in the middle to react ONLY to the bass of the audio.
