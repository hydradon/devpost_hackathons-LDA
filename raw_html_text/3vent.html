                    We wanted to bring the community together. We provide promotion for local businesses that want to promote special deals to just wanting to meet other people at local social events.

                    3Vent is an android application that aggregates local events and shows what types of events are going on around you. This includes events like discounts  and special sales at stores, or even parties if you just want to go out and have fun. It shows what the event is called, a description of the event, where it is, and what it will take place at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built this android app using Java and XML primarily in XML and using both operating systems of Ubuntu and Windows. We used Java for backend and event handling part of the programming for the android app as well as using that to create a basic TCP server to serve as a server for our database of events on our app. We used XML for designing the UI for the android app and connecting the front end portion of the app to the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into various problems with servers so we ended up going with creating and hosting our own Java TCP server from a Ubuntu laptop. We also ran into a lot of problems with the Facebook API therefore we weren't able to incorporate a Facebook login and connection to Facebook events as a result into the prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to create our TCP server and host on there and able to incorporate a working database with our android app. We also created and designed all our buttons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with the Google Maps Android API and gained more experience writing android apps in general. This was also a good experience in project management/planning. We found ourselves going back and changing some aspects of the design later on as they weren't fully compatible with our design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app would be expanded to work to integrate social networks. This would provide two uses: one it would help verify users and reduce spam on the system. Second, it would give another resource for local events to populate.
