                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movies spend a lot of time on audio, so it is clearly important for story telling. We thought people could become more immersed in books if they heard audio relevant to what they are reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Amazon's Comprehend Machine Learning API to scan pages of books for keywords, then plays ambient audio which matches what is going on in the book.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SwiftUI for the user interface and a python webserver built with flask to interact with the Amazon Web Services API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially tried to use react native, but decided it was going to complex to learn so quickly, so we pivoted to using SwiftUI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though SwiftUI was praised for being intuitive online, we had a hard time adapting to it and figuring out how to get it to suit our needs. Everything we built was a first for us, so we learned a lot and made tons of mistakes along the way.
