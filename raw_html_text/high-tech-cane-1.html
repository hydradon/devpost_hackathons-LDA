                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a recent survey in the US with 300 visually impaired citizens where several questions were asked. One of these questions were regarding accidents a year. More than half stated that they were in an accident at least once a month. Our project is a simple solution to prevent these accidents in the future to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea has two parts. 
The first part is a HELP sign for when a user is in distress. By pushing a button, a light will be activated around our 3D printed sign. This then allows citizens walking by to understand and possibly be able to help to depend on the situation. 
The second part is a motor that would be used to vibrate a hand when an object is approaching. A push button was used to replicate a proximity sensor.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made many designs and later took online tutorials about coding. We had help from mentors when it came down to specifics.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, there was major dispute about ideas.
Our motor did not seem to turn after many tries

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to have our HELP Button flash when wanted. It was a great learning experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement LEDs, Push Buttons and Motors into an Arduino UNO
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for High Tech Cane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to use an ultrasonic sensor in replacement of the push button which senses an object coming towards the person before it hits them. We would also like to use a Piezo Buzzer in replacement of the DC Motor which is what vibrates the cane to alert the person there is something in there way which could cause them trouble. Also, we would like to find a working code for the piezo motor.
