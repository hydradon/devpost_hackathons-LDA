                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between elderly people, especially in hospitals, are never quite efficient. There can be many different reasons why there may be communication problems - perhaps the elderly person in care has a mental illness or they are physically frail. We wanted to create an app that would optimize the efficiency in communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bari is a communication application with 2 parts. The management and caretakers will have an online dashboard where they can see a brief list of all the elderly people in the retirement home (or hospital). The elderly will have a simple app, where they can make requests and help via speech. The speech will then be transformed into text and sent to the management's dashboard. On the dashboard, management will be able to meet more requests in detail than traditional phone calls or pagers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the team into 2 - one would work on the front-end and design, while the other would work on the back-end. On the front-end team, they had a strong user focused mindset, which set all the goals we needed to achieve to complete this project. The back-end team were hard at work, learning new languages and new technology. We focused a lot of our time on the Speech-To-Text implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was getting our own personal servers to work. The app was unable to connect due to unknown reasons, which set us back by a large sum of time. While that was the biggest challenge, we had a lot of obstacles learning new languages such as nodeJS, implementing Ai, and playing around with anything we thought would contribute to the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our application can be used in many places, and would help maximize the efficiency in a world where many people are growing old. There's a lot of potential in our app, and while there were many challenges, we learned a lot in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot on this project. We played around with a lot of different technology, and learned the importance of organization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bari - The Elderly Response App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The possibilities are endless! We are thinking of including AI technology to further maximize communication and interaction with the elderly.
