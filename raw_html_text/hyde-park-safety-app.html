                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often receive security alerts about crimes near the UChicago campus so we'd like to find safer walking routes, especially because our Masters classes are at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the emergency campus phones' locations and recent crime areas. It shows safe routes based on police reports, density of currently open stores, and user-reported suspicious activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Java backend and a React.JS frontend. We utilized the Google Maps API for visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is relatively new to web development so getting everything set up and studying documentation was difficult. We have not tried utilizing two different languages for a web app before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an app that can be useful since we had varying experience levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few of us learned how to use Git and version control, as well as setting up a web app.
                </p>
