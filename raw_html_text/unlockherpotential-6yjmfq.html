                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gender gap in STEM is more evident then ever and we have the technology to change it. Kids at a young age are very aspirational and we want to influence their dreams through this app. We also targeted towards the kids who weren't interested in STEM, so we changed the "dress-up" model to reward dresses from STEM professionals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has multiple levels and different games to get points to unlock certain "dresses" in the end that are STEM inspired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used XCode and used the language swift.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Had to re-do project because team left early and never shared earlier code. Never used Xcode before or hacked.
                </p>
