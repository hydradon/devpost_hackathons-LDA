                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to utilize emerging AI technologies to have a more conversational interaction with customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this particular demo it allows you to order pizza from our WooCommerce shop portal via facebook chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used API.ai for our artificial intelligence we trained it with common pizza ordering commands.
Our website is primarily Wordpress, but the backend communication layer was custom built in order to translate API.ai's json to WooCommerce's json.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfortunately unable to release our complete implementation due to no one wanting to buy an SSL certificate that is required by WooCommerce.
However had we overcome this our chat bot would have been functionally available on facebook chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our implementation of API.ai with our backend service was able to parse through and communicate data from API.ai to WooCommerce and vise versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In depth understanding of API.ai functionality.
A better understanding of how Webhooks and Rest API's work.
Don't be cheap, and buy the dang SSL certificate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WooBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buy an SSL certificate and release the bot. 
Afterwards create a global WooBot market place that connects all WooCommerce sites together allowing purchases from all over the internet.
