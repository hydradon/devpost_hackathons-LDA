                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the great real-time collaborative abilities of Google Docs. Due to the general lack of real-time collaborative tools similar to Google Docs for image editing, we decided to create one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows many people to collaborate on one piece of art at the same time, and to talk to each other about it through a text chat. In theory, it would allow greater collaboration between artists or graphic designers, increasing productivity for a group of people who sometimes find it hard to collaborate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to create a client-server model built from the ground up. The only framework used is the built-in Java API. The chat system was made separately, but then combined into the main system. The website is hosted on Cycle, but the program's server runs separately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty reducing the latency between the server and the clients. We also had trouble debugging the many problems inherent in developing a program under time pressure. We at first struggled to work as a team, but as time progressed, we gained a better understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were extremely proud of creating the entire system in fewer than 24 hours. On top of that, we were able to accomplish nearly every goal that we began with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things that we learned was how to effectively work in a team. Some of us also were able to gain a better understanding of web design/development and how programming languages work as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Take Part in Shared Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be sharing the program with other students from our school over the next few weeks. We hope to receive feedback on it and subsequently make improvements.
