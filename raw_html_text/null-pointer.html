                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal Difficulties in finding a place to stay in a completely new environment (Banglore Rocks.!!)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our App is User Aware . It identifies the user preferences by carefully understanding the history and data points from his endpoints (facebook profile). then it selects the best places based on an algorithm that associates weights to each preferred parameter, which are customizable too..!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get the user preferences, we identify him as single or married, based on his likes and current working status we identify his office location and preferences. using google places API we identify the rented flats based on his top six preferences. we also provide him with the option to adjust weight-age to those parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users Mostly liked different and weird stuff like lamps, cat, wolvarine, we had to categorize his likes under specific roof, so for example liking coffee means he may prefer a CCD nearby. 
the algorithm to identify the preferred location is our uniqueness, it finds the center of mass of the polygon with vertex 
as our preferred lat lng.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The unique way to solve the problem. we are able to completely remove the search box. Our Algorithm to identify the preferred location is great too.
