                    Inspiration :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted flashcards online that can display photos.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes user's input and stores them in a local storage and then tests us.

                <p>
                    Friendship and youtube. We would like to thank Jon Wu and Stack Overflow.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we're freshmen, we did not have much knowledge about coding. The ideas we came up with at first were way too complicated for us, so we came up with this instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to work together and coding something that might be useful in the future for other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:

                    javascript, json, jquery, html

                <p>
                    We want to be able to insert photos, have it accessible offline, different kinds of testing of knowledge,
