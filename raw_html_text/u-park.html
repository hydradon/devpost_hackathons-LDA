                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traffic in densely populated cities is a growing problem and obvious frustration and there aren't any great solutions. Driving around cities like Los Angeles, we noticed that there were many unused parking spots. What if homeowners, while out and about for the day, could rent out their unused parking space, whether its their drive way or garage, to make extra income? Then another person, who usually spends a lot of time and money looking for a parking spot, could use that space. U-Park was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where AirBnb allows users to rent peoples homes, U-Park allows users to rent people's parking spaces. A user can search a location on the map, and find parking spaces around that area. They can then rent the spot hourly, weekly, or for an extended period. A user will be able to register their space within the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and Java to create the framework mobile application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using esri's API in which we did not have much experience in. Implementing esri's API effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how some of esri's API works as well what resources were available to help make it happen. Also figuring out workarounds for some API features (internet was unreliable at some moments for us). Overall, having a working application using Esri's API in the time allocated to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The value of APIs and how much more can be done using them effectively.
                </p>

                    What's next for U-Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding additional functionality to U-Park.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Filters so users can search by city, state, zip, address.
