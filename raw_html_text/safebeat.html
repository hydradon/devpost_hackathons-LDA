                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A requirement of unobtrusive monitoring of Vital signals in the Neonatal intensive care unit and the possibility to do it based on research motivated us to take this up to develop a Remote Health monitoring system - SafeBeat
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of our implementation is Unobtrusive Vital sign monitoring. The heart rate is monitored through the video of the person taken through Laptop camera. This is based on the Research paper in Video health monitoring (Robust pulse-rate from chrominance-based rPPG, 2013). We further developed the end-end system on Remote health monitoring by notifying the doctor about anomalies in the patients heart rate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the signal processing and Mathematical computations on Matlab and used Javascript and Python to develop the doctor notification and Webpage creation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with signal processing from the image, integrating different modules in different languages in creating an MVP.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could get the pulse rate from the video based on the paper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that converting the research paper information into code is not easy. Also the integration of different modules helped a few of us learn a little Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeBeat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the product only measures Heart rate and it must be tested exhaustively for accuracy. Other vital signals like Blood pressure and Respiration rate should also be included in the system.
