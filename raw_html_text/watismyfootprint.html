                    This app was inspired by the University of Waterloo Sustainability Action Plan which hopes to create a carbon neutral environment on campus by the end of 2050. We wanted to bring awareness to students of their carbon footprint on the campus and provide a database for the university to use to see where they could improve on reducing the overall carbon footprint.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This app will identify the material of an item in a picture and calculate the amount of carbon that was emitted during the creation. The app will then track this for the day and then a week to showcase a long term period of carbon footprint.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This app was built using Android Switch using Firebase as the backend and Firebase ML Kit for image recognition. Various parts of the app were built using Python and Java.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We had a difficult time implementing the image recognition portion, which still is not fully implemented in the system but we hope to implement it in the future.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of creating an app which has multiple features as we never had previous experience with any of the languages and API's. To be able to create something tangible was very rewarding for us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned about UI/UX, Backend Development, App Development, overall programming, problem solving and troubleshooting.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We hope to properly integrate the Image Recognition API so that it can identify the materials properly as well as food. Then we hope to be able to connect it to home utilities as well as transportation to get a greater range for our carbon footprint.
