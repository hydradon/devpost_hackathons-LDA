                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to try something new with python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It just emails the users the top posts from the subreddits
The user has to PM the email and the subreddits to a reddit account (badolaay) with semicolon ';' as delimiter
For example:
                    <a href="mailto:abc@mail.com" rel="nofollow">
                        abc@mail.com
                    </a>
                    ;programming;askreddit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used reddit api for getting the reddit data and mailgun for sending emails
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I thought of making subreddit and read the uses email from there.
But this would expose the emails so I opted for PM
                </p>

                <p>
                    I created something in less than 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    Using python, reddit api and sending emails
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploy on AWS, avoid manual authorization for each user email at mailgun
Sort the posts/comments as per user preference
