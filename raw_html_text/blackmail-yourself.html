                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "For the last few months, I had been falling behind on a lot of projects that I
                    <em>
                        wanted
                    </em>
                    to finish but couldn't find the motivation to do so. To try and get myself moving, I made a contract with a close friend, offering my twitter password for an entire Feburary if I didn't make a deadline by the end of the January. I thought that if I put myself against the clock while knowing the consequences of my inactivity then I would be able to push myself to produce projects on time. A couple discord calls and big memes later, the idea for blackMailYourself was born." - Cal

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    blackMailYourself creates a contract between a person and their accountability buddy. A user will fill out a contract form, in which they provide a task, dirty secret, passphrase, and specific deadline. In order to maintain privacy, the secret is encrypted using the passphrase, hashed a second time, then stored while the passphrase is kept between the user and their buddy. If the task is incomplete by the deadline, blackMailYourself will allow the buddy to unlock the dirty secret by providing the passphrase. Hopefully by some miracle, these contracts motivate the user to finish whatever it is they set out to do.
