                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change and energy efficiency are hot topics in the future of city planning, of which In this project we have developed a solution to improve home heating without losing quality of life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app computes the time needed for a room at temperature T1 to reach temperature T0 with a set of heaters (which are heat sources). Then, it returns either the time at which the room will be heated if the thermostat is turned on immediately, or the time at which the thermostat has to be turned on, so the room is heated before a given time.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is done with Python, since it allows to do different oriented processes with a single program. We have implemented the heat diffusion equation in Python with the help of NumPy and wrapped the web app with Flask. To track the heating process, the Telegram bot
                    <code>
                        @WorldWarmBot
                    </code>
                    is paired with the main web app and gives information about the remaining time and the current room temperature. For this project, the current temperature is given by an Arduino board and a temperature source.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with user interfaces, since our Physics background is more oriented to numerical simulations. In addition, it was our first hackathon, so we learned the importance of having a well-prepared coding baggage. Having previous codes and adapting them to our current project has fortunately saved us a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been able to get into the basics of collaborative coding, i.e. merging different codes and having in mind the diverse coding styles of the group members.
