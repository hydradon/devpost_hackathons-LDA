                    Our project maps the Citi Bike stations of New York City and models the busyness/activity of the stations.  It is a simple web application; we used the traffic accidents data set to create a map of New York, and we allow for user interaction - showing station activity (i.e. Citi Bike customers departing or arriving at stations) at different times of the day (ex. morning, afternoon, night), day of the week (weekday, weekend) and season (summer, winter) which the user can choose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and Javascript for front-end user interaction to display the map and toggle buttons. We used Python for back-end to parse and analyse the given datasets.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Python and HTML together ie. connecting front and back-end
Clustering the bike stations according to location and frequency of occurrences in the data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We learned Python and used it to handle, analyze, and manipulate big data.
                </p>
