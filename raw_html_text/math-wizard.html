                    'Math Wizard' is total fun. It's got so many facts. Some related to geometry, some are related to algebra and some are just interesting number facts like "What comes after a million, billion and trillion?" and "How Google got its name after a number googol". Not only this, you can also choose to start a math quiz wherein Alexa asks you simple true/false questions and scores you out of 5 such questions. It's really fun to try and also you get to learn a lot at the same time.

                    It's your gateway to knowledge and wisdom when it comes to maths. It has got so many interesting math facts to tell you. You can simply go on asking all the math facts from Alexa.

                    I have shared the demo of this Alexa skill here. It's very simple and easy to use. All you have to ask Alexa is to start this skill and then just keep asking for facts. You can also ask for a fact while launching the skill. 
You can also ask Alexa to start a quiz as well. Alexa will ask you 5 questions and you simply answer in true or false.
