                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the HTML Tech Talk, Jared created a webpage that was a spin-off of Adidas. The spin off was the greatest thing ever known to man, Fadidas.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acts as a webpage, however it isn't hosted or have its own domain. Essentially it is a place to buy fake Adidas for not only the full price of originals, but also it more expensive.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attending the first HTML tech talk, we immediately went to coding in HTML (since it was really the only way we knew how to code anything.)

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge because we had little to no experience or a college student to help us. However, with our minimal combined knowledge and the internet, were we able to figure out the majority of our obstacles. We weren't able to make the pictures hid behind the horizontal navigation bar

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, we didn't know how to do anything really (not trying to make any excuses) as of yesterday. But now we are here! We did everything by ourselves and it's so impressive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How easy coding really is and that how to code HTML.

                    Nothing, this is blatant copyright.
