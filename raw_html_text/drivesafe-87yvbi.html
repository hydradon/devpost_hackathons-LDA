                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, many innocent people are killed by drunk driving, rage driving, etc. Most of these people are teenagers, like us. In an effort to save many innocent lives and to avoid teenagers falling into the trap of drinking and driving, rage driving, we created Drive Safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drive Safe uses Computer Vision to recognize your emotions and to determine if your angry or drowsy and acts accordingly. Additionally, we added traffic and weather integration which informs you at which time to leave safely and if to leave or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tools: tensorflow,keras, Google Distance Matrix API, Open Weather Map API, Python, Flask-Ask, Alexa, dlib, opencv.
We built it by training a neural network which classifies if the person is angry or not. Then, using 2 APIs we developed a traffic and weather aspect in order to help the user get places safely and efficiently.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were integration with the API and end to end integration with Alexa.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating everything and solving each problem and making a full application and the Biggest of all, using Alexa for the first time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate our code with Alexa and how to create Alexa Skills, making a neural network.

                <p>
                    In the future, making this world-wide and using Audio Sensors.
