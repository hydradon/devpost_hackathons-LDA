                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we just want our family and friends to be with us, even if we are miles away from them. The closest we get to this is video chatting with them- but it still feels unreal. This very thought inspired me to create an
                    <em>
                        immersive way of video chatting
                    </em>
                    wherein it would seem that the person you are talking to is standing right in front of you and both of the peers are in the same environment using Virtual Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sair, in Hindi means to go on for a peaceful walk or a stroll with someone. This is what this platform does exactly. The conceptual version picks up two people who are video chatting and semantically segment them from their current environment, in real time and put the person in virtual space of each other. The segmented body in the VR space makes you feel that the other person and you are both in the same space and thus justifying the term immersive video chatting...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole platform was built in three layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Layer - 1) The basic video chat feature was built by exchanging tokens &amp; creating a basic P2P connection. This conventional way of video chat streaming was the easiest way out to replicate a video chat feature. It was made using React, Javascript, nodejs, peerjs, socket-io and similar web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Layer - 2) As soon as the video chat platform was ready, it was time for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation essentially means to pick the person's body from the current environment and subtract the environment from the video stream such that the body is the only object being streamed. I initially started to write my own neural net with OpenCV to do that, but the rendering of one video of 8 seconds in non-real time took about 1 hour on my local machine. Hence I came across, Bodypix library by google scholar which I tweaked a bit to get what I wanted and in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Layer - 3) Now since I had a semantically segmented body in real time, I just have to stream it on the Virtual Reality Environment. 
To do this, I initially thought of writing the same P2P code (which I wrote in Layer 1)- with React360. But React360 comes with limitations of javascript and HTML5 components. So, I kept the real time segmentation and video stream part for version 2.0 which would be made with Unity instead of React 360. For now, you could record a message on the web portal(Layer-1) and send it to the user using dropbox API. As soon as you stop recording the message from layer 1 - it pushes the message to DropBox App Server. The Virtual Reality App in layer-3, downloads the message from the DropBox App Server and is meant to play that message which has all the segmentation features and makes you feel that the person is right in front of you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        React 360 is very restrictive way to do this. It does not support the segmentation part on user's end- hence we have to stream the segmented video. It also just plays video which are in the local asset store...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currently I am just playing a video which I have stored in the local asset store- but the dropbox app server request does work and the downloading does take place. It is just - I wasn't sure about the location of the directory where the downloaded file was saved and ran out of time to figure it out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Initially the segmentation also took a lot of time and efforts. The problem with segmentation is, currently the video is streamed from one user to another user, from where it goes to google's open source GPUs and then is streamed back after segmentation. This requires high processing and compression rate which as lossless as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currently the app is not able to live stream the video chat because of React 360's limitation- but the idea can surely be implemented with Unity and better tech stack

                    <li>
                        The very idea of immersive platform for video chat is an accomplishment in itself. It is going to revolutionize the social networking idea in future. It has applications in corporate and personal lives as well.

                    <li>
                        The real time segmentation is lossy but still works. To pull off a video chat segmentation was a great learning for me.
