                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michigan State currently does not have a bus tracking app on campus, and it is an idea that will benefit many people (as well as us, the developers).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WMB will tell you when the next bus will arrive at the nearest bus stop to you, your most recently visited, or your favorite bus stops.  Additionally, there is a map view in which you can see, in real time, all of the buses on campus and their positions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the android app in android studio using Java, and the backend was developed in phpStorm using php and a mySQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few problems with the quality of the data received from the CATA feeds, as well as the fact that we're only allowed to pull real time bus data twice per minute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we  were able to meet many of our pre-hackathon goals, and were able to implement something that will be useful to potentially thousands of students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WMB - Where's my Bus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement predictive bus locations to fill in the gap between pulls from the CATA feeds.  Also, we plan to give the user a chance to tell us their destination, and we will give them an estimated time of arrival.
