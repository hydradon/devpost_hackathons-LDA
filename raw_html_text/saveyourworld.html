                    Climate change is a huge problem in our world today. If we do not take action soon, it will become irreversible, affecting our futures drastically. One of the major problems is that many people do not know much about global warming. Our solution to this problem is education. Through educating people, we can influence them to make more environmentally friendly choices. Our targeted audience is younger kids, as it is better to start learning about these important issues at a younger age. By educating them early on, they can start helping earlier, and can have more time to pick it up as an interest. Through these games, kids can learn about the environment in fun ways, as well as having factual notes to go along with it.
