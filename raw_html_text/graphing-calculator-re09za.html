                    -We wanted to create a functional graphing calculator with using a good and trusty programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Our calculator does what most graphing calculators do. It takes input from a user and has the capability to compute numbers and graph lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We built our calculator using google, sheer willpower, and chicken on a raft.

                </p>
                <p>
                    -We really struggled because of our lack of knowledge in setting up the library framework. We also had a lack of knowledge when it came to setting up our LCD which caused us some setbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We are pretty proud of ourselves that we made something that works. Kind of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We learned how to use a TFT LCD with a raspberry pi, how to make a button matrix with button interrupts with a raspberry pi, and how to get scripts to run on startup with a raspberry pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Future advancement of knowledge.
