                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An immersive VR experience that takes the user through a unique gardening experience where every plant plays its own instrument taking part in a soundscape of &ldquo;plant-created&rdquo; music around the user. As the user waters the plants, music grows out of their garden. By watering each plant, the user can fill the &ldquo;water status indicator&rdquo; for each plant, allowing for a beautiful outcome in the end; the imagery and sound of their efforts realized, and presented as a &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; of that effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a dedicated team that gathered different talent, Unity developer, CAD designer, UI/UX specialists, and a sound designer, we combined our efforts to be able to use Unity, Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit and ArmSwinger VR Locomotion System. We created a Circular Garden, taking into consideration the transition of sounds and the volume of the closest plants while establishing a grid illustration that allows usability, natural moves, and harmony of the sounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We worked on creating original musical phrases of increasing intensity to be attributed to the plant assets. Each of the 9 different plants had 3 different musical phrases which are representations of the 3 potential plant states (Wilted, needs water, and health) The sound layers interchange as we get closer to other plants making 729 different possibilities of musical combinations possible as the user chooses which plants to water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we grew through overcoming challenges as, the iterative processes within the team, being able to prioritize features for building an effective demo with the given timeframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud from the beginning of the process: creating and brainstorming for an idea that combined two ideas coming from two groups of people came up with and decided to compromise in order to give birth to this new idea. Isn&rsquo;t that how great ideas are born?
We were also all eager to learn and ask for help. The team has great energy and is very complimentary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we learned that VR helped us bridge our Imagination from what we see in Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Garden of Sounds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In development: At the end of our demo, the user is presented with an apple from which they can discover seeds for growing their next garden. Users will be able to grow their own garden of sounds.
Use cases: This could be an open experience through the BSO connecting people to music the world around them in a way that they can only experience that in VR. Also, some museums would be interested in providing that experience, or even some education centers where we are involving technology in the curriculum to teach children about nature and Fauna and Flora.
