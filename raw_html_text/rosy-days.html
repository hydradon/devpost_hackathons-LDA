                    As a group of first time hackers, we floundered for a bit when it came to team formation. Eventually, an old idea was brought up and new life was breathed into it; our team decided that we wanted to ensure a convenient way for people with female genitalia could easily access feminine hygiene products without ever saying a word. Users in need would connect to others within a one mile vicinity, and if anybody had a product to spare, they could pass it on in response to the notifications sent out. We also briefly considered putting an ad platform so that a monetary fund would be created to have lasting benefits for people who did not have consistent access to menstrual products and also to fund calls to the person's state government to repeal the "pink tax." However, we realized that these features were a little too much to complete in 24 hours.
 First, our team tried to implement the matching api through flutter, but after many many hours of failed attempts, we moved on to trying different map apis that worked through javascript. We had to cut down on the functionalities of our app as time ran out-- instead of matching with a person in your vicinity, you find the places nearest to you that offer free feminine hygiene products through donations-- but we also included a store that gives 25% of all proceeds back,  another way that those who are in good financial standing can help, a series of accounts from women around the world about their period experiences and how it affects them, and some information about our team and how we got started.
