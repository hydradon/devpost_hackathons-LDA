                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a pet is a big commitment. Oftentimes, first time pet owners' expectations don't quite sync with the reality of a pet. In fact, according to a study conducted by Ohio State University, 30% of owners who surrender a dog do so because of lifestyle incompatibilities. CleverPet aims to connect the most compatible dog to an enterprising owner. This way, such incompatilbities can be prevented, helping address the widespread issue of pet homelessness.

                <p>
                    Using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), our app combs through your social media account and consolidates your personality profile. WIth this profile, we will recommend specific dogs that are up for adoption based on how your lifestyle, personality, and the dogs' personality harmonize.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app on Android using Java. Within this aTpplication, we also used Google's API as well as IBM's Waston NLP API. The app ranks the dog based on compatibility with the information gleamed from the machine learning APIs and gives the user the most compatible dog.
