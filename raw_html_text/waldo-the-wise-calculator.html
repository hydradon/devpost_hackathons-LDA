                <p>
                    This calculator has two main features: basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and trigonometric functions (ex. sin, cos, tan, etc.).

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enter "basic math" into the first prompt of the program.
                        </p>

                            Enter either "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide" into the next prompt of the program.
                        </p>

                    How to Use the Trigonometric Feature:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enter "trig" into the first prompt of the program.

                            Enter either "sin", "cos", "tan", "csc", "sec", "cot", "asin", "acos", "atan", "to degrees", or "to radians" into the next prompt. If you are entering either "asin", "acos", or "atan", make sure this value is between -1 and 1 (inclusive), or else you will get an error message telling you that the value you entered is out of the range mentioned above.
                        </p>

                            Enter the value into the next prompt. Please note that this value will be in radians, unless you are entering "asin", "acos", "atan", or "to radians", in which the value will be in units for "asin", "acos", and "atan" or degrees for "to radians".

                    How to Run this Program:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to the Waldo-the-Wise-Calculator! Thank you so much for visiting this repository! Before you run the program, please read the following instructions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To run this program, you must at least have python 3.7.1 installed and a text editor, such as Sublime Text 3.
(link for downloading Sublime Text 3:

                                https://www.sublimetext.com/3
                            </a>
                            )
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Once you have the apps mentioned above, open Command Prompt (for Windows). Make sure you know where you have saved the file containing the code for this program.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Type "cd [location of the file, often located in a folder]" in Command Prompt.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Next, type "cd [specific location of the file within the general folder]" in Command Prompt. If the file is already located in the general folder (from step 3), type in "[name of file].py". Otherwise, type in "[name of file].py" after you have found the specific folder that the file is in.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Follow the prompts from the program when running.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
