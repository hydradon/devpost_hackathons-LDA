                    In our mobile app &ldquo;U Finder&rdquo; for Android, we have stripped the uncertainty of looking for a roommate in college. Whether it be communicating over Facebook or Craigslist, not everyone is always who they advertise to be. We eliminate this risk of false identity by marketing our app towards universities and institutions rather than the students themselves. Within the app the students will register and log in with their university administered email and password, this ensures that they attend the college. Following this, students will complete an intricate personal questionnaire, and then be asked how similar they would like to be to their possible roommate. After their answers have been compared, a scroll of people and the percent they are similar to the user will display. The user can then look through the possible roommates profile answers and choose to contact from there.
We developed the app in Android Studio through Kotlin. This led us to lots of hardships, as no one on the team had ever used either. However coming to this womxnhacks, our goals were to do new and challenging things and this is why we chose to try and make an app. Accomplishments I&rsquo;m proud of my team for doing would be putting so much time and effort into not only making the app work and user friendly, but making it look aesthetically pleasing. From the beginning of this event our team had high expectations and I&rsquo;m proud we were able to hold onto them throughout. I&rsquo;m also exceptionally surprised by how much progress we were able to make using brand new software.
From this event, I&rsquo;ve learned that no project is ever really finished. There is always room for improvement. In the future, our team plans to allocate a couple hours every week to meet over Skype and continue developing our app. Though it was difficult, and touchy at times, building this mobile app through Android Studio was incredibly rewarding at the end.
