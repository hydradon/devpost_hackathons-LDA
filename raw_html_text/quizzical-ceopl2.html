                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that it would be a great project to learn how to work with the Unity gaming environment because it gives us experience with scripting and with UI interaction.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game presents a question to the user with an image and four randomly-ordered options to choose from. Multiple questions make up a round. The game tracks the user's number of correct answers out of the total number of questions answered, and displays their score and their time remaining in the round. When they click an answer to a question, they are presented with the next question. At the end of the game, the user is asked if they would like to play again.
