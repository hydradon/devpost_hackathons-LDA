                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are not hackathons without these two things: ping pong and foosball!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At our last hackathon, we were able to keep pushing forward in the face of bugs and tiredness by playing furious games of ping pong, keeping our blood flowing. Unfortunately, there was no ping pong here. There were tools, however. Tools that those without such grandiose thoughts as ours will not see such potential for. But we saw it. We saw that Oculus and Myo could be combined to form such a fantastic ping pong app that no body could resist it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to do it. Produce the greatest game ever. This is truly the future of games such as ping pong. Those who haven't enough space in their homes can use our Oculus app too play games such as this in the future. This is truly the app most concurrent and parallel with the trends we see in society. With smaller homes and rising prices, VR and AR will be replacing games such as pong.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the heart of the game is Oculus, which is the mediator between the human interface and the computer processor. The
                    <em>
                        rift
                    </em>
                    provides an interface with which we can accomplish fantastic things. We created an astonishing and groundbreaking ping pong app that incorporates motion control and VR to provide a digital environment that one can move about it and play.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this fantastic app by coding without sleep and utilizing Unity3D, Arduino, Oculus, and many other technologies. Viewing our git repo @ [link]

                    will show all of our many failures, successes and iterations.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we were not able to secure either the Myo armband or the Oculus rift, the two cornerstones of our entire project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With perseverance and a bout of luck, we met one who had an Oculus but did not posess the processing power to use it. We were able to secure it from him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next up was the Myo. Initially we were hoping to use this armband as a controller to emulate the holding of a ping pong paddle. Although we could not secure it, our creativity and tenacity allowed us to learn arduino and use the 101 version as a makeshift paddle, as it contains a gyroscope and accelerometer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced many more problems. None of us was exceptionally experience in Unity3D, nor were we well versed in or about C#, Arduino or Oculus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We iterated, conquering one problem after another and gaining momentum until we raced ahead at the pinnacle of speed; ferociously squashing the bugs that fell before us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of each other. We each contributed all that we had and worked in sweat and toiled without sleep for the better part of the weekend. Each of us learned components, abstracting the details of their facet and creating beautiful interfaces for all of us to work with. Then came the app. The first 24 hours were spent in agony; for the majority of it, we did not even have the equipment neccessitated. We persevered and accomplished all and everything we set out to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Oculus, C#, Unity3D and many other technologies. But above all, we learnt that great minds with great goals can accomplish even greater things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for G.G.E.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We allowed many people to play the game. Sponsors, Judges, Co-Hackers and all agreed that it was a fantastic app. Many could not put it down and loved it so much they said we should publish it. Perhaps this is the future for this retro app using tech on the bleeding edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you too all the fantastic sponsors, judges, students, hackers, chefs, volunteers, mentors and all those who contributed to making HackTheNorth a fantastic experience. We truly enjoyed being here and hope to see you all again soon!
