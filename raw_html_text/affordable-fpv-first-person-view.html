                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While looking for ways to enhance my RC aviation experience, I came across "First Person View" tech. It was way too expensive. So I came up with my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using google cardboard and your phone, it made an extremely accessible bundle of technology that is altogether many times less than the current prices of FPV tech.
                </p>
