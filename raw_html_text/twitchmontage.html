                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the way League of Legends highlights are generated instantaneously after a play during Worlds. We wanted to try and make it something available to all Twitch users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The script downloads and analyzes a vod from Twitch, when something exciting happens, it would recognize the spike of chat messages and record that time frame. Then it downloads the top 5 most exciting plays for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a recommendation from a Twitch dev, we started by grabbing the .m3u8 playlist file and the chat log for the vod. Then we started to analyze the logs to find the top 5 highlights. Lastly, we look for these highlights' time frames to download the clips.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Chat history wasn't readily available for us to access through the Twitch API, we did find a way through Rechat. Though there was little documentation for that and we had to spend time looking through the example code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The .m3u8 index file was not accessible through the Twitch API, we tried multiple other methods as workarounds, but none of them helped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chat history file from Rechat was bigger than we anticipated and we had to do some clean up with the data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Using the current tools we have from the Twitch API, we got what was not provided from the API originally.
