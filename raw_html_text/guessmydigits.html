                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team of 2 were already greatly inspired by the various opportunists and challenges in this modern career of computer science. As we started to completely experience what feels like to be at a hackathon we saw the neatest approaches to code, and were in love with the shortcuts of the many of the code we saw.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple IOS application that uses a set arithmetic sequence. While it may seem look pretty straightforward, well that's because it is. It runs on a simple algorithmic formula.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using swift in Xcode (a system that was quite the challenge), and faced many challenges on the way and however, we managed to get most of it done (thanks to the HsHacks Staff).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our very first hackathon was already a bit of a challenge as we observed proficient and master coders in many of the languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud to say we experienced and learned a lot, my team and I attended most of the workshops and asked many questions to the sponsors and the Hshacks team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly focused on learning the swift language by using Xcode, but that didn't really stop us from learning and expanding our knowledge on the various languages. We learned how to use for loops and regular loops, set variables and best of all design a framework for an application.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try our best to continue and complete this IOS application on our own time.
