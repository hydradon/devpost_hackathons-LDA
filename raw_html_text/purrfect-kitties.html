                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app with the Oculus Rift and the Muse. After problems with the Muse, we moved on to something else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it just displays values from the Muse and shows that we can execute triggers from it, but we had two repositories that we were working to put together that we didn't have time to join.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've never used the Muse or programmed Android apps before. One of our team members didn't know much about any particular programming language coming in and another's main language was Python. The cords we were given by the MLH Hardware Lab for the desktop didn't work. The Oculus Rift didn't work for the laptop. Over 4 hours were just spent on that alone. But after those initial hurdles, we were finally able to start hacking.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an app! It's a very rough one. But we did some complicated things and learned so, so much over the course of these 24 hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for Purrfect-Kitties
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the cats! Orginally, our goal was to read brainwaves from the Muse and tell if the user found the current cat picture enjoyable. We were sooooo close, but maybe later we can finish it.
