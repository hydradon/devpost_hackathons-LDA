                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea about the rising concern of the management of our Great Lakes. When I came to MasseyHacks, I was introduced to the many factors that are leading to the wrecking of Lake Erie. I was inspired to use my proficiency in coding to contribute to fixing our Great Lakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always had an inclination to create games, and I was enticed by the hybrid idea of game + dominant issue in society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My idea is to spread awareness of an important issue through an unconventional yet powerful means.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the site with HTML and some CSS, but the majority of the site is a canvas which I used JavaScript with the Paper.js framework to access. I created the vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator CC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the challenge of time, as expected. I spent time trying to implement features (eg. Facebook dialog to share the game), to no avail. Eventually, I had to prioritize my time to create other features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went with my vision without much difficulty. I was able to adapt quickly to Paper.js and although this is my first time working by myself for a hackathon, I pushed through and produced a project I see potential for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the features of Paper.js (managing symbols, layers, importing/exporting images, etc.) because my project is essentially based on Paper.js.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps most importantly, I learned a lot about the situation of our Great Lakes. The research I did for the mission often shocked me, due to how unaware I was.
                </p>

                    24 hours is certainly not enough for me to complete the vision I have in mind. Here's a to-do list:
