                <p>
                    This program creates a Fourier Transform of the commits over time data from a given repository. The resulting figure that you see below is a intensity versus frequency graph of that data. It is generated by binning 100,000 data points into intervals of 1 hour. It should be noted that this graph does not show user-specific visits, and therefore does not predict the number of programmers committing at a certain frequency. Rather, it shows us the frequency of the events that draw significantly more (or less) commits. For example, a spike at the one month frequency does not mean that there are many once-a-month committers, but instead that there is some external factor that attracts more commits each month.
