                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As museums all around the country need several guides for showing various artifacts to visitors. It costs museum organization to spend a lot of money on guides. So we have decided to solve this issue by creating an unified app for all the museum around the country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the web-app we scan the qr-code for each artifact. And by scanning these qrcode the visitor will get the information about the artifacts, so this web-app eliminates the need of guide and along with that it reads out that information about artifact and one more thing, we have added the use of AR to show 3D images of artifacts.
                </p>
