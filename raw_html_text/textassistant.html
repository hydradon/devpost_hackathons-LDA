                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our personal experiences with language barriers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The widget allows the user to select a language and speak in order to generate a text message in the selected language. The user will then be prompted to select their favorite messaging app and the contact to send the message to. It is that easy!  On top of that, if you use the app as opposed to the widget, you have the opportunity to edit what the phone heard you say and see the translation update in real time, then choose an app and recipient for the message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android's built-in text-to-speech capabilities and the google cloud API in order to understand and translate the user's message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we intended to include a video call capability, where the user could call another person using our app and have the other person's speech translated into their preferred language (as a subtitle). We planned on using the Twilio API for this functionality, but ran into setup issues for video and voice transmission.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Successfully creating an overlay that can interact with other messaging apps
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even if we did not fulfill all of the functionality that we had wanted to implement, our plan allowed us to break it into parts so that we are still able to present a successful project that we are proud of

                        Android studio is not always the most cooperative software...

                        Google APIs are incredibly powerful and are very easy to integrate into android apps
