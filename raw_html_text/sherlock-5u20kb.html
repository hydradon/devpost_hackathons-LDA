                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by brainstorming around the topic of "Smart home." We were originally inspired by seeking to optimize a user's experience in the most widely used area of the home: the kitchen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through face recognition, we identify key features from the user in front of the camera, which ideally would be attached on the appliance. We then customize the response of the appliance to cater to that specific case. For example, one use case is that of allowing a medicine cabinet, say, to be "sherLocked" by having our system issue a warning if the face attempting to use it is too young.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the facial recognition api from IBM cloud and the laptop's webcam. The main UI is a website built in HTML hosted on github. We also tried to incorporate the Bose soundtouch system to issue audible responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing different APIs. Getting the right tools (ie. speaker)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the webcam and everything hooked up. Having a working UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SherLock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's so much room for expansion! This is only one use case that's barely fleshed out, but there could be many many more.
