                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication restrictions can be incredibly limiting. One of the mentors we met gave us the idea to look into LoRa technology, which became part of our final design.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes LoRa transmitters paired with Wi-Fi repeaters to transmit text messages over large distances. The repeaters are deployed via drone.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our conceptual design was put together using our knowledge of communication systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult at first to come to a consensus about what project to do and how to approach the design challenge. After aligning ourselves with a single issue we were able to put our design together successfully.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to optimize our time spent on given tasks. We also learned about LoRa transmissions, drone payloads, and web app development.
