                    Have you ever walked by a lost dog poster...

                    I have, and I want to help but in reality, it is very unlikely. With this app, anyone that has a camera and internet access can help a lost dog. All you would need to do is take a photo of the dog, upload it, and tag the location where the photo was taken. The photo will be processed by a classification model to determine its breed and will be stored in our database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the flipside, if you've lost your dog and would like the support of your community in your search, all you would need to do is submit a photo of your dog to our website. Like before, it will classify its breed, but now it will search our database for the same breed within the same area. It gives dog owners another mean of locating their loved one.
