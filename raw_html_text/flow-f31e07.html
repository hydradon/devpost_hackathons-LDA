                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always annoying to spend valuable time walking to a study area only to find that it is packed, and not being able to get any work done. We built this to fix this problem as easily and conveniently as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays information about the number of people around the monitoring node. We then are able to graph this data over time, giving the user an idea about the busyness around the node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a laptop wifi card to count the nearby MAC Addresses. The data is then sent to a database to keep track of the number of devices in a certain area over time. The web and mobile apps (made in Flutter IO using dart) then query this database.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Device drivers. Monitoring mode for Wi-Fi cards.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beautiful graphs on both mobile and web. Fully automated packet capture. Completely cross-platform.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You need to parse Strings as ints to graph them. Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart.

                    What's next for Flow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding several monitoring modes across campus to get an idea of the Flow of people through the university. Collecting this type of data would allow us to start making predictions about the behaviour of people. This would allow us to get information such as the most frequented places on campus, and the quietest place to study.
