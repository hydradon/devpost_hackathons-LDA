                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wakefern's challenge inspired us to create Change for Change. We considered how to optimize the in-store shopping experience while also strengthening the communities that Wakefern's stores are central to. The future of "grocery for good," we decided, lied in an easy-to-use, versatile, user-friendly donation app. With that, Change for Change was born: "paying it forward" for the modern user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Change for Change is a web app that allows for customers to "pay it forward" by donating a small fee to cover the cost of groceries for local families in need. Users are first brought to a homepage that describes Change for Change's mission and gives them several donation amount options to choose. Upon clicking an option, users can enter their financial information and make a payment to Change for Change, which is listed as a business bank account for the grocery store. These funds are deducted from the bill of families in need, using technology to optimize donating while uniting communities with kindness.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end was built using Flask. The front end was built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We used Google Firebase to store the email addresses and we used Stripe Checkpoint to facilitate donations/transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is still relatively new to web development. We ran into obstacles while trying to write new data into the database as well as some issues with debugging JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is essential, asking for help is a part of learning, and caffeinated chocolate is a very good friend to have at a 24-hour event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Change for Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the app to a variety of stores as well as include other features in the app including pages for coupons and events.
