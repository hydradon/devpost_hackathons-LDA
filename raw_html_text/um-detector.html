                    This is an audio classifier which would detect when a speaker says a filler word, such as "um". Model architecture, dataset, etc. is described below:

                    in this case, there is a pretrained model available, so going off of that immediately could be very convenient. However, given the model architecture, It might be difficult to run in real time. It's also trained for categorizing different types of sounds in general rather than human speech, so not sure how quickly transferable.

                    the requirement here is an unscript, labeled dataset containing filler words such as um. 
I've thought about using google's or microsoft api to label some audio, but those models sometimes actively ignore filler words. That makes some sense from a design decision, but is entirely useless here.

                    In this case, we're interested in the filler instances. After filtering for that, There are a total of 2988 instances of filler moments in this dataset. Not a whole lot to be training on, but this is the only dataset I was able to find that I could actually access.

                        not including the laugh parts at all so that the final dataset would be balanced ish instead of there being significantly more of non-filler moments. It's still not totally balanced, but that's probably okay. Reflective of actual testing distribution and whatever.

                    It's actually not at all balanced........ note to self: try undersampling the not um's if the initial model doesn't work

                    so at this point it's late at night and I realize that the checkpoint file cannot automatically accommodate the change in input and output vectors (ie. input is now 2000ms, output is now just a couple of classes)

                    last minute retraining of the base model. Adjusted unknown_percentage to 50 since there's only a single other class. starts right away with 50% accuracy, with makes sense as there's only 2 options. Converged somewhat at only 1.6k steps when I stopped it in order to train my actual um model. The lack of reliable validation data is really hurting right now as there isn't really a way to check for overfitting and not enough time to write something up as I still haven't finished figuring out how to get the model to predict on a real time audio stream

                    this incredibly messed up graph is the training result. The bit at the start was when I started, then restarted a training run, but couldn't be bothered to remove it. The base model trained for 1.5k steps before switching over to using the um dataset. Later on, I forgot to turn off the training run and I really hope it didn't overfit too badly, but again, validation isn't working. The fact that the model is converging so quickly might be worrying or it might just be because there are so few classes. And data. There isn't enough data.

                    This section is where I spent both not enough time and at the same time, too much time. The planned demo involved a real time beep as the speaker says a filler word (ie. um). The only inference that's really working is reading 2 second wav files and giving you a result, so that's what the demo will be. I'll add the ability to speak into the speaker, and save a bunch of wav files into a folder, which would be sent for inference.

                        CNN is fine for this use case since I'm only detecting specific sounds. If I want to incorporate other filler words that are actually in use in normal english, such as "like", I'll probably have to do something with recurrent networks or similar so that the model will be able to take into account that time dependency
