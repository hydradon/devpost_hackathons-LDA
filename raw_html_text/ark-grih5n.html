                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the civilian outreach that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. Rescuers in their own boats were scanning social media outlets for locations of people who needed rescuing from the flood waters. This was inefficient and needlessly endangered lives. Ark efficiently connects rescue victims and rescuers in one system. Intelligently dispatching rescuers to victims.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A victim in an emergency situation can send a request to the system using their iPhone. The system will then look for the best match of rescuer and dispatch them to their location. The victim will be updated showing their location and the rescuer coming to get them, as well as the rescuers distance and estimated travel time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the backend in Django. The backend will receive a victim's request (sent from the user's phone over the net) it will then process the request and dispatch a rescuer, sending back the appropriate data to be displayed to the user. The backend site also serves as a "Command Post"  showing all active victim and rescuer locations.
