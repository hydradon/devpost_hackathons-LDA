                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team formation at hackathons is always tough. As a hackathon organizer last year, I knew the struggle of trying to help foster team making at them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web app that allows users to sign up and create a profile where they can list their skills (and organize them based on skill level) and interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. The back end uses SQL to store the form queries, flask and python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of how to determine who to match people up with based on the skills they specified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a web app that we believe will be helpful in fostering connections between hackers and for the future of how hackathons do team forming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about creating a database that connects to a web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hacksociety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on integrating more APIs (like MLH's to import a steady list source of hackathons happening) and utilizing it at BostonHacks.
