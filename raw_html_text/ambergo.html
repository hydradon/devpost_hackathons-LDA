                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought of this idea of "imagine if there was a Pokemon GO for Amber Alerts", and as I waited for my taco bell realized that many of the elements in an ARG game such as Pokemon GO or Ingress can be applied to other real world scenarios, but with a less colorful coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Pokemon go and Ingress, you have live events, and are given incentives for relocating to places of interest, such as public parks. In AmberGO, the live event is an amber alert, and the places of interest are a list of gas stations. Based on the kidnapper's car make and model, we can determine how far they can get on a full tank before refueling. Therefore, the kidnapper MUST stop at one of these stations at some point between the incident and any attempt to leave AmberGO's depicted search radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask templates to have the reporter enter the car info needed and last known location in order to determine how far the kdinapper can get away. The car data images are scraped from a car website, while the location data is managed via the Google Maps javascript API, as well as the  Google Places Javascript API, and the Google Geocoder API.
                </p>
