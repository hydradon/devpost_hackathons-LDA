                <p>
                    This summer, after work one day, my friends car battery had died. Neither of us knew how to jumpstart a car and had to call my dad for help. We had the tools, but we didn't have the knowledge.
                </p>

                    This app provides information about symbols on the dashboard, who to contact when in need of help based on location, and will soon include games that walk the user through basic vehicle repairs such as changing a tire or jumpstarting a car.
