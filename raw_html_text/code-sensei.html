                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ideea came from Diner, who worked with learnig materials platforms before.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webapp will have a short discussion with the user, who can state if he wants to learn about a certain programming language, or if he wans examples, or it can ask for a coding challange.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The JavaScript front-end calls the LUIS API in order to process the natural language. After that it intercepts the resulted JSON file and it parses it and makes the relevant calls to the C# controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The novelty of the API made it quite a challange to harness all it's power.
The server handles often resulted in bad gateways.
Recognising short answers out of context (i.e. ~What difficulty level would you be interested in? ~Intermediate.)
And many many more.
