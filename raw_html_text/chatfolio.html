                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a way to allow users to conversationally be able to manage their stock portfolios, sort of like a virtual stockbroker. Additionally, for more advanced users, I would like it to display in-depth analysis of their portfolios.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It parses a message the user sends for key phrases, and then performs various actions such as displaying the details of a portfolio depending on what the user wants.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Microsoft Cognitive Services Text Analytics API to parse a user message for key phrases, and then used the key phrases to determine the appropriate response. I used the the BlackRock Aladdin API to get details about my portfolio, which can be extended

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started working on my project rather late, and it was difficult to figure out how to get the display exactly how I wanted it.

                <p>
                    The solo integration of multiple APIs.

                    How to use APIs, so that next time it'll be faster

                    What's next for ChatFolio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more responses to possible user messages (in particular displaying potential stocks and other performance measurements of the portfolio), implementing speech to text integration to allow users to interact with the chat bot through audio. I would like to run machine learning algorithms on news from websites like seekingalpha, motley fool, or google finance news to determine the sentiment toward various stocks which would tell me which stocks are going to perform well. An extension would be to determine how the sentiment toward a stock correlates to the stock's performance for that day/month.
