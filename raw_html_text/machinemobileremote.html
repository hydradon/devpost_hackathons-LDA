                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bobst Challenge was to use our creativity developing some original actions to activate and give commands to its cool machine.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal is to create an iOS application and use iPhone's Motion Detection to control the machine. First step is to log in, because only authorized people can control it, so a FaceId recognition is used. Then, a set of concrete actions, as feed and empty a queue, speed up and down velocity, fix or reset can be reproduced with the mobile phone and are recognized and executed by the machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An image with the indications of each movement is attached in the final part of this post, in order to facilitate the comprehension to the user.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift to create the code of the app and then I decided which movements to do and its associated machine actions.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I noticed that the most difficult movements where when moving thought z-axis because of negative angles.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, the project is really innovative because the machine can be controlled without the necessity to be present in the same place where its placed.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My idea was to do a iOS app because it was my first time in this field (and also in a Hacketon) so every second of this day had been a challenge for me. Also, I learnt the cooperation of people who helps you when you need.

                    It has a lot to improve, starting for the app style and so on.
