                    In its current state, GOLD is not well-equipped to plan future schedules; because of its inability to group and show a weekly view for potential future classes, UCSB students are forced to use auxiliary tools like Google Calendar or traditional calendars to plan schedules. Our webapp, NotGaucho.Space, rectifies this issue by using the UCSB API to retrieve course information and place it into a weekly calendar view. Our name was inspired by another UCSB site, GauchoSpace.ucsb.edu.

                    Over the course of this project's development, our team learned a lot about JavaScript, React, UCSB's API, DevExtreme's ReactScheduler, and patience. We gained a major appreciation for Git as we struggled to merge each members' competing histories.

                    Our collective lack of experience with React slowed our development and introduced potentially unnecessary bugs (features). As well, our ambitions presented a challenge as we were forced to pare down our ideas to something we could develop within the course of 36 hours.

                    In sum, our group gained tangible experience with several technologies, namely React, and gained a better understanding of the process of software development. In future support of our app, we intend to polish up our styling to make the app more visually appealing and concordant with UCSB's graphic palette. As well, we intend to tie up some notable edge cases and improve the visual continuity of our features, namely our GE Finder feature, by placing every component on a single page.
