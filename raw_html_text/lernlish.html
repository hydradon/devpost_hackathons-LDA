                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were discussing our ideas for the project, we started listening to the sound that we hear daily. We thought of a launchpad idea where users can use different sounds of objects to create their launchpad. However, we decided to change the target audience of the project and help babies learn words by listening to the sounds that things make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three categories: animals, transportation, and instruments. There are multiple items in each category. If you click the button, it will make a sound of the object and repeat the name after the sound. This repetition will help babies learn new words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native to create the front-end of the app. First, we designed the user interface and designed the screens and functions that the app would have. Next, we divided the work equally and started coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native was a new programming language for most of our group mates. We didn't download all the necessary tools before the hackathon, and we couldn't download some of the tools. We could only work with a laptop to actually test the app. Even with that laptop, we couldn't download an android simulator, so we worked on Expo Snack instead of Expo Cli. Formatting the app was one of the hardest challenges that we faced. We couldn't figure out 'Stylesheet' from React Native; we spent a good amount of time learning it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually created the main screen, the introduction screen, and created screens for each category. We created buttons and formatted them in a pretty way. We are impressed of coming up with an idea and creating a prototype in less than 24 hours. We are proud that we can create an app that can help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new language and how to create an app with that language. We found a great potential in the app and how it can help people in a positive way. We learned how to communicate with our team members and work together to realize our ideas. The workshops helped us understand how machine learning works and how to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for lernlish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to add the sound effect, add pictures, and add more words in each category. We didn't have enough time to finish the app, but this is a great starting point of the app. With more time, this app can help babies learn words and create some bonding time between the parents and the babies. We will design the app prettier with pictures and warm colors.
