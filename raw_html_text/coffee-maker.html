                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once I tried to make coffee for my guest and I was unable to make it. So I searched for skill but was unable to find it. Therefore I build this simple and awesome skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's Simple. This skill knows how to make four types of Coffee without a coffee maker. The list is basic Instant, Latte, Shake and Cold Coffee. So go ahead Enjoy your coffee and if you like please rate us at the store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it using python and aws as hosting service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To integrate apl documents into the skill was quite challenging for me since I was working with python and it is in its beta version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After failing two-three times for skill certification, I was proud to present my first multimodal skill for the alexa store.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time to host my skill on aws, but I found it quite simple and user-friendly. Learning about APL Rendering was quite interesting too.
