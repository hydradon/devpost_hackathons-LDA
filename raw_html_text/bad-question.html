                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of passionate learners that are excited about creating stories for people. Though most of our work goes unnoticed we thought it would be awesome to have others experience going through an amazing story and having their own impact onto a story!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you come to the site, you are able to see a set of stories. You will be able to select a story and begin your path. When you get through the first page, you will have to make choice (sounds like real life) and each has its own consequence &amp; reward. And eventually you will come to the point where no more content exists and then you get to write in your own portion to the story! It will allow for uploaded illustrative content so you can have a custom background to the story.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built all in Ruby on Rails! The team went through the entire ideation stage it was fantastic. We have several diagrams and flowcharts describing how the application would look before we even started writing code which made a lot of the work very simple.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    One of the challenges that Maxcell ran into was setting up Rails because two gems were so problematic to install

                    Ruby can be a fickle.
