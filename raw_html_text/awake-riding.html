                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our group members have experience falling asleep on public transit which cause us to miss our stop
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the Google map Api, this app will take a destination and type of commute as input, then getting JSON data back from Google&rsquo;s Api. Those data will help us interact with our smartphone. 
The Awake Riding plugin sends an alert notification( to the user&rsquo;s phone when the user getting close to your stop. It will keep alerting the user until they notice the alert to make sure they get off at the right destination.
For walking or biking user, the Awake Riding will alert them with vibration when they getting to the destination really close. No one wants to hold the smart phone and keep checking it all the time. The vibration alerts will get stronger the closer the user is to their situation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the back end of the plugin created
The backend&rsquo;s job is to take coordinate or arriving time and do a comparison with the destination then return a JSON back to the frontend. 
On the public transit mode, the backend will compare the current time with the expecting time to the destination stop, then trigger the alarm  3 minutes before their stop.
On the walking or biking mode, the backend will compare the distance between the destination and trigger the alarm when is getting close enough
                </p>
