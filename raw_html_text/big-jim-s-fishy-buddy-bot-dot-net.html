                    of _ Big Jim's Tire Tread Utopia _ happened upon a great and magical goldfish wearing a bucket hat. Now you see, ** Big Jim** had been going through some rather harsh times lately, and he was in mighty desperate need of a friend. Nothing particular special, just someone he could bounce some thoughts back and forth with once and a while.

                    lived a lonely life, being the absolute ruler of the _ Big Jim's Tire Tread Utopia _ empire and all. And at the time, it seemed as though this squishy fishy would do just the trick.

                    took that fateful evening when he happened upon this peculiar piscine pal: it was the actual incarnation of the inevitable tragedy of attempting to find happiness and meaning in our insignificant and miserable lives, no matter how chunky its cheeks and gurgly its gills appeared. For every mere interaction of good faith held with this poor bubbly bastard, the world would be forced further into its destruction, frequently through planetary obliteration for the sake of cosmic threat, widespread epidemics in children's hospitals, DDoSing sites of cute animal pictures, and genocide of the masses through cult-like charisma if need be (don't talk about this with

                    But wait, what about those calamities heralding the end of days, you probably don't ask?! Well, for every moment longer you spend interacting with Fishy Buddy, a ping is sent back that signals biofeedback to reduce and/or negate destructive urges naturally instigated within Fishy Buddy, thus immediately offsetting those dangerous effects, as well as helping to train Fishy Buddy's delicate and sensitive body to treat yours much better. The good feelies go both ways, in a very special way to make everyone feel good. But be sure not to hog up too much time, because too much interaction may lead to too frequent feedback, and subsequent temporary shutdown of Fishy Buddy. uwu

                    NOTE: There are at least some somewhat serious plans to use the site as a testing grounds for further chatbot builds in the future. Our team did work on a chatbot type of project for the primary project focus (temporarily at

                    ), although this particular aspect is for the domain category and some future plans we couldn't get to in time. The associated background is mostly just for fun and mildly related to some ideas tossed around about other simpler chatbot ideas that could be of use (in particular what had been in mind was something to talk to and get resources from for those in an unsafe state of mind, including with depressive/suicidal states of thoughts, in things such as online server chatrooms or through voluntary exposure, etc).
