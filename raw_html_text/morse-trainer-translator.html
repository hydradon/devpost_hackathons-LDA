                    It can show any text on its display and at the same time emit it in morse on the yellow LED and while the red button is pressed emit it as sound as well. 
If the yellow button is used to switch from output to input mode the program will start recording user input as morse code from the blue button (press short/long for dit/dash, pause for pause).
This input will be saved and displayed by display/LED/sound once the user switches back to input mode through the yellow button.

                    In case of a crisis, when emergency communication needs to be established, morse code is often chosen for its simplicity. But only few people today know the concept, how to read and how to generate it. This wants to give you a chance to learn or translate.
