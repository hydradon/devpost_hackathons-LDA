                    I've been fiddling around with tensorflow for a while now. I got it to work and trained a simple neural network. It's not much to look at, but it can tell a pet from a car with 99% accuracy.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I build this by installing tensorflow and training one of the sample networks on datasets of pictures of cars and of pets (cats and dogs in this case)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Lord Almighty tensorflow did not want to work on my computer. I had to install it like three different times to get it to even output a test and the documentation is not very accessible to a beginner.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am most proud of the fact that I got it to work. I put data into a convolutional neural network and it puts out answers just like that. It's a thing of beauty.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I've learned a little about machine learning and a lot about python. I didn't end up going with it, but I figured out a way to apply convolutional maps to images by the hundreds. It's like ten lines in python. Amazing. Also I figured out a way to include my cat in my project, so mission accomplished.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I want to break the whole thing down and build my own neural network from the ground up. I'll do it to, in the fullness of time.
