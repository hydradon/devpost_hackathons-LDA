                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applying to one job can be time-consuming, applying to ten can consume a life. When attempting to manage multiple job applications, the process can become extremely disorganized. This is compounded when trying to remember which recruiters were for what jobs and who has been recently contacted. During our personal internship/job search, we were forced to use excel sheets or even pen and paper to maintain organization. For this reason, we decided to build Jobminder a job application organizer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jobminder starts by having the user find job postings of interest to them. At this point the user has to manually upload the jobs they plan to apply for, in the future we hope to add job postings website APIs. Once a user has a saved job that they are planning to apply to they then add contacts that are relevant to the position. This could be recruiters met at hackathons, friends who work for the company, or anyone associated with the company. At this point, users have to use their phone book or manually enter contacts, in the future we would like to integrate the ability to use LinkedIn&rsquo;s connections. The user is then able to update the application as they move from prospecting the job to actually applying, getting the interview, then receiving an offer; all the while, having easy access to their network within the company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Ionic framework to build an Angular JS web application that can be ported to IOS and Android. We built a RESTful Node.js API using Express and mongodb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The big job posting websites (LinkedIn, Monster, etc.) require developers to file applications and wait on average a week to gain the API keys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our user authentication! Two of our team members are experienced programmers and this was the first time using ionic and MongoDB. The other two team members are inexperienced programmers and were able to learn a lot about the process of designing a web app from the ground-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud to learn how to use Ionic. This allowed us to port our web application written in angular.js to both an android and iOS app. This was the first time that our team worked together on a project; SpartaHack is the reason for our newfound friendship! During this weekend, we were able to determine what each of our strengths are and determine how to manage ourselves accordingly. We needed this group cohesion when it came to prioritizing which features we wanted to build with the time constraints of this event. The group members with little programming experience learned much about the set-up that is required to build any functional application. Overall, we all learned new skills and how to function as a team to accomplish a common goal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jobminder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just because SpartaHack is concluding does not mean our work is done. Over the next month, we plan to gain access to LinkedIn&rsquo;s API. This will give us access to around 77% of all job postings. This data will substitute users having to enter in job postings manually. We will also incorporate USAJobs API to include many jobs relevant to US veterans and assist them with their job search after deployments. With LinkedIn&rsquo;s API, we will give users access to their LinkedIn connections improve the networking aspect of the job search. We will also add push notification when the user switches the status of their saved jobs. This will remind users to reach out to their contacts at jobs that they are applying/interviewing it.
