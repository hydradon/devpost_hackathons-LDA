                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give people of communities more of a voice and areas less fortunate a louder one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A community comes together on an idea this platform gives them a voice to say "Hey, we'd really love this built in our city". They submit a form, it goes through a voting system and then based upon its popularity it well then go and be approved by the board, after approval funding will take place and once funding is complete it is then to be built!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built for demo purposes using html5, css3, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this Hackathon, we had a few ideas we couldn't come together on solely one and that took us the most time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for City Fund
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make it functional! The current version just sits as a demo for now but we're looking to bring our team back in to work through the kinks. Further down the line, we're planning on working with municipal leaders to make our goal of funding community projects a real thing!
