                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn  how to utilize drone-based robotics and integrate the mechanical component of the project with our Machine Learning knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Viewers can give commands to fly a drone which capture image and identifies objects in said image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the ar-drone control modules along with the API for Twitch chat and then tensorflow for image identification
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drone ran out of battery, I.E. limited testing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This drone can identify anything in image net. Running three separate scripts that communicate with each other simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about servers and sockets, Also that many people playing twitch chaotically is very fun with a somewhat dangerous machine.
                </p>
