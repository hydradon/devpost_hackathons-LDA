                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As financial illiteracy is becoming more and more prevalent, we want to help finance our youth&rsquo;s futures by teaching them budgeting and planning skills at a young age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Funance is a simulator game app that follows the life of a person who starts out with low financial knowledge. Users must use their quick thinking and learning skills to get through their character&rsquo;s life while gaining income and interest, facing obstacles, and handling opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using the Thunkable platform and its variety of components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to work with local data in the app. The different screens would not interact the way they were coded to. Another challenge that we ran into was that Thunkable did not allow user collaboration, so we had to work on it one by one at different times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment that we&rsquo;re the most proud of is that we managed to make something with our limited devices and platforms. In addition, we are proud of our project idea and we believe that it is something we can greatly improve in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In creating this app, we learned much more about financial knowledge and the financial literacy of children, teens, and adults in the U.S. Additionally, we learned to adjust to the conditions we had and work the best we were able to. In the future, we would make sure to completely verify that we brought working devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Funance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add much more to the app, including insurance, real estate, bank CD, mutual funds, compounding, Web DB components, and user account information. We also want to use a more user friendly platform to build the app, like Python or Unity, since we were unable to at the hackathon (as the devices were all limited in capability). The next step would definitely be to upload the app to the App Store for Apple devices and Play Store for Android.
