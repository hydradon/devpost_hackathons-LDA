                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out of many of the popular social mediums our society uses today, Twitter has always been the most enigmatic. While Facebook connects us with friends and family and Instagram lets us satisfy our innate narcissistic human tendencies (a.k.a. selfies), Twitter's purpose often remains elusive. Advertisements, the bane of our mortal existence, do not provide Twitter with nearly enough revenue as they would need to progress in our capitalist nation. The most obvious issue, which we believe Twitter has not yet addressed, is its severe lack of active users&ndash;&ndash;why does Facebook have billions of users while Twitter barely has a few hundred million? We surveyed many people at this hackathon to discover their reasoning for using&ndash;or not using&ndash;Twitter and found that it lacks organization. "It's just a massive information dump that would take forever to sort through to find all the relevant pieces," and "It's too confusing for new users to bother trying to learn how to use it."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our website organizes tweets based on certain keywords. You can add and remove keywords to your feed to narrow down or widen what you want to see. People with and without accounts can use our site, and would only need an account if they wanted to contribute by tweeting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built in Python and Flask, and the frontend was built with Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add a bunch of cool features that integrated data analytics with social media, but we realized that our goal was to create a user-oriented product instead. A lot of our time was spent going to data-related workshops to understand the purpose of open-source information in our project. Any time we were stuck on something, we went and spoke to everyone that we could find and pitch our ideas&ndash;we needed help narrowing them down to direct our product to a certain audience (non-Twitter users).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team after just meeting each other when the hackathon began.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use the IBM Watson Concept Expansion API as well as the Twitter Search API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Make Twitter Great Again
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will attempt to continue making our tool as integrative as possible, as not to disrupt our users' lives with technology, but rather improve it. Using big data and data analytics, we will be able to create compelling visualizations that will appeal to the users while also providing them with valuable insight on their social networking and the world around them.
