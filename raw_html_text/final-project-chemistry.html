                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted a program to give me answers to my chemistry homework. For my final project in my computer science class, I am building a package that will do just that, saving me time on homework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far it can index chemicals and get their weight as well as add two together to get their weight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The parser looks like this:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-python"><code>def __init__(self):
                                self.symbols = []
        self.masses = []
        self.chemicals = {}
        response = requests.get('https://www.ptable.com/') #get data with an http request
        html_doc = response.text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "html.parser")
        for e in soup.select('tbody td'):
        p = e.find('acronym')
        if p != None:
        if p.text != "Symbol" and p.text not in self.symbols:
        self.symbols.append(p.text)
        for mass in soup.select('tbody td'):
        mass = mass.find('i')
        if mass != None:
        if mass.text != "Weight":
        number = mass.text
        if "(" in mass.text and ")" in mass.text:
        number = mass.text[1:-1]
        self.masses.append(number)
        idx = 0
        for element in self.symbols:
        self.chemicals[element] = self.masses[idx]
        idx += 1
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was not comfortable in CSS or BeautifulSoup so I really had to push myself to try and parse the information that I needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can now find elements and their weight and am starting a scientific calculator. It was very difficult for me, but I ultimately succeeded in the hardest part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That ultamitely, the hard work pays off and once you get through the hardest part, it's all smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for final-project-chemistry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on expanding it to work with compounds and balancing equations. This project was started recently so I am trying my best to get everything done.
