                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3 years ago Terra0.org was a master-project by two design students in Berlin, introducing self-sovereign forests.  Started a conversation on Nature2.0, and has kept me noodling on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this Thursday, a Brasilian friends grandmom was taken to hospital for breathing problems in Sao Paolo, caused by the thick smoke from the intense forest fires across latin-America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was first considering a Uniswap-project; then realised that we can issue nature-backed money;
                </p>
                <h1>
                    TreeSwap.  Like uniswap, but for (growing) Trees.
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It issues 3 trillion
                    <code>
                        unTree
                    </code>
                    (debt-based) tokens, at a starting price of 0.1 ETH/unTree.  After initial bootstrap it relies on uniswap unTree/ETH exchange on-chain to set the price point for further debt-issuance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An
                    <code>
                        unTree
                    </code>
                    represents one tree in the real-world that must be grown, for climate change to remain under 430 CO2ppm (or 2 degrees); therefore the collateral paid in ETH, is
                    <em>
                        not
                    </em>
                    stored in the Terra6 contract; it is forwarded directly to a
                    <code>
                        reforestationDAO
                    </code>
                    (not built) that accepts proposals for spending this revenue, solely on
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        reforestation,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        preservation,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        monitoring projects for forests, worldwide
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The unTree token is in turn required when anyone wants to pay off their externalities (CO2 emissions); they can do so by paying in ETH (collateral for additional funding of forest projects) and a fee in unTree tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In return the user gets a non-transferable
                    <code>
                        HERO
                    </code>
                    status.  Companies and individuals can come to desire/(socially) require to have high enough status.
                    <code>
                        HERO
                    </code>
                    status however is bought on a bonding curve, and becomes more expensive as more
                    <code>
                        unTree
                    </code>
                    debt is recollected, and growth of trees has been funded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    --&gt; it is better to pay of your externalities today, than tomorrow if we want to start reversing the climate catastrophe.
                </p>

                    As Terra6 issues the goal of 3 trillion
                    <code>
                        unTree
                    </code>
                    debt tokens, it linearly reduces the amount of debt it issues, and instead issues
                    <code>
                        Tree
                    </code>
                    tokens which represent a right to a proportional earning of Terra6 s monthly externalities-earnings (revenue sharing not built).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By failing countless of times, and reducing the proposal time and time again to it's simplest form.  Initially it composed of asset issuing (trees and untrees), proposal funding, and reality-attestations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being crazy enough to want to build anything like this over a hackathon weekend.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I built something :-P

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a lot about all existing DAO mechanisms; forking them, extending them; breaking them :-D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Terra6
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing it; cadCAD for actual dynamical simulations of the incentive dynamics -- does it do it's job of issuing $60 trillion USD in debt, to replant the missing 3 trillion trees on Earth ?  -- in time?
