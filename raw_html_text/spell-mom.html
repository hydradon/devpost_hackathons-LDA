                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I see my wife sitting with my Son everyday asking him set of spellings and making sure he remembers and spells out correctly. I wondered why can't Alexa do the same? Especially for those kids who are visually challenged, learning difficulty, blind, non-motivated or working parents who constantly busy. This inspired me to design and develop this Alexa Spell Mom skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Spell Mom is a simple Alexa skill for children to practice their spellings on a daily basis in a fun and entertainment manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kids interact with Alexa on a regular basis stepping up the levels as they learn. Based on the learning feedback, Alexa improvises the learning scheme so kids learn effectively. Intelligence is built into the skill so skill will tune the kids abilities and generalises across the group based on geographic and demographic variables. It also awards and rewards kids.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Learning the Alexa
2) Making sure the kids conversations are correctly identified
3) Making sure the lessons are fun and engaging
4) Building awards and rewards
5) Creating various levels of learning schemes
6) Wide variance in demographics, geo locations, schools and syllabi.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially it was implemented for kids to engage and learn spellings in an interactive and effective way, later I realised the skill has a greater potential to be used by visually challenged, blind and kids with learning difficulties.
                </p>

                    Not just Alexa skill but a wide variety of skills - problem analysis, skill development, marketing and others.
