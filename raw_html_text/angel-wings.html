                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More people are trying to use the bicycle to go at work and also in the free time, this is the reason why they need an angel to protect them on the road. We identified some of the causes for the accidents where the bikers are involved and the root cause is the intent of changing the direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This equipment will help the biker to be SEEN on the traffic, basically he will have a vest with lights that will light if he want to turn left or right and also if something unexpected appear and he needs to stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will use Arduino and an equipment made out of a pair of gloves with sensors and a vest with lights. The gloves will identify the intention of stopping or signaling of the bicyclist with the help of the sensors and will send messages to the vest which will light up.
                </p>
