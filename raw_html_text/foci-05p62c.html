                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will run a test at a location to determine whether the location is a quiet place or not and the brightness of the location. The user can then use this information to determine if he/she would prefer that type of location. For an example, if the user is a student he may prefer a quiet and brightly lit area because those two main factors help with concentration. The app will run a test to determine if the location is adequate for the student's need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to code the tests that the app runs. To code the audio test we recorded the environment for over a period of time and then we analyzed the decibel levels that we got from the voice recording. If the decibel level was below 60 then the environment is quiet, if it is between 60 to 70 decibels then the environment is moderately loud, and if it is greater than 70 decibels then the environment is too loud. For brightness we got the value of the the screen's brightness because the screen's brightness is adjusted automatically based on the environment's lighting. The value of the screen's brightness is between 0-100. If the value of the screen's brightness is below 25 then the location is not optimally lit. If the value is between 25 and 50 then the location is moderately lit and if the screen brightness is above 50 then the room is optimally lit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest challenge we ran into was trying to make the test. Converting the voice recording to decibel units was the hardest part.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of getting the maps and current location to show up on our app. The iOS SDK does not allow the programmer to access system values, so we had to use other methods to get some of the values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the iOS SDK and various commands in the Swift programming language. We learned that iOS protects most of their settings so we had to be creative and think outside the box to get system values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foci
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to add in a review system where the user at a location can rate the location.
