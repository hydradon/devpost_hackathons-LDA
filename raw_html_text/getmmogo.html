                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for getmm&ocirc;g&ocirc; is to establish connections and build closer communities, regardless of distance. Mm&ocirc;g&ocirc; is the Setswana word for
                    <em>
                        together
                    </em>
                    , to emphasize that we want our users to come together to form one large community with themselves and nature. To promote the general well being of the whole community, we thought that the best way was to share information on conservation and sustainability, easily. With relatively low internet access and rising cellphone use, offline information sharing seemed to be the best route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    getmm&ocirc;g&ocirc; allows users to write their own articles and share them even if they are offline. When a user has an internet connection they are able to browse any article currently on the website and download any of them for future browsing and sharing. getmm&ocirc;g&ocirc; also allows authorities and verified organizations to create and share best practices on human-wildlife conflict, ways to prevent poaching, and methods for sustainable income.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    getmm&ocirc;g&ocirc; was built as a progressive web app to have functionality offline and was written with Vue.js. We used the REST API to request information from our database to display different articles for our users. Local storage was a key feature to store any information the user wanted to keep without an internet connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was finding the optimal way to share data offline. Our initial idea of using QR codes became a challenge after difficulty reading them and not being able to generate enough data for sufficient information sharing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One accomplishment we had as a group was to build a web app that can run offline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of us came from little-to-no javascript experience and were able to pick it up along the way, as well as Vue.js. We were also able to learn how to build a progressive web app with offline functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for getmm&ocirc;g&ocirc;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an optimal way to send data offline or compressing our data to be more efficient in sending QR codes. We also want to be able to translate the website into other languages to be more inclusive of the diverse culture in Africa. We will also need more users to add more articles over time.
