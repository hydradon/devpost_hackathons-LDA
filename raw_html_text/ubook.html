                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a platform that allowed students to share the price of textbooks, in hopes of lessening the burden of costs at the beginning of the semester.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to switch books at the end of the semester when they are taking the same class in corresponding quarters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team used Android Studio to build the website app and flask to the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio was very hard to work with. Redis was also hard to work with because it is not made for complex queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got all the UI elements finished and the username/password database works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building full-stack functionality on Android Studio, Using Redis as a quick alternative to SQL for hackathon server-side projects, Deploying servers on google cloud, building flask applications through python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the back-end code and adding features to the app-&gt;need to introduce full-scale backend functionality and eventually hope to allow communication between different users through our servers.
