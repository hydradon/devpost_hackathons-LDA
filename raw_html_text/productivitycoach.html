                    Discord Bot made for HackDavis 2018.
Attempts to increase productivity and goal achievement via time management, particularly in managing gameplay time.
The bot is meant to DM users when their gameplay time is &gt;3 hours, while giving a reminder at 1 and 2 hours to stop playing. The bot also helps run a Pomodoro timer, in which the bot will ping the user after 25 minutes and 5/15 minute breaks. Another addition is the bot's ability to have the user set 'goals' and 'deadlines', and will ping the user when the deadline approaches.
Coded in Python.

                <p>
                    Given that I am not a CS major and have only been earnestly self-learning Python for the past month, I found a lot of difficulty in what was probably beginner level stuff. I had some difficulty implementing cogs at first, and then I spent a lot of time working out the timer function for the Study cog (I then realized I could use self variables declared in the init method to keep track of times outside of the individual commands). I decided to do this project for this hackathon, because I have previously coded a discord bot in python (my only other repo on GitHub) that I used to help learn Python in the first place. My familiarity with getting that to work (albeit the code is messy, and I plan to use the cogs that I learned this hackathon to clean it up) and the simple idea of having a game time reminder bot seemed like it would be a good idea to do for my first hackathon. Nothing too crazy, but instead I made a push for making more legible and cleaner code by utilizing cogs/classes this time. I learned a lot!
