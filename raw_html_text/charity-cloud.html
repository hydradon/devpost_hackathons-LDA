                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from our experience in wanting to contribute to a purpose, but lacking the knowledge of which organizations or causes were credible and which issues we were most passionate about. We realized that this lack of knowledge deterring us from taking those final steps to donate was not unique to us, but rather a large-scale feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With so much content online, it can be overwhelming to find one single charity to donate to, but through our platform, we hope that people are able to easily seek
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our platform by utilizing developing the front end and back end simultaneously through different teams. The frontend team started with a bootstrap base and implemented their own HTML and CSS to adjust the site to their desired functionality, and the backend team utilized Flask and PyMongo. The backend team allowed for the functionality of users to create accounts and donate money to charities as well as charities to create accounts and store information about their goals, website, email, and a picture of their choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and most of our team's first time working with web development. It was particularly challenging to build a backend and frontend which "talked" to each other. In addition, we ran into a lot of errors we had never encountered before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were extremely proud to have a functional backend. In addition, we are proud of the user experience as they navigate the website. We worked to make the website aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of connecting the front and back end and making sure that both parties are able to work together throughout the developing process. We also realized how tedious it can be to use bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Charity Cloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will need to establish ourselves as a legitimate platform. This is significant because we handle charities, so if our credibility as a platform is questioned, so will the charities we display. If there's any amount of distrust between users and charities, no donations would be made.
