                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering none of us in this team knew much about coding, everything was very challenging. However although challenging, it was fun to learn.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Javascript considering that we had no experience coming into this hackathon.
