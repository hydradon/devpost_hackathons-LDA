                    SafeWalk is a web application designed to help people get through cities safely. SafeWalk uses heat mapping technology in combination with Google Maps API to show a color coded map of what areas of a city are high crime. The user's location is used, and they input where they wish to go, and from there they can drag the route so it avoids high crime, dangerous areas. This project implements SafeTrek's API, so if the user is ever in danger on the walk, they simply press a button and their current location is sent to the police.

                    Women are four times more likely to be sexually assaulted than men. Elderly people are targeted for muggings. We envision this app helping everyone stay safer, but in particular those who may be targeted by these brutal crimes. SafeWalk can help all users stay more safe, and quickly alert the police if a dangerous situation arises.
