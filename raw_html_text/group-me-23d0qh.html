                    We wanted to create an app for college students to stay active. Many times, students are discouraged to participate in activities available on campus or around campus because they do not have a group to go with. This app, developed with html, is a website that first asks for one's sjsu email and password to authenticate all users. Once one has logged in, a search bar appears which asks for any activities of interest. If completed, this project would have match keywords in the bar to potential activities around. At the bottom was a list of activities happening that day. The hyperlinks sent a potential participant to the activity's page, which would show any groups of people who have planned to go together and give the opportunity to join the group.

                    Built using HTML and Google Firebase

                    None of us had any HTML experience (all JAVA), and never coded using databases/back end services.

                <p>
                    We did our best to learn HTML today and at least produce the graphics and an accurate idea of the website design
