                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always loved the radio serials from the early half of the 20th century. I wanted to recreate a similar feel, right down to the naive silliness and cheesy comedy of that bygone era. With over 3.5 hours of recorded audio, a custom screenplay, and 9 voice actors, this adventure is packed full of fun, romance, and excitement!
                </p>
                <h2>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill itself is a fairly simple construct employing Node.js all within the Amazon AWS framework. The content was the real challenge! Having to write a screenplay, develop the tools to construct a choose-your-adventure style game, and compile the story into a dataset that supported easy navigation was the real challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realized early that I would need to shift from a software developer to a content developer - making that transition and committing the amount of time to produce this skill was the most difficult challenge I faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publishing the skill before my self-imposed deadline. Writing my first screenplay and receiving a copyright. Working with a talented and fun cast of actors and hearing my words come to life. And seeing how much fun people have with this silly, cheesy, corny, slapstick game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perseverance pays off! If you have a dream, stick to it and don't even consider not achieving it!
