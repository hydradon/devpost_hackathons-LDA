                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a service that allows teachers to track their students' academic performances, help students to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and give better incentives for students to learn and improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides class statistics of overall averages and performance comparisons between subjects.  In addition, we incorporated a test generating algorithm that helps track a student's academic progression throughout the school year and displays graphs that helps a teacher identify each student's academic weakness(es) to help guide them to improving their academic record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML, CSS for the front end. In terms of the back end, we used MongoDB for data collection and used Flask for testing the virtual environment. Finally, we incorporated Python for the test generating algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A majority of the group lacked experience/knowledge in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of being able to create an interface that gives back to the individuals that have aided us and continue to in our academic journey and endeavors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the struggles that we faced, this allowed us to grow and learn more about ourselves and what we can improve on (how ironic, right?).  More specifically, we learned about interface design, pseudo-random generation of operators and numbers, and web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TABS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve upon our website.  A few steps would be to introduce a secure, login page to teachers so they can access the website, consider mental/medical conditions to cater to student personal needs, and to introduce a teacher/parent communication channel to update them on their child's progression and just for overall better communication between the household and school.
