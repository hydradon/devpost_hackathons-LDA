                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this idea came from the drive of 2 colleges students to not only eat more healthy but to be selective about their choices of food in both terms of nutrition and price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app encourages you to eat healthily and cheaply by displaying a nutritional breakdown of the groceries bought as well as a breakdown of cost between stores, with its primary purpose being to have an easy way of keeping an inventory of groceries when going out shopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the primary app off of the expo framework. The backend we coded in a simple nodejs express server, with the optical character recognition that Instabase provides to scan and interpret receipts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into is implementing the Instabase API in the way that we had imagined in our heads. While the service itself is very unique and could offer a lot of potential, getting things off the ground with it took quite a bit of trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regardless of the team size disadvantage or the many roadblocks we encountered, we pushed through them all and never got discouraged or stopped working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous to this hackathon my partner Ryan had not had any experience with react native or any of its libraries. We also have little accumulated experience with authentication, as well as having only having encountered Instabase and it's API for the first time ever, at this hackathon.
                </p>

                    What's next for Grocr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ideas to expand Grocr including branching into offering recipes that would auto subtract the necessary groceries from your kept inventory.
