                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Search and Rescue saves lives. We wanted to make the process for searching more efficient. The idea came from one of our team members who participated in a search for a friend that didn't end well. He noticed that things could be done much more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a web app and a mobile app. The mobile app will keep track of the gps locations of all the volunteers that are out searching and then plot them onto a map so there is a real time update of where has been searched. The web app will act as an admin dashboard for Search and Rescue Coordinators and will allow them to streamline the report process and get important information fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our back-end using Google cloud functions and Firebase Firestore for our database. We used Angular to build the web app and Dexter and Retrofit for the mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along the way we realized that keeping location services running is more difficult than we thought with recent patches to Android. We also had some issues with the google cloud functions not working properly and throwing some strange errors. Creating the database schema also took a lot longer than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how our web and mobile apps look and feel. It's easy to use and fairly intuitive. Also, we are proud of our database schema that we set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about cloud functions and location services in this project. We also learned quite a bit about passing data through Angular components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SAR Coordinator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We talked about this app idea with the Chief of Search and Rescue from Wasatch county and he has high hopes for this app. We plan on developing it further with his direction to make it available for all counties in their Search and Rescue efforts.
