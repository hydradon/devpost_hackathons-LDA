                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an interactive course planner to keep track of Caltech's often confusing Humanities and Core requirements.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows users to scroll through a list of offered courses and drag and drop them onto a 4-year schedule. Users can rearrange courses between and within terms on the schedule. Clicking on a course brings up the course description, units, prerequisites, and grading scheme. The website prevents users from adding courses that are not offered during a particular term and also limits users to 6 courses per term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, HTML, and Python to build a domain on domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with conflicts and merging changes while collaborating on domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to work with JQuery and WebsiteBuilder and building a functional website in a short amount of time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are fairly new to JavaScript and HTML, so we learned a lot about web design through this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Interactive Course Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionality that we hope to add includes a checklist to keep track of fulfilled requirements, an improved search feature, and an updated course listing with courses from other departments.
