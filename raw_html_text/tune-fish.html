                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the disappearance of the headphone jacks and the ever-prevalent Bluetooth connectivity issues,  sharing music between friends requires playlists. What if a playlist was automatically generated based on your and your group's listening habits?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The last 50 songs a user listened to is accessed and processed to analyze its compatibility with the playlist. If our algorithm deems the song a viable candidate, it is added to the playlist and every group member can access it.
                </p>
