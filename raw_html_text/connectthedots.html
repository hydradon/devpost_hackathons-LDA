                    Connects multiple blockchain platforms &amp; traditional software components to create a complete solution.
In this case I have created an api platform that can take documents from Propy, encrypted using user's keys, stored it  IPFS, allowed sharing to other users using nuCypher Proxy Reecnryption library.

                    Explore how such an integration platform can help blockchain ecosystem. Traditional integration platforms don't deal sufficiently with distributed systems and cryptography.
