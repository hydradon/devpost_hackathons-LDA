                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bay area students facing a lot of stress, whether it be academically, socially, or something personal.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app checks on the user every day by asking them a list of questions and then suggesting tips or resources based on how they're feeling. There is a new article and quote presented each day. There is also a calendar section of the app that shows how the average emotion the user felt on a certain day. Each day's information is stored so users can go back and see the details about everything they filled out.

                    How to make the app look good, problems with the blocks given on thunkable (slider).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're pretty proud of the idea itself, and even though the Thunkable app doesn't look so good, we have a slides presentation showing a simple version of the app and what we envisioned it to look like.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to toggle between screens and how code saves information and can recall it later. The entire project was a learning experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're planning on expanding the project, working with it on Xcode and making sure it's more complex and looks good.
