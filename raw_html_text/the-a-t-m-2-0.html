                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration of this project was credit card information being stolen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hack makes it easier for the customer to access their account information while making the process faster and more secure. It uses an RFID chip to access account information and then asks for a customers fingerprint to give them full access. It is a two-step verification process.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using an Arduino with a seeedo shield, a sparkfun fingerprint sensor and an RGB lcd to convey information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges I ran into were libraries not working my version of the Arduino for the fingerprint sensor, and learning how to make the fingerprint sensor work with the Arduino. I also ran into the RFID reader being broken.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of my team completing the project in the time frame I did with not a massive knowledge of coding or Arduino's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to import libraries and work with fingerprint sensors along the way and also learned to implement different aspects of technology to bypass any obstacles, such as using a button to tap rather than a real RFID chip.

                    What's next for The A.T.M 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to get the RFID code working.
