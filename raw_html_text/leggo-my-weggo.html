                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a useful, health centric web app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in user input containing health data and goals and returns a weekly meal plan according to the user's specific needs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python for developing the backend and drawing from the Wegmans API, and used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to develop the frontend that accepts the user input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues connecting the idea of recommended daily intake of nutrients to filtering out potential recipes from the data. Initially, we also had an issue ensuring all of the data was pulled from the API and usable in the format that we needed.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating the beginnings of a web app that could have real utility as a completed application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manipulate data using an API and ways to connect data sets and a front end of a website.
