                    At least 80% of the global population lives on under $10 dollars a day and
                    <strong>
                        almost half

                    <strong>
                        less than $2.50 a day

                <p>
                    Poverty is a huge issue that we as a species simply cannot ignore.

                <p>
                    There is a large amount of evidence that indicates that not being able to cover your most basic human needs leads to a vast array of depression and stress-related mental health problems, and prevents you from developing as a person and following your passions and dreams.

                        incredibly big gap

                <p>
                    What is more worrying about this graph is not that the 1% of people at the lucky end needs several columns to be able to represent their amount of wealth, but that

                    This is a big problem, specially in the wake of the AI and industrial automation revolution that is rendering hundreds of jobs obsolete.
                    <strong>
                        People are becoming redundant in the job market but our current socioeconomic system is not adapting to these changes.

                <p>
                    There is a surprisingly simple (and counter-intuitive) solution to this problem:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                <p>
                    While more and more people are becoming familiar with this approach, most might still find it very surprising, and that's very understandable. This is not a new concept and it's been proven to be

                    However, we are just now starting to experience the extreme consequences of the exponential transition towards a post-scarcity economy where we are finally capable of producing in abundance through the automation of repetitive and often dangerous and not fulfilling work tasks.

                    That is a very reasonable question. While I'm not gonna make a case for a Universal Basic Income -it is a pretty complex (and

                    ) topic- we came up with a formula that could help provide a limited number of people with a monthly income, a
                    <strong>
                        basic income

                <p>
                    With the rise of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, there has been a large amount of interesting developments around these concepts. One key concept for our solution is
                    <strong>
                        the mining process
                    </strong>
                    .

                    <strong>
                        Mining a cryptocurrency
                    </strong>
                    means performing a series of cryptographic operations that keep the underlying blockchain network secure. This usually takes advantage of the GPU power of a machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In exchange for helping maintain security on the network,
                    <strong>
                        mining nodes are rewarded with coins
                    </strong>
                    . However, it is usually really expensive to get set up in order to actually get a good ROI. You need to buy expensive dedicated gear in order to get a good mining system going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some workarounds for this, fortunately. Some cryptocurrencies like Monero or Zcash allow for CPU mining, making it more accessible. Also, the possibility of distributing these cryptographic operations between many computers in a network (a mining pool) offers a very interesting opportunity that we wish to take advantage of:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We want to run a mining pool on third party websites with a big user base, sell all of the rewarded coins and directly give them to people in need on a monthly basis, in the form of a basic income.

                    Let's do a quick recap:

                    <li>
                        We came up with a small-scale way to implement a

# avgYearlyNeighborhoodIncome: from esri, average yearly earning in the last years in the neighborhood where the applicant lives (demographic data)

if (verified == true) {

10000 / (576 + 24142 + 22650 * 0.1) =     0.37060371344
