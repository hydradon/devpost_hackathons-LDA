                    Wearable device contains the various sensors to collects the information about the user medical data, geo location and dynamic movements &amp; send it to the cloud by using Wi-Fi module through the internet and mobile application by using Bluetooth. Web application retrieves the data from the cloud where the medical data are monitored regularly and notify the user about the health condition.
Blood pressure sensor &amp; temperature sensor are used to collect medical data (BP,Pulse ) from the user. User geo location is collected by using GPS sensor and dynamic movements are monitored through the accelerometer. 
Medical industry can use the web application to monitor the patient medical information and various activities which includes movements &amp; geo locations and to build an efficient automated patient monitoring system by getting the data from the cloud 
The mobile application which gets data from wearable device through Bluetooth can be used for personal health monitoring of a user where user can keep track of their medical information.
