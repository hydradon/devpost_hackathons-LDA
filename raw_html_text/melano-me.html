                    Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Once it spreads, the five-year survival rate is only 17%. However, if the disease is diagnosed before it spreads, the survival rate becomes 98% (

                    </a>
                    demonstrated that convolutional neural networks could detect different skin conditions with near-dermatologist accuracy. This convinced us that building an application to detect early-stage melanoma would be feasible. Our goal was to make this technology accessible to anyone with a smartphone. We foresee a benefit for those living in countries without a developed healthcare system.

                <p>
                    We created a standalone iOS app that can be used as a diagnostic tool for melanoma. Melano.me uses a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network to estimate the probability that a photo contains a malignant tumor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Melano.me is an offline solution, the first of its kind. Unlike most approaches, classification takes place directly on the device and not on a server. This is especially important for patient privacy and

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We obtained our training dataset from the public ISIC Archive. In total, we collected about 13,000 images and their binary masks for cropping purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to build our classifier, we fine-tuned Google&rsquo;s Inception-v4 model, which was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. We accomplished this with an AWS Deep Learning AMI instance that allowed us to train our model quickly. The instance had an NVIDIA V100 GPU, which is currently the fastest available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Apple&rsquo;s CoreML framework, we were able to achieve an
                    <strong>
                        average classification time of 0.3 seconds
                    </strong>
                    per frame on a continuous video stream running at 5 FPS.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was getting our app to recognize malignant tumors independently of the orientation of the device. In order to ensure this, we performed data augmentation using various transformations such as
                    <strong>
                        random rotations, brightness and contrast changes, zooms, shears
                    </strong>
                    , et cetera. This increased our dataset size to approximately
                    <strong>
                        63,000 images
                    </strong>
                    . After retraining our network on the augmented dataset, we found that the app successfully detected melanoma regardless of the rotation of the device.
