                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to have a positive impact in my community through technology. So i wanted to build an app that where i could help the homeless people in Atalanta brainstormed for days and i was able to come up with DontWasteFood
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It drops markers on maps and adds a description box.The description includes the pick up time,address,description.Using the information provided food banks can send volunteers to pick up food and later donate in to the homeless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used google maps API  to draw a map,on click JavaScript change marker and description box information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The map wouldnt load time to time,and the markers wouldn't respond onclick or change colors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the project less than a day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stronger understanding of google maps api
                </p>

                    Expand to not just food banks but other services that need to be connected in real time.
