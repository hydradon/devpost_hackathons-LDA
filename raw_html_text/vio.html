                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memories are precious and we must not only preserve them but help others discover their best as well.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vio allows users to capture video diaries at specific locations. Vio will then associate an emotion to the video based on the user's sound and language. Ultimately, the platform will have a heat map of places with varying emotions attached to them. Now one can not only check out the videos of certain areas generated by real people, there will also be unbiased rating of happiness.
