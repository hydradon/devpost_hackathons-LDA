                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really wanted to do a project in Virtual Reality, and I was happy that I got the chance to borrow Google Daydream for the hackathon to make a Virtual Reality experience. I also deeply care about the pressing issue of deforestation around the globe. I wanted to give others a taste of how I felt when I saw a field of chopped trees in the field when I was younger.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeforestationVR gives you a glimpse into how a forest starts to look after many trees are chopped down.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Google's Daydream VR API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Daydream is a relatively new technology without many tutorials. Figuring out how to set it up for the first time was daunting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to figure out how to use Daydream and set up the pointer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that VR is a cool technology and we would like to work with it in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for DeforestationVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to spread more awareness about the state of forests and present this at a National Park one day.
