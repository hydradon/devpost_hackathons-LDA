                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the success of the original AchimQuest at HackTheMidlands, we were eager to expand the Achim universe. After brainstorming several ideas we eventually settled on a Bomberman-style game featuring our favourite maths lecturer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much like Bomberman, in the game you control one of several Achims around an arena, dropping bombs (in the shape of Martin Escardo) to destroy enemies and walls. The game is controlled by the players' phones (by accessing a control pad on a server) while the game arena is displayed on the main screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main game is built using node.js, and the server-phone communication is handled using socket.io (unfortunately Pusher proved inadequate for our purpose).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially tried to use Pusher to handle our server-phone communication, however this proved impossible for real-time events that we were aiming for. Another main problem was communicating the location of walls from the server to the main map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the ability to use phones as controllers - this is kind of cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time George had used JavaScript, so this was a good opportunity to develop his skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to continue we could develop the multiplayer aspect further.
