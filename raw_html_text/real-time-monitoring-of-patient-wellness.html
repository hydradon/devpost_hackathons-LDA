                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In accordance with the challenge posed by Dr. Varallo of Jhpiego: In low to middle income settings, postoperative complications, especially after cesarean sections, account for a large number of preventable deaths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought to create an easy-to-use solution to this problem of preventable postoperative complications and deaths in the form of a comprehensive monitoring system. Our solution is modular, and takes inputs from any available vital sensors, whether camera or hardware based, that are monitoring postoperative patients. Vital information for each patient is relayed to a central hub, where basic information and overall patient status is clearly and simply presented. Nurses can also have an app (connected to information from the central hub) on their personal device that presents essential information about the patients that they are covering in a neat and clear fashion.

                    Scaling up. This system has huge application not only in low-income settings, but first-world hospitals as well. This system can also easily be retrofitted to accept information from more complex and detailed vital monitoring systems for each patient. Information will still be able to presented in a central monitoring location or mobally to nurses who are making rounds or are in other parts of the clinic/hospital.
