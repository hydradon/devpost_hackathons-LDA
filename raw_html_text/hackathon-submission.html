                <p>
                    In order to provide services in the most efficient manner, health clinics would like to hire the right number of doctors to minimize wait-time for patients. This program allows health care providers to enter the percentage of appointments whose lengths fall within each 15-minute range, up to one hour. By simulating a waiting room in which patients arrive throughout the workday and enter the office for the duration of their appointments, this program provides wait times for the day&rsquo;s patients. Using the simulated information, the clinic can decide if they should adjust the number of doctors they hire and/or how many patients they see per hour.
