                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After watching the anime Initial D, I thought it would be cool to have my car play eurobeat whenever I stepped on the gas pedal hard enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads CAN messages over the OBD2 (OnBoard Diagnostics) port of the car, interprets the messages to find how far the accelerator is pressed, and if it's over 80%, it plays eurobeat through a USB sound card to the car's aux input. When it interprets messages saying the accelerator is less than 50% pressed, it stops the audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first used the Macchina M2 hardware and SavvyCAN software to reverse engineer the CAN messages on my car's OBD2 port. Then, I connected a CAN interface board to a Raspberry Pi Zero and wrote code using the socketcan, portaudio and libsndfile libraries to match the behavior I wanted. I used the TinyCore Linux distribution to keep low boot times so the eurobeat can start quckly after turning the car on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TinyCore is a unique Linux distro in that it loads everything to memory upon booting. This required more than the usual linux finesse to get everything working in the operating system. Also, I had to solve issues with all the libraries I used, as well as driver problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thus far, I haven't tested the setup on my car itself, but I have the audio subsystem tested and working, including the Pi software, the car's hardware, and the interface between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the CAN bus, linux, TinyCore, and audio processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eurobeat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I plan to test the project while connected to my car's OBD2 port. When I get this working in the intended way, I'm going to add code to the program to pick a random song from a folder of edited eurobeat audio files each time the pedal is pressed beyond 80%. Finally, I plan on refining the hardware setup and packaging it for sale on retail platforms such as Etsy, eBay, and local Facebook groups.
