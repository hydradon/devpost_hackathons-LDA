                    Section I: Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As aspiring developers ourselves, we've had to self-teach ourselves programming skills countless times. We found one of the hardest things about starting was knowing where to start. With so many opportunities, programs, lectures and videos we all want to make the most of our time and pick the specific resources that are best for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Section II: Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our purpose is to build specific programming courses tailored for each learner and their unique experiences. Whether they want to learn computer vision or the higher-level future of natural language processing, Learnify wants to be able to enable these students with enriching experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Section III: Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with the basics of the UI on figma and a tornado web server. As we moved along, we realized that it was going to be a tough task to model the data using tornado and mongodb as there is no structure. This made us switch to the Django REST framework and the models allowed much more structured data. We then authenticated the client through an API call to see if it worked and then we started working on moving the figma prototype into flutter. We then debugged the backend for a very long time and connected parts of the backend to the client.

                    <li>
                        With so many components, one of the most difficult parts of the project was the integration between 3 areas: design, front-end development, and back-end development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Oftentimes the design elements were too complex to implement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Miscommunication between front-end and back-end resulted in missing or excess components that may not have been developed by either end.

                    <li>
                        We were able to authenticate the user with JSON tokens. We were also able to use models to model the various data structures.

                    More emphasis on the community. Karma, Reviews and other measurements to be drawn from user feedback and interactions. Also adding a more secure system where duplicates people aren't allowed, there is only one session per person at a time and email authentication is necessary.
