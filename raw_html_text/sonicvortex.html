                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As runners, one of the most satisfying and motivating feelings we have is when the beat of our music matches our step. Sometimes, though, this means slowing down or speeding up too much. We needed something that tracks our run and gives us statistics about it, but goes the extra mile to motivate us with music to match our step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tempo is an all-in-one running app that focuses on motivation. Electronic "pump-up" music is motivational because of its fast, strong beats. Tempo plays electronic music as you run, and calculates your steps per minute in real time, modifying the speed of the music -- without changing its frequency -- so that each step of yours matches the beat of the song. If you slow down too much, the music will slow down with you, giving you the extra push to drive it back up. In addition, tempo boasts a frequency-based visualizer built from scratch and a post-run statistics page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our iOS app in XCode using Apple's CoreMotion and MapKit libraries, as well as a third party audio library called Superpowered. The CoreMotion library allowed us to access the iPhone's pedometer data, which is where we got the runner's cadence (steps per second) from. We then used Superpowered to speed up or slow down the song, without changing the frequency and fundamental timbre of it, so that its beats per second equaled the cadence. Finally, we imported a map in the background, which tracks a runner's location every 50 feet, updating a path from point to point along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each library presented its own major challenge. CoreMotion's lack of precise live data forced us to combine other sensor inputs to validate the pedometer data. MapKit's GPS estimation in areas of poor signal made it difficult to track distances inside buildings (although generally, runs take place in the great outdoors, anyway). Superpowered lacks a way to persist audio when the app is closed, so, as of now, the app must stay open for the music to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! The app's interface is beautiful, seamless, and intuitive. Modifying the beat of the music works incredibly well, and no matter what pace you run, the music keeps up with you (yes, we had to run around the building at 3am to test). The map tracks data fairly well in comparison to similar apps, as long as you have decent GPS signal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we both knew iOS to a certain extent, learning to use common libraries is something we strive to do. Motion, maps, and audio are three aspects of an app that show up incredibly often, and learning to use these libraries with minimal documentation and tutorial was a ton of fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for tempo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are obviously a bunch of logistical kinks to iron out in the app, like persistent audio and GPS tracking while the app is in the background or the phone screen is off. We also plan to add more features, like a social network integration, and a way to view all of your past runs. All in all, we're very proud of what we were able to accomplish in 36 hours, and we hope people enjoy our app.
                </p>
