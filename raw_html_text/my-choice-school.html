                    As a senior in middle school I was very excited to move onto my life in high school. However my excitement was swiftly dismantled as I was handed a gigantic book with every single HighSchool in the City!! It was belittling to have such a vast selection of schools and not knowing which to pick.

                    I finally made up a list after tiring and hard research. I handed in my application on the last day it was due. This is why we created MyChoiceSchools. Now we can provide students a fast and accessible way to help them find their dream school.
