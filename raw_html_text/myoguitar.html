                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea after considering what we could use the Myo for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are buttons on the phone screen that can be used to play cords and swinging your arm would strum the guitar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio (but it doesn't work)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't get the sound to play while the button was held down and the arm was swinging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some more things about android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea and putting it to practice are two VERY different things.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a nice idea but, nothing much.
