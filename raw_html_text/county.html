                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My 3 year old son wanted Alexa to tell him how to count to ten in another language. But she couldn't do it. I knew about this skill challenge, so I figured I'd give it a go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    County can show you how to count to ten in a variety of languages. On devices with screens, it shows touchable flags and shows the numbers and written-out text for each number as it counts.
                </p>

                    It's not quite through the skill certification process, but the skill ID is

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Alexa Skills Kit for Node and AWS Lambda to build the skill. I built a set of APL documents and used commands like
                    <code>
                        SpeakItem
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        SendEvent
                    </code>
                    , and
                    <code>
                        SetPage
                    </code>
                    to manage the user interaction and counting actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was most of the way through building the skill, I ran into a bug in the Alexa service. When assembling a
                    <code>
                        Sequential
                    </code>
                    command set that would run
                    <code>
                        SetPage
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        SpeakItem
                    </code>
                    commands to read each number, I found that Alexa would read the first number and then stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I searched the forums, and
                    <a href="https://forums.developer.amazon.com/questions/194676/sequential-command-not-functioning-properly.html" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    . I provided code and details of my issue and, after plenty of troubleshooting, determined that it was caused by two separate bugs in Alexa. An Amazon rep
                    <a href="https://forums.developer.amazon.com/answers/195584/view.html" rel="nofollow">
                        filed the two bugs
                    </a>
                    and promised (also via email) that he'd try to get them fixed before the hackathon deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I didn't hear back after that, but I was surprised when today (a few weeks after filing), the behavior is now fixed (at least in the simulator). So I put the finishing touches on the skill and submitted for certification.

                <p>
                    I'm proud of building a full multi-modal skill. I was able to learn APL and SSML, and get a much clearer idea of how the Alexa interaction model works.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned before, I was excited to learn about APL and SSML. It was also fun to learn some of the AWS CLI functions so I could setup deployment scripts in my project rather than manually uploading through the Lambda portal.

                <p>
                    Once approved, I'll likely spend some time adding more languages (Italian is next). I'd also like to give it a spit-shine on Echo Spot devices.
