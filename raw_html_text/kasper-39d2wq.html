                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all starter with one of our group members standing at the platforms station and wishing to be able to make better use of the time for the commute, for example running home from work instead of taking the train every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was one small incoveniente this person was loded with belongings, the work laptop, folders for a presentation on the next day, briedcase, lunch box...well you see what my point is!!!
Additionally if this person was to go for a run where could this person leave the office attire?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wouldn't it be wonderfull if this person could dropp the belongings in one station and pick it up in another, while enjoying a jog after a stressfull day?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is how the idea was born.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did the front end and back end development of our prototype using  DjangoFramework andBootstrap4.
For the machine learning part we utilized Keras on top of Tensor flow to train an image recognision neural network model and used coins as our token image dataset

                    -Having a properly running code made fromo scratch in such a short time.
-The manner in which we could be inclusive with everyone s ideas.
-How we could upscale the idea from the inspiration to the final idea
-The many application that programm can have depending on the feedback you input. (Very flexible programm)
