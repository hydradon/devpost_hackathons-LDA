                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team first encountered a similar idea online but there were many reasons that people didn't seem to like it so we decide that it would be a good idea to make some serious changes. Our target goal became focusing on creating an opportunity for people to keep up with current events and educate themselves while also appealing to their fun, and competitive nature as a mobile app game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Majority is an iOS based application backed by a database of current events that users can vote on what they think the outcome will be. Good examples of these events include elections, and sports games. Users can earn points for choosing the correct answer, and the sooner they answer, the more points they can earn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team split up into different teams that built separate parts of the project, based on each of our individual strengths and skill sets. Even then, we all had a learning curve approaching this project as we all still had to learn new languages and frameworks in order to make our idea plausible. We would also like to give a shoutout to Soylent, Redbull, Doritos, and Mcdonald's for keeping us going strong throughout the hackathon, even though Mcdonald's messed up our order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into were learning the components of the project that were new to us, and most of these pertained to how each of the parts we worked on interacted with each other. The time constraint didn't help with this challenge, as there was definitely extra pressure felt to both learn and execute these new things we were learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is especially proud of the quality of the design of the whole project. The back end and database are built to be very secure, efficient, and robust. The iOS app is very aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client side is more work than we thought, and it is very, VERY important for the whole team to agree on the diagrams of the project (preferable before everyone starts building their part of the project). Also Manchu Wok is terrible for food.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Fault
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team would like to see the App grow, iron out all the issues, maybe take it out to CUSEC to gage the reaction of others in the industry, and also eventually take it live to the app store.
