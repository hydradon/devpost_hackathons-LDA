                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kickstarter, community energy, and bitcoin. Using the internet and blockchains we can self organize and create our own infrastructure. Applying blockchain we can experiment with finance based projects. A personal passion of mine has been UBI projects and digital currencies allow another possible solution. This allows for efficient provision of social services / benefits. There are small scale tests, using blockchain will allow these to scale larger with smaller overhead.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The public or businesses can give money to a public account. That account pays out it's funds at fixed intervals to all the registered payees. An administrator can register and un-register payees. 
The current balance is viewable publicly by any participant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Solidity smart contracts to do the logic, using JQuery. The front end interface is a payments page which allows anyone to pay in. The other page is an admin page, which allows editing payees &amp; temporarily manually triggers payments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was initially expecting to use TodaQ, but it was not what I was expecting.
There are processing throughput limitations, while not problematic in a  demo, would need to be dealt with in scaling the system. 
There also needs to be a cost efficient way of triggering the smart contract to enable it to run it's monthly payment schedules. 
Importance of rest.

                <p>
                    Creating a demo and discovering the real challenges that need to be solved.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limitation of processing throughput of solidity programs.

                    What's next for UBIDecentralized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement batched payments to manage data throughput. Work on various aspects of governance. Run a small scale test in partnership with a charity focusing on at risk groups of people.
