                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wearable device takes ambient alcohol readings from the air after the user is prompted to perform a breath test. Future models would include a skin sensor that measured alcohol content off the skin to make testing automatic.

                    The web platform tracks the users progress and provides a support network for them in order to help them through their journey to sobriety.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wearable was built using an ESP8266 Wifi enabled microcontroller, an alcohol sensor, and a number of other electronics supplies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web platform was created using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the electronics of the wearable to work in such a short time period was very difficult.
