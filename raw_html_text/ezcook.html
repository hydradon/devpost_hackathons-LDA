                    We saw a bright chance to build very potential solution according to the fact we got but still didn't have any inspiration what we want to build. The Idea was coming  after we saw cooking program on television. The chef was telling ingredients and step by step instructions from television. After that we have solution to helping peoples cooking what they desired using technology by tutoring user starting from ingredients, step by step instructions, until cooking is finished.

                    We are struggling for the right cooking solution, for the right potential user, with fitted function as user needed. And built into the right technology. Also because we are student, We don't have enough resources such as server and database to develope this project into big product. We are testing this product on simulator.

                    There are actually a lot of useful services available that we can use for developing good product and make something useful with it. Also we learn there are many possible approach to achieve something. And another point is, working in team will produce the greatness if the communication method is good and effective. Alexa use voice as its main interaction medium with user. We have learned how user's act and how alexa should act to response it.
