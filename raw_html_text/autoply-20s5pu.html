                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the project came about due to the members of our team recently applying to a lot of internships. A common issue that all of us faced was the very low ratio of callbacks for interviews/phone screens. Given that job-applications take a lot of time and effort to complete, and you have to apply to several jobs in order to get one company to respond back, all of us felt that there needed to be an easier process. And hence we decided to create an app to simplify the job application process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, Autoply, has a very simple and sleek interface. When you first log into the app, you answer a few questions and upload your resume to initially set up your profile. From there on out, your home screen will continuously display job openings and you can swipe right to instantly apply to the job, or swipe left to skip. 
Whenever you swipe right on a job, our servers on the backend will automagically fill out the job application for you; and all you had to do was swipe!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our beautiful front end was developed in Javascript React Native. Our backend was developed in Python Flask. Our backend has been running on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server. Our massive NoSQL database has been hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
At the heart of our project, we are using Selenium and ChromeWebDriver to automate the application process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing this app has been extremely challenging for all of us on the team. Especially on the backend, development had been really tricky. None of us on the team had previous experience using Flask, nor have we used Selenium extensively. 
The biggest challenge with automating the job application forms is the fact that every job application is unique. The huge diversity in the type of questions being asked on the application forms made it extremely challenging for us to get Selenium to properly fill out the form.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finally created a Flask application. For a really long time, I have been trying to learn Flask, and this hackathon has somewhat forced me to learn it, and I am glad.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Python Flask, and I mastered MongoDB Atlas!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Autoply
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to scale Autoply so that we can include more job postings on our platform.
