                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow kids to bike around and explore parks and other fun landmarks near them and earn points doing so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to bike around and discover parks and other landmarks in boulder and earn points for each location discovered.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used dart and the flutter framework to create a mobile app for both ios and android. I also used the google maps api to create a dynamic map and add markers to the map which could be discovered by users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original flutter plugin I wanted to use was broken which required a lot of time to get working properly. Along with that the original haversine plugin I was going to use did not work with the most recent version of Dart which caused me to have to recreate the plugin.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implemented google maps api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the location and maps plugin for flutter along with the haversine formula to calculate the distance between a user and a marked location.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bike Ride Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use google places api to automatically create new places to explore!
Also finish implementation of the stats page to show the user where they have been and the number of points collected
