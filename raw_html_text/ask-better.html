                <p>
                    Critical thinking skills are now more important than ever. To access all of the stored knowledge available to us, it is important that we learn to ask better questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Einstein is quoted as saying &ldquo;If I had an hour to answer a question and my life depended on it, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right question can unlock the right answer, sometimes very quickly, but you must first ask the right question.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software takes a user's question, sends it to IBM Watson's Developer Cloud and returns a classification of the question, which the provides custom coaching for the user on how to improve there question.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Late nights and Red Bull.  We explored different machine learning tools, both Ruby gems and tools from other vendors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a classifier depends on a good training set, so we had to create one rather hastily from scratch. Then we had to tweak the model until we could get consistent and reliable results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time learning different APIs and we went down a couple different rabbit holes that lead nowhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of a good training set.  How to use the Watson API and IBM's Bluemix platform.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to refine the algorithm to add different features and classifiers to improve the coaching. We also want to add a question history so that users can see the ways that their questions improve over time.
