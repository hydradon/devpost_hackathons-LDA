                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make Mathketball to help kids truly enjoy doing math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathketball gives kids three different game modes to sharpen their math skills. In a game, they can challenge their family and friends and get questions of varying difficulty. In a three point contest, they can go for a high score and master their multiplication tables, and in top five plays they can learn new and interesting facts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathketball is built using Python 3, Flask-Ask, and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was perfecting the interface between Alexa and the player to ask and answer the math questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that voice can become a whole new medium for education and making learning fun for kids. I also learned how easy it is to create a deploy Alexa Skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mathketball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More types of questions, a more varied set of difficulties, more math facts, and perhaps a story mode.
