                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that its sometimes hard to communicate with roommates. They "forget" to take out the trash or do other common household tasks. We also wanted to learn IOS development and make a simple but useful app on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HomeBase is a simple bulletin board for your house. You can make an account and register in a house. Once in you can message your housemates, plan tasks for specific people, and get reminders of when those tasks are due.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using swift on IOS. For the backend we used Firebase to create a responsive, real-time database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges throughout the development process. Since we are fairly new to IOS development, it was challenging to build the UI and have it display the proper information at the right times. We never finished the task calendar part of the application because of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that the basic functionality of making posts, pushing them to the Firebase server, and getting them from the server to display on the post wall works. We are also happy that we were able to get user authentication and registration working.
