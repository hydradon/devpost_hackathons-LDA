                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love travel stories &mdash; whether entire books, short stories, or blog posts. I can never get enough!
Since I&rsquo;m on my computer so often, I&rsquo;m always looking for new blogs to quench my literary thirst. I read hundreds of new blogs each year, and most of them I decide I can live without. But I always find a few gems, and I always wanted to create a blog where I can share about my travel experience, travelling is so much fun and we create a lot of memory with that. There should be a place where we can store this memories and cherish it at times so the idea of JourneyBook came into my mind.I experienced other cultures, got lost in a jungle, saw real poverty, conservation projects in action, and met people from around the world. From that moment on, I was hooked in travel. All I wanted to do was travel, see more of the world, and learn more about the people in it.
