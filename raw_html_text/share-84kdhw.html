                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the problem we all run into of over purchasing of common supplies, and often using these supplies once or twice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EffiShare connects people across apartments and dorms by creating a sharing and messaging platform for residents of certain communities to share their household items with their neighbors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, along with Firebase Authentication, Firebase Database, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team was not at all experienced with Android or larger scale software projects so there was a large initial learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without any experience setting up many of these Firebase/Android functions, we ended up creating a close-to fully functioning app, We're also proud of sleeping and showering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half the team did not know how to use Git or Android before this so they learned that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EffiShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on creating a more consistent and reliable messaging service. In addition, we want to add admin capabilities and the ability for a community to flag out bad actors/spam.
