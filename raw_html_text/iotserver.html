                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group wanted to delve into a networking project therefore selected an approach utilizing the concept: Internet of Things. We chose to use Minecraft as an environment to simulate this concept as the game itself has virtual furniture that could be controlled through code/ software much like the objects representing IoT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A android application is used to send data and receive java server hosted on a computer in order to control virtual objects in a Minecraft server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The java server serves as middleware to facilitate a connection between an android application and a Minecraft server by providing commands into the java server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the connection between the Android with minimal knowledge on building or managing a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully sending data back and forth between the android phone and java server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How to use java classes Socket, ServerSocket, AsyncTask, and Runnable interface in order to set up a working server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More experience in developing Android applications, minimal experience in android development
## What's next for IOTServer
Producing an mod in Minecraft that interfaces with the present java server in order to actually control the game from the android application.
