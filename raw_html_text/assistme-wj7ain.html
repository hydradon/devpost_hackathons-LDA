                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought out to take JP Morgan's challenge and looked forward to developing something that would help people with and without disabilities. As we spent several minutes brainstorming ideas on what we could develop we came up with the idea to create something like Uber Eats and Wave which are community-driven services that help those in specific services such as deliver food or deliver to a location, but we wanted to be more open-minded and this is for people with disabilities that may need help.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows users to create posts that will appear for other users and these posts will consist of asking for any assistance needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and flask along with CSS and HTML.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the issue of how we would connect the web app and make it into an application, creating a way to post updates/content to the main 'Assist Offers' screen.

                    We managed to create our web app in python when it was a first-time project.

                    What we learned

                    Finalize a complete mobile application as well as integrating an incentive system to make it more tempting for people to join.
