                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to find a quiz on Quizlet, study for your final tomorrow, get feedback, all without needing to log in to your computer and look for quizlet sets? When we received the Google Home, we wanted just that. We thought it would be cool to have a virtual tutor that could quiz you using flashcards made from anywhere around the world and we also knew that people retained more information when they spoke it aloud so we knew it would be helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robotutor is a google assistant app that can voice your flashcards to you. For example, by just telling it &ldquo;let&rsquo;s study biology&rdquo;, Robotutor finds the best-matching set on quizlet and reads the title and definition of the cards for you. You can navigate between cards as seamlessly as saying &ldquo;next&rdquo; and &ldquo;back&rdquo;. Robotutor will correct you if you are wrong and overtime, will be able to build a profile of your progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Google Assistant to do the text-to-speech and the natural language understanding. We used DialogFlow to compose the intents and logical actions to interact with the user. Based on the intent, we make an API call to the Quizlet API using a Cloud function and retrieve data about the current set/term. Then we save the term/definition as a key value pair and feed it back to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had used DialogFlow or the Quizlet API before so it was difficult to learn. Additionally, none of us had experience using Node.js which ended up being a crucial part of making our cloud function and integrating the backend to the frontend.
