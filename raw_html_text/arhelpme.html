                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discussed different ideas on what we wanted to do but knew that we would like to do an android app without using Android studio. We set out to make an app for people who are hard of seeing, to help them navigate around environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it is able to tell the user the path they should take to avoid collisions between others as well as face recognition which is not fully integrated at this moment. Using AR depth using only one camera we were able to achieve a point cloud of the scenes and make decisions on where is available to walk by.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked for APIs for face recognition as well as depth mapping using the phones camera with ARCore and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything related to Unity was a challenge as it is very difficult to find good support in the APIs we would like to use (free APIs)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to tell the user their path and avoid collisions while allowing them to meet people they know.
