                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main issues with the current SkyScanner app is the fact that you can't currently check to see on a map where it is you want to go. The website does this pretty perfectly, but the app is very centred around a user knowing most of the information about their holiday before entering the app. This fixes that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, FlightJumper brings up a map for you to click on which, once clicked, finds the cheapest flights in that country and lists them in airport-order (starting with cheapest). This means that a user is one tap away from finding out how much it'll be to get to somewhere on their bucket list, and two taps away from being redirected to a provider preparing to give them that holiday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by drawing mockups of exactly how we wanted the app to work. We then decided the next step was getting the Google Map API as well as the SkyScanner API and researching around Android development (since we're pretty new at it). Once we had a basic map displayed, we tried to make the app as close to our mockups as possible, by incorporating the SkyScanner API and making our dream app a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the shear complexity of mixing two different complicated-enough API's was difficult in such a time-limited environment. Although we feel like we've worked hard with the resources and knowledge we have, doing this again would probably mean we would have more time to incorporate better features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working app up and running from a group of limited Android knowledge has been impressive, and it's been a joy to see whenever mini wins (like getting the SkyScanner API up in Android, seeing the Google Map API working for the first time and more) happen.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a hell of a lot, and look to employ this into everyday life in our development careers (specifically around Android development).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlightJumper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up, we hope to fully incorporate user preferences into the app, rather than assuming most of the information for a user. Things like multiple people, different dates etc are still needed.
