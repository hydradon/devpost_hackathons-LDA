                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a realization that our childhood was being forgotten and that the golden days when, as kids, we played actual games, the greatest of which is without a shred of a doubt Connect4. We also realized that we could bring back our cherished childhoods by bringing Connect4 into our tech obsessed society. We asked ourselves, how could this gargantuan task be accomplished, and the answer seemed obvious, 2048 and..... twitter. Thus, after countless hours of toiling away at our screens, the greatest game of all time was born, Connect2048
