                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your child has a rash and a fever. She won&rsquo;t stop crying. You try to Google her symptoms but your phone&rsquo;s Internet is extremely slow. She keeps crying. Page won&rsquo;t load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heal provides quick, easy to access medical advice. Send your symptoms and a doctor will reply with a diagnosis. All it requires is a phone that can text. No need for data. No need for Wifi access. No need to wait on hold for an available nurse or yell over the crying of your child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heal can be life changing for those who have medical questions, but don&rsquo;t have Internet access and can&rsquo;t travel to a health center. Our @help prompt is especially useful for those who are hard of hearing but need to make emergency calls.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heal is aimed at trying to connect users with a doctor on-demand using Twilio, Prompt, and Wolfram. The user will send prompt a text message such as "@health I'm having really bad headaches," and a text message will immediately be sent to an available doctor. The doctor will then be connected with the user and will be able to send back a text message responding to the client's ailment. Using the Wolfram technology, we run through the doctor's response and pull the definitions for medical terms and send that as a another text to provide the user with more information.

                    The major challenge we ran into was using Prompt&rsquo;s API and connecting it with webhooks.

                    We want to produce a suite of health-related prompts. Ideas include an @counsel prompt which will assist the user in connecting with a counselor for mental health counseling.
