                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the negative impact of global warming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our app spreads awareness on the controversial topic of global warming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through xcode using the language swift as a backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was coding the UI without the main storyboard.
Along with that we also had trouble creating and calling classes throughout the program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating our first app using a new coding app, xcode, and coding the UI instead of dragging and dropping it made us feel proud
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program a backend of an interactive app using xcode and not using a main storyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ECOVIATE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will update our app by adding more question and reasoning along with making it look more visual appealing.
