                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kin&rsquo;s aim is to give game developers a unique way to monetize their apps in ways that enhance, not interrupt, the user experience. Kin provides the best solution for Unity developers. However, Kin needed to ensure that its specific needs are addresseding their pain points. The companies collaborated to remove barriers. Following are the building blocks of Kin SDK plugin:
&middot;       Used Kin Name-Space in project
&middot;       Added Block-chain Listeners provided in the SDK
&middot;       Created Instances for Client and Account
&middot;       Created an Account
&middot;       On-boarded the Account with Kin Server and Funded the Account
&middot;       Handled Transactions
&middot;       Sent Transactions to Server for playing the game
&middot;       Implemented event listeners on the block-chain
&middot;       Converted the project to 64 bit
&middot;       Built the APK for testing on Mobile
&middot;       Built the .AAB for uploading to Google Play Store
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge faced was shortage of time for such a grand project. But all challenges were accepted wholeheartedly. The main challenge was to implement it in a seamless way so that the gamers experience is kept abstracted from the Kin Mechanics and feel like every other game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing Kin itself was a huge learning curve for our skills. It gives us a chance to experience making a server for the game and learned how the client side communicates with the created server and the created server authenticates the signatures provided by the client transactions and then sends back and forth to the Blockchain server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Build with
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is built using Unity Engine which provides all the development tools for implementing Kin. Moreover Kin, as stated before, is officially partnering with Unity Technologies which gives Unity Developers a headstart, and the flawless active communities and support gave the opportunity to everyone to try the Kin provoking milestones for themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    More information
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kin&rsquo;s foundation is playing a key role in delivering crypto currency to users with the help of communities like Unity Technologies which is collaborating with Kin. This process has become achievable. Kin lets you reward users in ways that matter to them - improving long-term engagement and retention. For players, it enables earning and spending of kin in games, participation in challenges like competing high-scores and keeping track of Kin balances.
