                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Advancements in computer vision have allowed for body data keypoint recognition, being able to detect specific parts of a human's body by providing X and Y coordinates of those specific body parts. This advancement in computer vision can be used for various projects across many different disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using this technology, we were interested in seeing the accuracy of being able to detect unique hand gestures, which can eventually lead to creating a system of being able to transcribe signed languages (e.g. American Sign language) into writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizes 9 unique hand gestures (Front Fist, Back Fist, Front Peace, Back Peace, Front Palm, Back Palm, Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down,Ok Sign)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming Language: Python
Software Libraries: OpenPose, TensorFlow Keras, OpenCV, scikit-learn, numpy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, built a dataset by recording our own hand gestures, combining for 9000 total labeled inputs (1000 per hand gesture).
Secondly, training a CNN by using TensorFlow Keras. 
Lastly, creating a demo application, which uses the trained model in order to predict a person's hand gestures.
