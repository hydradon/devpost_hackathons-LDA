                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a helpful tool for students and teachers using a speech-to-text service from rev.ai
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TeachRecord creates a live transcript of a teacher's lecture and sends the transcript to the students via a phone app throughout the lecture so that students can look back through the lecture both during and after
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a python script to record user voice input and send data to rev.ai speech-to-text service to convert to text. This text, through Dropbox, is then accessed by a phone app which displays it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constant recording and sending using multithreading caused many problems due to the difficulty of debugging. Also, as novices to Android Studio, it took a long time to understand how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Updates are live. The app is sturdy. The project has much potential given more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constant communication with an API is tricky, especially when using multithreading. On the storage side, we learned to use a script to keep updating local files with Cloud files so they can be used by the app. Lastly, Android Studio has a lot of strange syntax that had to be learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeachRecord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, this app will also be able to store all recorded lectures for cross-referencing or locating using keywords.
