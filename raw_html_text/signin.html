                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many clubs and organizations who still use paper and documents to keep track of their members' attendance. Some members from our club, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, decided to do something about it - create an event management system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Event management program that optimizes organizations by speeding up the process of organizing events and recording the data regarding the event to provide valuable insight. This system will be able to 1) Plan/create events and meetings 2) show events on a Google Calendar 3) Integrate their Google Calendar Calendar 4) Store a database of the members that signed it for each event 5) Sign in members via phone 6) Visualize data of signed-in members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today &amp; Tomorrow was built by using web development tools, including HTML, CSS, MYSQL, PHP, and Javascript
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into was connecting the database with the front-end, and other pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that the prototype works at a presentable level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to use a broad range of programming languages to develop a management system.
                </p>

                    What's next for Today &amp; Tomorrow: Event Management
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project will be used for our engineering club (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) for years to come, so we plan on 1) integrating real-time visual data 2) text reminders on the day of the event, 3) Integrating Google Calendar 4) develop working facial recognition 5) integrate location sign-in
