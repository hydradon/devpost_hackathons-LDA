                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We watch a lot of vlogs on Youtube.  But we never liked the idea of having to subscribe to two channels for the same person.  Sometimes, it's also confusing to instantly tell if it's a real channel or a vlog channel.  And we wonder why there is no website that is dedicated to vlogs.  Of course, Instagram tells a person's interest and Vine makes it simple to summarize a day and Snapchat gives immediate update.  But they don't show the journey of a life which vlogger will express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its purpose is to be user-friendly.  Youtube, for instance, is a bit tedious because users have to go back to the channel to watch another video of the same Youtuber.  Vlogger will have every vlog of the channel from the most recent all laid out so that the user can just scroll through the webpage and click play on the video they desire.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have absolutely no experience or knowledge of making a website to begin with. Thus, we searched up "how to make a website for beginners" and took notes from websitesetup.org.  We got a lot of help from codeacademy on learning the languages we have absolutely no idea about, which are html, css, and javascript.  After going through many exercises of codeacademy, we used liveweave to start our project.  With the help of w3schools, we managed to build this website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to make drop down boxes, side-navagation bars, and tables, which are just never aligned!  Trying to make it stand out from the rest of the websites, such as youtube, is also very challenging.   We also learned that staring at the computer for more than 12 hours makes you very dizzy.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of how we started from scratch and turned a blank script into an awesome looking website.  Of course, there are many things we wish to add to the webpage, but for a 24 hour time limit challenge, we believe it turned out pretty nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned three new languages as well as an interest for making/designing websites.  It was a great experience and we're thankful to be given this opportunity.  It truly opened our eyes to a new level of programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for vlogger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to further improve the website by adding back-end.  We want to create an actual logo for it, add more features, and upgrade the front-end.   It would be great to have it actually be used by people to not just tell others their stories, but to give themselves delightful memories.
