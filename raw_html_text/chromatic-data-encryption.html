                    CDE takes a text file in binary format, shuffles the binary around, then converts chunks of that binary into colors.  It draws these colors in a strip, ending with a .png file to be later decrypted.  Built in Java, this project had several challenges!  Our team had zero previous experience in crypto, and of course, we had little time to learn how to write and then parse the created images.  We're proud that we took our idea beyond its original scope: originally, we only planned to encrypt the data; however, we were able to also include a cipher program.
