                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all grew up in low income communities and used the benefits of SNAP to get our food. We realized we were often eating very unhealthy and even came across some situations where we would have a cart of groceries, wait in the checkout line, just to find out EBT was not accepted there. We want to help people avoid this situation and eat healthier, something we wish we had the chance to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SNAPMAP connects EBT users with various supermarkets/farmers markets and other places which accept EBT. By pinpointing locations on a map, users are given quick and easy information on each business, with reviews. Users can also access their EBT Balance and recent transactions on their profile.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Figma.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems when implementing the idea into reality using code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created an idea which can be taken many steps further and help people who use EBT, giving them a seamless experience when grocery shopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that having an idea is great, but implementing and coding it is much harder. We attempted to code SNAPMAP, but in the end we decided the best way to showcase our idea was through a wireframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SNAPMAP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for SNAPMAP would be to bring it to reality through code and place it on the google play store. Based on our market research, most SNAP/EBT users have android devices. We would then like to take our app further and add recipes, and implement more ways to monetize.
