                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bruno studies, he has found a passion in making beats and original music. This lead to the inspiration to incorporate sound into this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team member Bruno's favorite hobby is to produce digital music. He thought it would be cool to turn data into sound.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code is designed to allow you to obtain a list of tweets for any user and use this program to conduct a sentiment analysis. This analysis determines if the tweet was positive, negative, or neutral. We then start with a low base octave sound pitch and as the tweets polarity increases, decreases, or remains the same, so does the pitch of the sound. Ideally creating a musical expression of the tweeter's emotions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all the libraries that were used are: Gson, Sentiment140, JFugue and Apache HttpClient.
The first step was to compile the tweets from a user from a CSV file.
We turned this data into a JSON object, sent it to the API, and received back another JSON object with a specific data entry named polarity.
This polarity is mapped to a 0, 2, or 4, which corresponds to negative, neutral, or positive SENTIMENT from the tweet as analyzed by the API.
This data is then used to play a specific tone through JFugue depending on the emotion.
Essentially, the next note that plays will be a lower or higher note than the previous one based on the emotion.
The final output is a track of notes and a CSV file to analyze it with graphs.
