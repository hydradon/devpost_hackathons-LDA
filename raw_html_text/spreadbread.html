                    One late Saturday night my friends and I were gathered in our dorm room unwinding after a long week of school. One particular ever-hungry friend attempted to make a late night cereal. Unfortunately, the milk was spoiled and we had to throw it away. It was after this that we realized that this happened on a global scale every single day! However, the milk was tons and tons of food and the garbage can was tons and tons of landfill space.

                    This app was made to solve this problem.

                    It connects eateries, restaurants, and grocery stores to local homeless and food shelters. It ensures that perishable food does not go to waste. It comes integrated with a point-based system that rewards people (especially students) for driving back and forth between these places and bettering our community one milk jug at a time.
