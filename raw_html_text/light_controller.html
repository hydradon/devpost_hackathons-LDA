                    Inspiration: I saw the Arduinos and base shields, and I thought of how I could use them to control lights in a room
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It is a model of system that could sense when someone enters or leaves a room by using sensors that can be hidden under carpet and hardwood floors.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I downloaded arduino on my compute and used the arduino language  for the software.  Then I use a touch sensor to simulate people entering a room, an LED for a light, and a button to put the room in sleep mode.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Mistakes in the delays necessary to have it run effectively
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Having done the project with only 3 hours of interrupted sleep, and not having other group members
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: How to program using Arduino.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Light_controller: Adding motion sensors for marble, brick, and stone floors.  Also using the motion sensors for people with large pets so they don't trigger the sensors.  Also adding motion recognition or voice recognition using a camera or an Amazon echo so people with disabilities are still able to use it comfortably.  Also, possibly using it to help with the morning and night routine.
