                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Magnit Message API ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people who have common likes on Facebook. After that, the app matches these two users and tells them 
that they have common likes which they have to GUESS by working in team. Both users don't see each others profile pictures, names or any other info - complete incognito. The only thing they have - the chat. With communication and will to win they will succeed and guess their common interests. After the win, both users can see each others profile.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CocoaPods, Facebook SDK, Objective-C and, of course, Magnit API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constant wi-fi problems. We had to go to multiple coffee shops outside of the Cal Hacks to get at least some wi-fi connection. In fact, while I am writing this text, I still can not properly test the app!! Damn you wi-fi!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we made the app in less then 24 hours (we are a team of two) without any minute for a sleep.

                    <li>
                        We've learnt how to use Magnet SDK, Storyboards, FB SDK. And we did it without internet connection! :)

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that too much coffee might be not as good sometimes...

                <p>
                    Actually, a lot! At first I want to make sure it works 100% of the time.
