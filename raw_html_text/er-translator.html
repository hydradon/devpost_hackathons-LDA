                    Design Goals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Early Diagnosis and fast, accurate treatment is the key to any successful medical interaction. In some cases, a matter of seconds can be the difference between life and death. More often than we would like, a language barrier gets in the way and either hinders, or completely cripples an interaction between a patient and a Doctor or EMT.
