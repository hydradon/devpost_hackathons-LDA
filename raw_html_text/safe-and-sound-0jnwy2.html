                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After spending time with the senior citizens in our community, we decided to use tech at this hackathon to improve their lifestyles. 40% of our generation will have some form of dementia in old age. The physical and mental sysmptoms of disorders on the dementia spectrum often require people with dementia to have a constant caregiver always present. We decided to aid both the caregivers and the people with dementia by providing a virtual caregiver that helps them using audio AR embedded in their glasses and visual AR through their phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        alerts person to take their medicine, and reminds them of which type and what dose, while using an AR visual of the medication through their phone camera to guide them to the stored medicine location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        detects if the person loses their balance and falls, and alerts caregivers via SMS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        detects tremors (characteristic of dementia forms like Parkinson's) and provides audio feedback to help them reset their walking
                    </li>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Connectivity issues between the frames and different operating systems and devices.
2) Coordinating tasks between members while simultaneously maintaining a feasible scope
3) Learning Unity from scratch
