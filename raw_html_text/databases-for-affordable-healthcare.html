                    We kept brainstorming ideas until we came across this one. We initially had three other ideas throughout the hackathon, but all of them failed due to technical limitations. However, all of us had a goal in mind to use our programming skills and apply them towards healthcare. Throughout these last 24 hours, we learned new platforms, such as Google Cloud, Jupyter Notebook, and new git commands. We ran into many challenges with this project. To begin with, our dataset was overfilled, causing our graphs to look as if it were visually inaccurate. Second, we tried to utilize some of Google Cloud Platform's APIs, but ran into much trouble with all of them except for Firestore because of security credentials. Third, we were unable to come up with a final idea until much later in the evening. Overall, much of the functionality we desired to implement simply couldn't be done because of these complications and a 24 hour time limit. However, we are passionate about this idea, and would like to see if this concept takes off in the near future.
