                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just to get a better view of the current situation, we called up the customer service and we disconnected after 7 min of wait time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the user actions in the existing app and with the power of machine learning, we built a prediction model for what issue the user might have contacted for and also encourage the user to use the chat service as customer representatives can handle multiple chats at a time but not calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analysing the user actions and training the model created by us was a challenge as we did not have large data set to begin with. But our solution will give a data set over time and with customer service team and our report model we can train it attain high accuracy.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to analyse the user actions and we have a pretty good model with acceptable accuracy with small dataset that we could generate in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work, how to handle pressure and basic concepts of machine learning.
                </p>

                    What's next for Smart Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's integration friendly and we look to increase the accuracy of the prediction and also the metrics data could also benefit T mobile from marketing and promotion point of view.
