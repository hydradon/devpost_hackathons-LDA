                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I downloaded the data set and converted the DICOM MRI scans to JPEG files. In python, I trained the Inception tensorflow model with this data set. Since the project was very large, I optimized the algorithm and associated files for mobile.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training the model with 10000+ images on CPU took very long. There are significant limitations as to the efficacy of the results as I did not try to optimize the hyperparameters.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this in 20 hours of work since last night and learned a lot the whole way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training a deep neural network with a large data set requires significant computation power. I learned that this product would work better if I had worked with a team. Since I heard about this competition only a few days ago and started working on it last night, I did not have the input of other minds nor is it a product ready for real medical use.

                    Get a team together, rebuild and retrain the model, rigorously test it, consult with doctors and pathologists at UCSF, optimize, get user feedback.
