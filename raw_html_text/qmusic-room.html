                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by listening to music together as friends during study sessions. However, not everyone likes music while studying so we wanted to allow people to share music while wearing headphones. That's why we made a synced music service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone can enjoy the same song together without disturbing their surroundings and everyone can contribute to the playlist. Songs people enjoy are added to the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase, WebSockets, and Node.js to sync the browsers together and the YouTube API to display the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase and WebSockets were challenging because of the asynchronous methods and how certain connections had to be verified.
                </p>

                    What's next for QMusic Room

                <p>
                    We plan on continuing to develop it for personal use.
