                    Your "junk" just got a dating app.
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing I realized was how fast someone can make a connection with someone via the "swiping" dating apps, and I thought, can this idea be applied to things for sale? Surely, this would improve the rate of your sales by going through a lot more buyers in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start by making an account on SaleSwipe, and immediately, you can start selling things/services through postings, or if you're looking to buy something of that nature, you can take a look at all of the postings that have been posted by other sellers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you find something that you'd like to buy, you can "swipe right" or click "Yes!" on a posting and that user will be notified by email that you are interested and after that the process of sale is similar to Kijiji, where the seller and buyer decide the sale on their own terms. Don't worry about the formalities, you just focus on finding what you want/need : )
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, if you made postings, and someone likes your products, you too are notified via email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS for the front-end, and PHP as the back-end logic for the application. I used heroku to deploy the app so that everyone else can try it out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With an application like this, data collection is a must. I tried using some free hosting services, but the URLs that they gave for my sites are blocked by uWaterloo's network. So I had to learn how to use XML to store and query data from, so I didn't have to rely on databases. I know how dangerous this is in terms of security and I tried my best to obscure the data collected, but this is a proof of concept so I wasn't too worried about security issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to establish a social network in the time frame of a night filled of caffeine and tons of setbacks on my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XML is actually pretty cool way to organize data. It's also very flexible too, so I could organize the data collected it to my liking to make my queries easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SaleSwipe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea needs to be thought out more than just a night of hacking. It's a cool idea, and I see myself going back to this. Maybe some market research might need to be done to see if the idea is feasible before any more hacking is done.
