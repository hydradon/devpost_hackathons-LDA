                    What is it ?
Usually a common citizen have less chances to contact the govt directly. If he want to share something or a problem which needs govt attention then he will have to go through a proper channel which will take too long and much resources. It leads to complexity and complexity leads to problems. So I just tried to make the citizens able to contact the govt directly or almost directly using KpApp which is an android mobile app.
This project consists of two parts.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Client Side ( android app )
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server Side ( online website )
The client side is for citizens and the website is for govt.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    How it works ?
This app works much simpler. Every user can contact and inform the govt in few clicks. Once the app has been installed the user will select an image, either from image gallery of device or capture new one on the spot, which shows the problem. Then the user will select the category in which the problem lies (currently 4 categories are available, more can be added). After selecting the category the user will mention his/her name and comments ( a kind of message for or request to the govt ) and upload the image to server. Location of the user is picked using gps or network provider and is uploaded with the image along with the name and comments.
The server is actually a google map which retrieves the data from db and shows it to the govt in form of map markers.The marker points to the exact location of the user who uplaoded the image and shows details (image, name &amp; comments) on click. Map will have as many marker as many there are uploads by the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now the govt knows everything and all which is needed is "Action".

                <p>
                    "This app is just a prototype and can be improved."
