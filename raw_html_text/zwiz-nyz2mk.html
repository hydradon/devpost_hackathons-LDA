                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After speaking to a few volunteers about what would help them to serve the homeless community, the consensus was that a smartphone and web-based application that was easily configured would help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a program that functions like a flowchart / expert engine for guiding non-experts through complex decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client / Server model with centralized LAMP system communicating with individual volunteer's smartphone via the Internet. It is a powerful, EASILY customized application with unlimited uses!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fatigue of an event like this, coupled with my physical limitations. It was tough, but we kept our "eyes on the prize" and believe that we've delivered a very useful product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing what we came to do - creating a minimal useful version of our flowchart / expert engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functions that some of the volunteers thought would be useful in such a coordination app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rest, sleep, and waiting for the judge's decisions. We had a great (and difficult) time, guys &amp; gals! Thank you for this wonderful opportunity.
