                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The main motivation for this project is to make game based on elementary physics for education purpose. A game that will make students learn physics formula and have fun at the same time. This will help students to learn the formula and understand concepts by incorporating it to the game environment, thereby fast learning.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The player will wear the Oculus and enter into a virtual reality world. The player will have a gun and he can shoot electric pulses. There is a voltage meter attached to the gun, which shows the voltage of the pulse firing from the gun. Player can change the voltage using joystick which will be reflected in the meter. Once the game starts humanoid robots and giant mechanical mosquitoes will comes to the player from all directions. Each of these will have a value of resistance and current, which will be displayed as text above them. The goal is to destroy the robots by shooting pulses. If the player shoots with the voltage given by Ohm's Law (V=IR), he will get extra points. If he fails to destroy robots before they reach the player, he will get negative points.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We used unity and steam for UI development. And Oculus for deployment.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Most of us were using unity for the first time and had no experience with VR. It was fun learning something new from scratch, even though it was hard to do it in this limited time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We are really proud of finishing 'Etaki' in this time frame.   Knowing that this game will make physics education more fun and efficient is  the realization of our goal itself.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We learned to use Unity and Steam to develop VR based games.

                    What's next for Etaki
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The future goals of Etaki is to extend to other topics in physics and develop similar VR games which help them to learn physics in a fun environment.
