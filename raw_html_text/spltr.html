                    Imagine you're out with friends at a busy restaurant. You're waiter has been running around the entire time you and your friends have been there - and the last thing you want to do is bother them with splitting your bill. That's where Spltr comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's as simple as opening the app and taking a photo of the receipt. Once everyone claims their items, Spltr will do the heavy lifting and calculate itemized splits for everyone.
