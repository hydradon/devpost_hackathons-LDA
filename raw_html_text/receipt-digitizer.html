                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always crumple up our receipts and either throw them out or end up in the laundry. Why not save them for budgeting purposes? Because it is too tedious. And that is why we made Receipt Digitizer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User can take a picture of their receipt and then throw it away. The app does the rest by parsing the receipt into strings to be stored in an excel file. This includes every single product and the amount paid for that item.

                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Using Android app (Java) and a server to handle parsing using javascript and node.js
