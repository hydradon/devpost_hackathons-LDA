                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that allows users to upload their art as a way of communicating with the community

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Sublime Text Editor and used the languages HTML, Machine Learning and CSS. We also used a sketchbook program for the art
                </p>
