                </h2>

                    EmoBuddy is an app that can automatically tell what kind of content you want to see, based on your emotions when looking at image content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end/ mobile-side of the application was coded in Visual Studio, using Xamarin, a cross-platform framework in C#. This was responsible for streaming images to the server, as well as grabbing image content from wikipedia, and contacting IBM Watson to tag those images with meaningful labels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back-end was implemented in Python, using the Flask framework. It utilized the Microsoft's emotion api to do emotion recognition from facial images, and imgur's api to host images temporarily on a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Https can make hacking more difficult than it should be, and Xamarin can be a bit buggy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to work with many new and fun APIs, and learned some fascinating things about syntax, ssl, web-hosting, and the fickleness of Visual Studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for EmoBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fully functional app that generates web content (more like news feed) based on your facial expressions regarding a certain topic.
