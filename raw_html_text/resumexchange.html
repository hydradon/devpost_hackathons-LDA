                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recruiters at career fairs meet hundreds of candidates and attend tens of such career fairs. This entails having thousands of paper resumes to go through to find the correct fit for a job(s). The candidates on the other hand have to constantly worry about changing their resumes at a thousand places Linkedin, handshake, MS word , etc. We aspire to introduce a tool that streamlines the hiring process, specifically at the career/job fairs. Using ResumeXchange the recruiters will constantly maintain events (job fairs) under which they will have electronic resumes of the candidates they met. Which will always keep them in touch only with the fresh talent and applying our provided filters, they can search for the best candidates suited for the job.
This means we will have to really understand our customers. I've seen this problem several times but hadnt acted upon it until the opportunity of this hackthon came to me. I've built a prototype of the app and will continue building it to turn it into a service which eases the hiring process,

                <p>
                    Candidate (Job Seeker) :
Upon registration, The candidate will fill out provide us with the details regarding their academic background , known skills, professional experience and interests and we will provide a unique 4 digital code which we call rxcode. Whenever the candidate meets a recruiter who is our registered user, the candidate will simply provide their rxcode which the recruiter puts in to our web app and gain access to the candidate's resume instantly. Now imagine, if this candidate goes to a job fair with 50 recruiters who use our service. This saves the job seeker 50 pages, a free hand (from being busy holding the holder), an opportunity to be really discovered and the pleasure of being eco-friendly.
Any updates in the Candidates profile will also be reflected in the Recruiters view of that resume instantly, even after being sent. Thus the Candidate will have to update their resume at only one place.

                <p>
                    Recruiter (Candidate Seeker):
Our niche would be recruiters recruiting majorly from career/job fairs, since they will desperately fall in love with the service, these people will not have to go through a thousand resumes to find their golden nuggets. (future features) They can simply apply filters and search based on experience, skill-sets, passion, interests (cultural aspect) and education on these resumes and get only those resumes where the candidates are truly qualified. Plus the ease of having all of this on their finger-tips (literally).
