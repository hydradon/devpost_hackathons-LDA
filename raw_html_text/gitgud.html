                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As developers, we use GitHub all the time, and we've found that it can be tedious. We wanted to help others like us, while allowing them to get the nutrients they need (well, at least the ones that pizza can provide).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GitGud allows you to do git commands on several repositories at once, including pushing, pulling, and cloning. Furthermore, it has a functionality to take an error from a command line command and automatically search for it on Stack Overflow and print the top answer to the command line. Finally, and most importantly, it provides a command to order Domino's pizza.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed GitGud using shell scripts to create the commands and initial startup scripts, as well as Python to perform more complex queries and parsing operations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting a unified OS on which we could all develop, and our Windows users had to learn about the Linux filesystem and command line. We also had little cumulative experience in bash scripting, so we all had to brush up on our bash skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time any of us have ever finished a Hack project! We've started several among us, but we've never found an appropriate scope. And we slept. And we implemented pizza ordering via command line. Enough said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about bash scripting and existing command line tools. We also improved our skills in project management and collaboration. Some of us even learned how to use the Linux command line and Vim.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GitGud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will clone the world! Actually though, we're hoping to add more related git functionalities to our commands library and expand the flexibility for users so that they can use their usernames/passwords instead of an access token, and so that they can use Github's SSH functionalities.
