                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always found that the homeless and lower income brackets and disproportionatly affected by the lack of internet services. We believe that their lives can be vastly improved if they were able to access basic information that those in higher income brackets take for granted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go Go Help ensures that those with basic SMS phone texting can message our number and get the information they need. Those who are homeless cannot plan ahead for the weather, nor check themselves into nearby rehab centers, nor can they discover the bus schedules on the fly. However, with Go Go Help, these members of our community can easily access each of these things at just the push of a button.
