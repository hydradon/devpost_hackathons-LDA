                    Inspiration - Me and my friends noticed that how in a busy college schedule one often forgets to drink water .As we know that water is extremely crucial for a healthy and efficient body functioning .
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is for this reason why we came up with this idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does - According to how much water we should drink in a day , this bottle periodically reminds you to drink water by flashing a green light . Also this bottle reminds you when your bottle is nearly empty and you need to fill it by blinking a red light!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - First we made the circuit assembly on a breadboard which involved Arduino, LED's, resistors and an ultrasound distance sensor . The ultrasound sensor helps us calculate how much water is there in the bottle . We then soldered the entire circuit on a perfboard and then programmed the arduino to work as explained above .
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - We first ran in to the challenge of selecting the appropriate sensor to measure water distance . Then we were challenged to code in a way that red and green light blink on different inputs by the ultrasonic sensor. We also faced a challenge as to how to create a compact enough circuit to fit inside the bottle (We then came up with the idea of using a perfboard) .We also faced the challenge to solder the entire circuit n the perfboard.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Bottle is able to correctly detect and alert the user periodically
2)In our group's opinion this is a revolutionary product and can make the lives of college student much more efficient and healthy all over the world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I fall short of words to explain what a tremendous learning experience it was.
Starting from how a simple breadboard works to an Arduino Nano , everything was new to us . We learned many vital electrical engineering and CADing skills .We learned about how an ultrasonic sensor and works and how its use be extended so well . We learned how to actually implement the coding we know in the real world .We learned about circuitry in a way we couldn't imagine before .I can keep on listing but the list is ever lasting
                </p>

                    What's next for H2O Plus -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make a more compact product with nano circuitry and other enhancing features which would allow the product to take a placeholder in a market!
