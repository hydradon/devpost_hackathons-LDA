                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About 10 years ago I migrated from Europe to the United States. I had not established credit and no way of taking out a loan. No bank wanted to take a chance on me and lend me money to put a down payment on a car. I had no way to get to my work and had to beg my friends and family to drive me everywhere. It was painful and cumbersome to say the least. It was a little over 6 months before a Credit Union would approve me for a pre-paid credit card with a whopping limit of $350. After about a year of making my credit card payments religiously on time, I was able to build just enough credit history to get my load application approved to buy a car. This process was very slow. There has to be an easier way!

                    is a service that allows people, with or without credit history, to apply for a personal loan. It is designed to facilitate the lending from family or friends, while taking away the bureaucracy and burden of the process.
