                    Give2Get is the revolutionary app that allows you to get paid while leveraging your social media influence. This innovative app allows you to earn money without having a minimum follower requirement like many outdated social media reward programs.

                    The user will login to Give2Get, and they will be able to choose what brands they want to start earnings rewards from. The selection of brands will be determined based on the user's location. We have partnerships with hundreds of restaurants across the country like Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Taco Bell, Chipotle, and McDonald's.

                    After the user selects which brands they want to earn rewards from they will be directed to the brand's Instagram account. They will be able to repost various pictures/videos or like photos on the account. Once the user reposts, they will earn coins based on how many of their followers or friends interact with the post.

                    The user then can exchange these coins in their virtual wallet for real dollars at the brand stores/websites that they earned them from. The coins are then delivered in the form of promo codes which can be redeemed at the brand stores/websites.
