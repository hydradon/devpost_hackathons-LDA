                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After many hours of brainstorming and throwing around wild ideas out team was able to figure something out that would be both feasible in the short period of time and useful for me people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to connect with each other at the library to study together. This allows for an enjoyable social aspect as well as a collaboration aspect.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created much of the front end software. I thought of all the possible information that would be needed and had to think of an efficient way to gather and store all of it. My other team members worked on the backed and they worked on a server to connect the phones together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping track of all the data was the most difficult part. The data was consistently changing and making sure it was updated accurately and efficiently was a tough task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never used android studios before and I was able to create much more of the design than I thought I would be able to in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how important planning is in developing such a large project. Most of our road blocks were caused by a lack of planning and could of been easily avoided.
                </p>

                    What's next for Colab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we were not able to finish it during our hackathon, but I plan on continuing to work on it to build my skills for the future.
