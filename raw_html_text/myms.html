                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The experience shared by the doctor, an actual MS patient and the children of people suffering from MS inspired us to build something that gives them the power to achieve whatever they wish in terms of their disease (tracking, monitoring, affectability, community etc.) within their hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does everything a friend should do. Occasionally asks how you are feeling,shuts up if you ask it to, increases frequency of questions if you allow and devotedly notes down all you share with it. Also reminds you what made you better or worse last time so as to help you figure out best practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also introduces you to a community of patients just like you, so you can help each other handle and overcome the difficulties you face together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the iOS app using React-Native amd the backend using GO, deployed to heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an iOS app using 3 windows laptops was a very real, true challenge. So was deploying the GO backend to heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A successful implementation, integration and deployment of the front &amp; back ends are accomplishments that we're proud of. Couple of main happy points:
Notifications with options
GO deployed to Heroku

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot - about MS, how it affects people, how there can be so many different things that a simple app can do for a person with MS and bring about a positive impact in their life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyMSCompanion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to collaborate with the Norms organizers to make this app a powerful reality for all MS patients out there who just need a little something to look forward to everyday - be it friends, mentors, tracking or monitoring.
