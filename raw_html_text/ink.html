                <p>
                    Kids are getting into programming in middle school, and some of them are genuinely confused by the different data types and return types and all. Everybody still forgets semicolons. These minor setbacks make programming a chore, and getting code to compile seems futile. To combat this, we made Ink, because its the easiest way to get what you need done.
