                    What is it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KareBear is a teddy bear that can talk to children. It helps busy parents communicate to their kids (using speech-to-text and text-to-speech) and provides translations for caregivers of children who don't speak English as their primary language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kids don't need more tablets or smartphones. What happened to the good old days where kids used to actually play?
KareBear embraces technology that does not harm your kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KareBear can speak (what the parent types) and play songs (determined by the parent). It can transcribe your child's spoken words into text and translate it. It can quiz the child on simple arithmetic. But above and beyond that, KareBear is a loving companion for your child.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a Express + Node.JS platform. Integration with Google's Speech API. Customized Bootstrap for frontend.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did I mention that hardware hacks are hard?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a great product! I built something that I would want my kids to use!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware hacks are hard. Coming up with a good idea that's doable.

                <h2>
                    What's next for KareBear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More functionalities (such as vocabulary learning and checking for the right answer); different bears: tutor bear - languages, health bear - heartbeat monitor; maybe camera features.
