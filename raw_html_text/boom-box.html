                        You've been on the aux cord and got annoyed because people kept coming up to you asking if you could play their favorite song next?

                        Have you ever been with a group of friends and couldn't decide what to play? 
Situations like these are where our project comes in.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an iOS application that allows users to create a party and have members with a Spotify account vote for songs and add them to the next up queue. This way, if you're ever at a social gathering where someone is playing music, they can't hold the aux cord hostage so long as you have Spotify.

                        Spotify API currently does not have an endpoint that allows you to add to someone's queue
                    </a>
                    this means that we had to implement this logic manually on our own. We did this by using the
                    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/add-tracks-to-playlist/" rel="nofollow">
                        Add to playlist endpoint

                    and the

                        Reorder Playlists Tracks endpoint
                    </a>
                    to continuously add songs to our playlist as it's playing, and then change the order of the songs based on how they did in the vote.
