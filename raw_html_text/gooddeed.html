                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop something useful and self-less that would give people opportunity to help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides people an easy way to earn volunteer hours and help out their community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native, a few API's for back-end processing, and a couple of databases to store different types of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with React Native due to it being relatively new with little documentation or support for key functions. This hindered our capability of using other software in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our design and team collaboration throughout the project. Everyone in the group gave each aspect their all and had a huge part in the finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned product development and the amount of effort it takes to get around obstacles in a timely manner without cutting corners in quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoodDeed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on sprucing the app up and creating a web app portion of the project, and publishing the app across all platforms.
