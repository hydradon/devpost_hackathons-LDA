                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not always easy to eat healthy in college. HealthyFave lets you know exactly when and where you can find your favorite meal at one of the Purdue dining courts. We wanted to create an app that makes a healthy lifestyle more accessible to college students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is specific to Purdue students. Each day, it checks if the user's favorite meal is being served that day. Then, it sends a notification if the selected healthy food is at a Purdue dining court for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The notifications display which dining court(s) to go to and for which meal. Users can set the time when notifications are sent for each meal to match their schedule. The "desired meal" entry field auto-completes to allow users to easily find the item they're looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the app with Java. It uses the Purdue Dining Court API to extract information about when the specified meal is available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time creating an Android app. The most challenging ideas to implement were asynchronous API interaction, repeated scheduling of notifications, and autocomplete/time user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app actually functions as intended. HealthyFave is a product we can use in our daily lives and share with our fellow students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn everything about making an Android app. We developed many new skills, including XML, alarm/notification scheduling, and SharedPreferences manipulation. We also improved our previous Java skills with new ways of modular thinking such as Activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HealthyFave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will allow for selection of multiple healthy meals to receive notifications about.
Other ideas include excluding undesired dining courts, displaying dining court hours, and displaying nutrition information.
