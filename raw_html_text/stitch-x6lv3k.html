                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertical video syndrome is at an all-time high. Humans as a species are naturally unreliable and slow to change. Instead of trying to change people, let's try to fix their blunders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stitch uses the power of computer vision parallel computation to convert vertical video into a its widescreen counterpart. SIFT descriptors are collected for each frame, and homographies are calculated for each pair of neighboring frames. Efficiency is achieved through the commutativity of homographies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Scala for its functional features. A lot of the subproblems within Stitch are very conducive to functional programming. Additionally, BoofCV, an image processing library, is written in Scala.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first algorithm was extremely slow. A 15 second 720p video would take around 3.5 hours. Now it takes around 30 minutes. Further optimizations can be made.
