and an SMS will be sent to someone who can revive the user.

                    Leveraging AT&amp;Ts M2X time series data storage

                <p>
                    Most of our lives can be quantified in one way or another, but sleep is one facet of
our life that is typically left out of consideration. Some people track how much they
sleep, yes, but how many people keep detailed, unique, and insightful statistics on
every night they sleep? Not a lot. This is our solution to that. By using three
sensors, visual movement, movement of bed, and breath counting, all publishing
themselves to their own M2X stream, we can pull that data and analyze it in
meaningful ways to the user.
