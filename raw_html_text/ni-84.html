                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a calculator that could run full fledged data processing software such as Octave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for data collection, lab instrument control, calcuations, sensor data collection and anything else a linux computer should do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We salvaged a broken TI-84 calculator and mapped the keyboard matrix with an arduino. We hacked the case to fit all of the electronics and installed a Raspberry Pi 3 inside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ethernet refused to work on our expansion connector, and also various other soldering and software challenges such as drivers not cooperating well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapping the keyboard to the arduino. Fitting all of this hardware into cuch a small form factor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult it is to reverse engineer products to link them together in such unconventional ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NI 84
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would hope to get it fully functioning as it was to difficult to integrate the hardware with only a two man team.
                </p>
