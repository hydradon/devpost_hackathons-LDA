                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this game stems from Spencer's imagination. He wanted to create a game with an intrusive AI that controlled and messed with the player. Everything from the mechanics to the color schemes would be different for each play, which would change the game each time. 
Although we weren't able to fully implement this idea, the game still encompasses its beginning stages - it has a seemingly innocent character with equally adorable enemies and a randomized environment set against the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built on LibGDX with Java, with assets created on Adobe Photoshop. Elizabeth and Ines created the art and UI design, while Spencer programmed and built the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge so far has been creating a game without an engine. It was difficult at first to get the program to show an image, but we were able to get it working after a few hours. Our other main challenge has been our limited resources and time during the event and the scope of our overall project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall game mechanic of not having any set mechanics makes for an incredibly interesting game. The artistic direction Ines and Elizabeth took for this game created a lighthearted mood with a deep story yet to be unfolded. The characters and enemies may seem nice, but there is much more to the dark cavern walls than can be seen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Collisions are hard, animation is hard, movements are hard, and enemies are hard." - Spencer
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This time I took a different approach to my art. I sketched the ideas first, and later brought them into Photoshop to create finished product. I helped me complete the concept first before I started thinking about what the actual asset would look like. Also, In the Heights is a great musical to listen to while under a time constraint" - Ines
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I have gained more experience in learning how to create assets for a video game, all the while being on a team and communicating" - Elizabeth
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deep Delve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI development! We plan on finishing developing the AI that will run the story of the game and its main mechanic. This way, each play will be randomized and different, including the type of level and its difficulty.
