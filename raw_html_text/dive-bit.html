                    Our Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Kian, is a diver. He realised that novice divers often struggle conveying problems they may be having in the water to their instructor and then they panic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device reads the student's heart rate, breathing rate and their temperature.
This data is sent to the instructor wirelessly. The data is then analysed and if any of the variables fall outside of a critical range a buzzer is sounded to alert the instructor of the potential danger the student is in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to work out how all of the various components worked with the micro bit. Then we joined them all together on the micro bit and analysed the various inputs to get coherent outputs, which were then further analysed to see if they fell outside of a certain range
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first tried to use a peripheral temperature sensor for it's increased accuracy but it was determined that the clock speed of the micro bit made it incompatible
We also were going to interface the system with an android device but were unable to connect the two devices. So we opted for the micro bit -&gt; micro bit interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never worked with electronics before and so making a working, and potentially useful, device in general was a great achievement
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dive Bit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could fully integrate the system into diving gear, and make it built into the suit and so it would be as easy as wear and go!
