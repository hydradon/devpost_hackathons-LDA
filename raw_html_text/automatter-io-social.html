                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pokemon. Nintendo. Steam. Yugioh. I want to recreate that exclusivity with digital goods and make people work for it.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Allow artists, films, brands and companies to create limited edition collectibles. They can trade amongst themselves and do bounties to get them.
