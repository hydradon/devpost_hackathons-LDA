                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole point of Snapchat Spectacles is to capture every day moments from the human perspecive and without the interruption of a phone. We think VR is the perfect way to replay these memories instead of a on a phone display restrained to rectangular screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Redoo allows you to export your Snapchat Spectacles memories and view them on a GearVR. This way you can relive those moments from the first person perspective, just like you took them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app entirely in Unity. Using Android intent and data stream we can pass shared Snapchat memories to the VR application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Snapchat has no official API. We had to hack around the limitation and sniff out the data it sends in Intents which allows us to make our app a receiver of Snapchat share intents.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We spent a lot of time trying to execute native Android methods (Java) from a C# client running in Unity. This made it difficult to test without deploying and slowed down deploy cycles to our GearVR.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Video support un Unity recently changed so we were learning it for the first time.
                        </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It feels really cool to replay months worth of first person videos as if we were there again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Redoo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to clean up a lot of the hacky hardcoded Java to C# implementations that try to retrieve snapchat videos. We'd also like to make it easy to share snapchat videos imported into Redoo with others so that they may experience what you did as if they were in your shoes.
