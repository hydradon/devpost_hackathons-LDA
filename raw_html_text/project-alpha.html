                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is 6.6 billion in cost due to company claims.
14% of this due to machine failure.
Why wait until it happens if you could prevent it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The insured Company is able to access sensor data of their machine with an app.
A faulty machine throws a warning and shows extended sensor data with which the
insured company can afterwards decide if they cooperate with their insurance to assess risk.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MaskRCNN for data segmentation and sensors on hardware for futher damage detection.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long labeling sessions for the data to do the training
Complicated paper to understand how sensors work
Bringing the different ideas together to find a suitable solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvising
Adapting the solutions to the problem as much as possible
Keep the big picture in mind while developing.
