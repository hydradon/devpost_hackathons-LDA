                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was staring into a reflection of my T-shirt with "Oklahoma" on it; the reflection read "Amohalka."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interface to enter, import , or export text.
Encryptor button- Takes any phrase and will encrypt the String to be un-readable
Decryptor button- Takes a previously encrypted String and will convert it back to be readable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Java from scratch
Bryant worked on functionality
Yihao worked on the interface
Yan worked on app implementation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few bugs dealing with differences between programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our encryption design is of our own making; no outside methods were implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bryant learned how to design an interface
Yihao learned how to encode and decode a phrase
Yan learned how develop an app on Android
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important thing we all learned was teamwork within a programming project.
We usually work on projects individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Interesting fact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some number crunching, we calculated 210 encryption returns the original phrase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cryptor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Convert the app from Android to iOS
Add more methods for deeper encrypting.
