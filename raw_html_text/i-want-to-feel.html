                    I want to feel uses visual and audio to induce the desired mindset. Simply select your desired mindset, stare at the dog, and enjoy the feeling it induces.

                    I built it entirely in html.

                    In the past 36 hours I learned that  website setup is extremely difficult. I also obtained some more command line fluency.

                    What's next for I want to feel? More emotions. Perhaps an interactive section as well.
