                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently started wanting to get into software developing and programming and I also needed to make a portfolio because I will need something to show colleges.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays who I am, my accomplishments and skills.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found a template, but I was able to edit many pieces such as the alignment, change the amount of buttons, link successfully to what I wanted to link, edit images on photoshop to put in the page and tried to figure out what the other pieces of code mean. The main thing that I was able to do was learn github which was the main goal of my time here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github was a little rough to begin with because I was confused on how repositories, commits and pulling works. However, the idea of branches and working with another person made more sense.

                <p>
                    Making the website and finishing it because I failed whenever I had started before.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to use github successfully, a good idea of bootstrap and its organizational powers, and friendship

                    Keep on adding features and changing my portfolio as I gain more experience
