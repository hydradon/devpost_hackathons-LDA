                        "Both of my parents have more than one chronic condition and receive prescriptions from multiple specialists, but since none of these physicians knows what the other is prescribing, the burden of keeping meticulous records falls on my parents. If they forget to list something, their doctor could prescribe them a medication that dangerously inhibits or intensifies something they're already taking. Even some over-the-counter medications, such as Tylenol and NyQuil, cannot be taken together because they contain the same active ingredients. Without an easy way to log medication and predict potential adverse drug reactions, patients fall into a disappointingly large group of the American population that may die from preventable causes."
