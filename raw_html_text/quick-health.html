                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of communication between doctors treating the same patient to create an application that allows a patient to communicate with their doctors and the doctors to communicate within themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick Health, contains a database that stores the patient's medical history and treatment, all doctors involved in treating the patient has access to the current treatment of the patient, the medication used, and the current condition. This allows all the doctors to have an up to date description of the patient's condition and the best course of action to take in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick Health was built using the programming language Processing as a beta app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we encountered was saving the user's data in an efficient location to allow for fast accessibility. Another was thinking of how to format the app like an actual app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the application works to its fullest intent with only 24 hours of work on it. We are also proud to re- pick up a programming language that we have not used in a year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Health
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick Health will soon become a mobile app for Android and later, IOS.
