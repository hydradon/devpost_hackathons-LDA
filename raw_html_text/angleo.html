                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After discussions with English speaking people in Montreal we pinpointed culture and language as the major factors in mutual

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An mobile app that allows the user to locate buildings and services nearby and will identify the ratings of each nearby building. User can upvote/downvote the experience with the services, and there are extra tips provided (related to the types of services the user visits) to help English speaking user learn French. Also, it has interesting historical and cultural facts about cities in Quebec so other people can learn about the wonders of Quebec. We have made a website for data visualizations and different types of graphs about the population in Quebec.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned few days ahead of time with an idea, and solidify the concept once we met up at the ConuHacks. We used many APIs, such as Google Cloud Platform, MongoDB and React-native to have support Node.js for the mobile app. The website is built based on Bootstrap with extra APIs connected for data processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us do not have any experience with JavaScript, Node.js and all the other APIs we used, so there was a lot of researched made beforehand. It took a lot longer to develop and to debug because we are such novice at it. But we learned a lot throughout this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though most of us are not experienced with this languages/frameworks we chose to use, we managed to build a functional and good-looking mobile app, along with a website for data visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of concepts and ways to implement apps in JS and other APIs that works with JS.

                    We hope to continue this project in the future and hopefully it gets used in the real world.
