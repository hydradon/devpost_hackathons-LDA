                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, personal services market (which consists of beauty &amp; wellness services) is very archaic. This industry is still stuck in mix methodology of discovery done offline via walk-in and phone call  and reservations done through a thriving partnership platform with Public APIs, which results in a highly fragmented experience for users. Through a consolidated member model and leveraging booking API&rsquo;s our platform can disrupt and modernize all aspects of this market from discovery, reservation and overall experience.

                <p>
                    We built an ios app using swift with firebase as the backend. We used Sketch &amp; Adobe creative suite to create the look and feel of the App. We even created a user survey and was able to get ~100 responses to understand user behavior and needs.

                    As a next step, we want to use partner APIs from companies such as MindBody &amp; Vagaro.
