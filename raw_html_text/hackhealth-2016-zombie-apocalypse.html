                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was always curiouos about how video games ran. Therefore, I wanted to create a video game myself, even if it was a simple text-based game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple text based game about a zombie apocalypse in Stony Brook. It was intended to be sarcastic and humorous!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used PyCharm to program the whole thing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was extremely difficult because I have no background in programming. I am currently taking an introductoy course for Computer Science (CSE 101: Introduction to Computers) Even though the class is currently covering Python, I had to teach myself a lot of information in order to be successful with my program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud that I was able to write a program this extensive. The only program that I've ever written was a "Hello, World!" program on Python as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used several YouTube videos to learn more about Python.I learned to use if and else statements, which essentially helped my goal of creating a simple game.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The possibilities are endless...It is after all an unfinished game, due to the limitless possibilities that can occur in a text-based game. I also look forward to learning knew things about programming in general!!!
