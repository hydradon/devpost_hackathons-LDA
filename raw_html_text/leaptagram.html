                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a new, interactive way to explore the urban landscape. We sought to integrate social media, which we think is a highly prominent form of communication in high-population environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leapstagram allows users to navigate over a map with gestures using the leap motion device. It supports panning and zooming. In addition, with the upward flick of the wrist, Leapstagram displays geotagged Instagram photos taken near the current location. These photos can be browsed with swiping hand gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the Leap Motion javascript SDK to pick up hand gestures, and translated these gestures into meaningful actions in our map environment. Map scrolling is accomplished via the Google Maps API, while pictures are sourced with the Instagram API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was incredibly difficult to get the hand motions right! We had to tweak sensitivity levels and introduced delays to implement some of the cooler functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leapstagram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that Leapstagram can find its way into museums and hubs of tourism, perhaps including bus stations, train stations, etc. Leapstagram is a fun and exciting way to overlay social media with the physical environment.
