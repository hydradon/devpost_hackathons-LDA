                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game, but couldn't settle on what exactly we wanted. Since we had 12 hours, we decided on a fairly basic classic RPG -- a genre now mostly forgotten, but which is our foundation of our gaming careers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an RPG... mostly. The combat is more reminiscent of an arcade shooter, but the overworld and encounters are classic RPG-style. Unfortunately, 12 hours wasn't enough to make more than the core mechanics and a single map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the project in Processing, a Java environment that includes a fairly extensive graphic library, making it easier to use for programs like graphic-based applets and the such than a typical Java compiler such as Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints were real. The core game mechanics took most of our time, so we didn't really get to add much other than one map and one scaling encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making this game at all -- some of the mechanics weren't so easy to code, especially the various screen transitions and the combat portion. Collision also posed a couple of problems, as did figuring out how to import music and loop it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project helped us with consistency in coding, specifically not making as many mistakes before compiling the program. In addition, we learned how to code tougher graphical interactions such as collisions. This project also helped us learn to enjoy ourselves when programming, something others should aspire towards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RPG ~ the RPG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're considering adding more content in the future -- more maps, more enemies, equipment, etc; make it more than just a grinding shooter, but rather something more reminiscent of a classic RPG -- with some shooting elements in there, though. Since, y'know, our limits with the turn-based combat we can code is pretty boring.
