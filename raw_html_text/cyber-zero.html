                    Neuro Virtual Reality is an environment, where user can manipulate objects by his mind. We create demo in which user can imagine and touch object. Our technologies can be implemented in VR games, becouse we make plugins and tools during work process. This technology can be used by two types of customers. The first one is patients in rehabilitation centers, becouse our technology can make therapy more effective and envolving. The second group of customers are VR-gamers who going to VR clubs, because our technology can make games more exiting.
