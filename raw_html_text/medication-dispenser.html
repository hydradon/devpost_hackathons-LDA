                    We're fortunate enough to have access to medication but in developing countries, not everyone has the same privilege that we do. Two of the four members of our group have physical medical conditions that they must take medication for. One of our members has the most common congenital heart disease, Tetrology of Fallot, and the other has Type 1 Diabetes. We want to make medication more accessible for those dealing with these common conditions and for the people with countless other needs that require medication.

                    Our project uses facial recognition to dispense medication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We began by programming our GUI for the dispenser, setting up Azure, and setting up the webcam. We had one member buy parts for the prototype and then he spent the next day building it. We started working on the facial recognition, merging the webcam, GUI, and the facial recognition into one program. We spent the last couple hours setting up the motor controllers to finalize the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges along the way. Our Telus LTE-M IoT Starter Kit was incompatible with Azure, so after many hours of attempting to make it work, we had to give up and find another way to store the facial recognition data. We started making the GUI in Python with Tkinter but after a couple hours, decided to use another module as it would be easier and look more visually appealing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team is very proud that we were able to complete our facial recognition program and prototype for the dispenser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Stepper controllers, breadboards. We set up a virtual machine, an IoT hub, and image processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to polish our prototype and actually use Azure in the program.
