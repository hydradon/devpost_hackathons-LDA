                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application that was unique to every single user and something that a wide amount of people could actually utilize. One of the most powerful displays of your personality is your music sense, and therefore having it all displayed on your wallpaper is a unique way of showing what you are all about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What WallDrop does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WallDrop is a web-based application that retrieves the 18 most listened to tracks from a user's Spotify account and combines the covers into a desktop background. The user only has to sign in to their Spotify account to download their custom backdrop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WallDrop was created using the Spotify API which extracts the user's top 18 tracks listened to and splices the album arts together to create a wallpaper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course of the project, we ran into multiple challenges, including figuring out how to merge our code into a single executable so that the user could seamlessly work without application right off the website. We also had some trouble deploying to Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WallDrop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WallDrop can be further expanded for different platforms such as MacOS and the program can be improved to complete tasks faster and more efficiently.
