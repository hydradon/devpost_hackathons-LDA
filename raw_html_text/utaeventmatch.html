                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in the same campus we hardly know anyone outside our course. We share same hobbies, passions etc but still not able to connect with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an application such that students in UTA can connect with people of their passion, exchange message and devote time together to grow their hobbies and passion together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used AWS EC2 instance as Web Server and RDS (MySQL) as database
Python was used as the backend technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we ran into was that we were new to Android programming and therefore we had to learn it from scratch while developing our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt how to develop an android project and how different APIs provided by the AWS.
