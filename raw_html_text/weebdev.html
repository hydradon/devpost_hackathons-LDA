                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to make a web app that teaches people Morse code. The back end work, however, was too much for the two of us to handle so we settled for a web app that just looks good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a webpage that features smooth JavaScript scrolling and  hand drawn pictures by Montana and photos taken by Philip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using the Ruby on rails framework with bootstrap CSS files
                </p>
                <h2>
