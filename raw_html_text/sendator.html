                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make it easier for people to stay involved in politics and contact their senators by providing fresh interfaces!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tweets at your senators with the issues you care about, with both a voice and web interface to use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Node.js. Pretty much just node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Senators aren't very kind about giving out their emails. Finding an API to use was very tough for us. We also spent quite some time looking at a bug that turned out to be the Twitter API throttling us. :/
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all works and it's easy to follow! Both interfaces are very professional and sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about how Alexa skills work and how they can be integrated with Node.js and AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sendator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll probably let you target someone and you'll have an easy way to send them tweets from the kitchen.
