                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While our interest originally stemmed from the desire to pick up basic machine learning and data analysis techniques, we loved the interdisciplinary aspect of the ViTech insurance hack, which emphasized both creating a user interface and analyzing the data itself and presenting it successfully on the UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It really challenged us to work with linking our application to backend since the challenge was so reliant on dynamically provided data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app is simple and user-friendly because we want to help you! Whether "you" are a company executive or a prospective client, we want you to clearly understand and visualize data. Our application is minimalistic and has massive potential for growth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic Client Manager is an online tool designed with the user experience in mind. We took the dataset provided by Vitech and analyzed it using various techniques, including but not limited to regressions and dimensionality reduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients can filter through and find users in the database by name, address, city, state, and/or several other fields who meet those parameters.
We created a multi-linear model in R which we implemented in Angular as an interactive Insurance Premium Predictor.
 We have also integrated beautiful visualizations of data analytics to paint a comprehensive big picture overview of 1.4 million data points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface was constructed using Angular4 with Firebase acting as our backend. We used R to create the predictive models used in our UI to estimate premium rates. Python and Matlab were used to analyze the Vitech dataset and libraries were imported into Python in order to create the visualizations.
                </p>
