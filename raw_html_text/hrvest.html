                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food isn&rsquo;t just something we eat. It&rsquo;s a part of us. It&rsquo;s the fuel that keeps us going. It&rsquo;s what helps us stay healthy or in reverse, what makes us unhealthy. However, in this rapid economy, we are more disconnected with the source of our food then ever in addition to roughly two of three U.S. adults are overweight. These are symtpohons of series health crsis. Hence we propose a solution in which gives the user power to educate themselves with their own food intake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hrvest estimates the ammount of calories in a particular food based on its image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For image detection, classification and bounding we used Google Cloud Vision API.
As for the calculation and the front-end part of the application we used Python (Flask library).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the demo to work correctly we needed some data about apples (density, average volume, etc.).
While making the calculations, we noticed that the data for apples' density didn't consider the hollow part in the fruit. That's why we needed to tweak the values so that it would correspond to the real world values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to teach ourselves how to use Flask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than that, we didn't have any serious problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout this hackathon we've learned the basics of image recognition and working with Google Cloud API. What is more, we've leveled our communication, teamwork and coding skills.
