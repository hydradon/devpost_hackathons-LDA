                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use what I learned in econometrics and build a model to predict what people want to eat. The name is a homage to Alexis Ohanian.

                    Currently, all it does is store what you ate and what you would rate it. I still am unsure of how to go about deciphering the Yelp dataset and building a model. I experimented a little using Python and Yelp's MapReduce package on the dataset through the use of AWS EMR. Got a nice basic understanding of what the package does and can find word counts/etc. Not sure where to go from here. For future explorations...

                    Actually build a decent model using regression and whatnot, hooking up to Yelp API to suggest restaurants, actually making good use of AWS EMR instead of just running simple scripts like word_count.py on it
