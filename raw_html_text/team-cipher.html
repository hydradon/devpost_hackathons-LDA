                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a large number of underprivileged children in Kenya attending informal schools which are taught by untrained teachers, reducing the quality of education. It is our desire to help a large number of the teachers acquire appropriate qualification for their position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps the teachers to save with a goal of attaining the financial requirements for registering to get the required qualification. With the saving patterns, we are able to determine their credit worthiness and advance loans to them for facilitating their studies.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the NGO at the top of the hierarchy which is willing to advance credit to these teachers, but for it to do so, it has to know the credit worthiness of the teacher. So the NGO sets up Agents (in this case the schools where the teachers teach) which will be the link between them and the teacher. These agents collect the contributions on behalf of the NGO

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the persona of the eventual users of the system (teachers) because we couldn't do a one on one interview and had to rely on information from the mentors.
