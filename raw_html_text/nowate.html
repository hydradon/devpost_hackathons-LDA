                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one likes to arrive at their favorite restaurant and find a huge line waiting for them. Even calling the establishment can be a hassle with busy nights and cranky hosts.  That&rsquo;s why we created a web application that will allow you to find the wait times of ALL of your favorite restaurants in one place!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowate.com is an application that crowd-sources data from all users at all restaurants in the area. People at the restaurant submit the number of people in their party and the current wait for that amount of people. The users at home can then input their own criteria and look for the restaurant of their choice. If the line at one is too long, they can look at another! The wait time is measured in minutes, and each submission to the website by users at the restaurant is time stamped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ubuntu 16 server (Digital Ocean), running an Apache web server with Python Flask in the back-end and HTML with JINJA2 in the front-end. Each location on the site is correlated with a view on the server,  and each view is the final product of multiple HTML files. Each form on the web page has a corresponding Ajax route that sends user data to the server where we can store, manipulate, and analyze it. We also use a mySQL database to store information. Also, we used SSL Encryption in order to protect the data of the users and secure the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was incorporating the SSL Encryption. It required a very specific process, and the tutorials and keys required to integrate the encryption were not always easy to follow and use. Also, energy was another limiting factor due to the fact that everyone stayed up all night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that everyone had their own niche in the project whether it was creating the logo or generating ideas. People sometimes forget that coding isn't all that matters when creating a software idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to brainstorm and problem-solve as well as learned how to make a great web design.

                    What's next for nowate.com?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully widespread usage and a more comprehensive database!
