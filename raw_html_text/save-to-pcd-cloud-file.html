                    The ability to store and process organized point cloud datasets &ndash; this is of extreme importance for real time applications, and research areas such as augmented reality, robotics, etc;
binary mmap/munmap data types are the fastest possible way of loading and saving data to disk.
storing different data types (all primitives supported: char, short, int, float, double) allows the point cloud data to be flexible and efficient with respect to storage and processing. Invalid point dimensions are usually stored as NAN types.
n-D histograms for feature descriptors &ndash; very important for 3D perception/computer vision applications
