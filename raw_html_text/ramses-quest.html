                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're part of the UNC eSports Club, and we decided our best skills were in game design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that built off of a custom 128mb engine called
                    <strong>
                        Pico-8
                    </strong>
                    that runs off of a severely limited version of Lua.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by learning the code and designing each level, along with it getting progressively more difficult. Eventually, it came together with a variety of features and actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into hit detection and play movement problems, which took a few hours to figure out. None of us knew Lua beforehand so there was also the challenge of learning a new programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first complete game that any of us have ever made, and we've completed it with a variety of actions so that it's fun and enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the inner workings of game development, game programming, and hacking together a mishmash of code, assets, and art from different languages and sources.
