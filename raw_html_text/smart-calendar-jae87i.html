                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that keeping track of your schedule, especially once you get into high school, was a trouble that everyone faced, and we wanted to solve that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our calendar allows you to enter your events for each day of the week and keep track of assignments. Once you insert an assignment, the calendar automatically puts it into an available time slot for when you can do it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The JavaScript was used to run the main functions of the website; the HTML created the website itself; the CSS decorated the website with colors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The highlighting a time range function was difficult and cost many hours of debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could get the highlighting to work properly and delegate the assignments to appropriate time slots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in HTML and JavaScript. Even though we knew other languages, the syntax was vastly different, so we had a little a difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Calendar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to incorporate more functions, such as dividing assignments over the course of a few days, adding music, adding cool backgrounds, and narrowing the time slots.
