                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all tired of walking around campus in the cold looking for a place to study. We would waste too much time walking around just to find no available space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Avail allows user to search for open classrooms in academic other than the library. The product allows users to reserve the room and then let other users see what occupied classrooms are being used for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html/css and javascript to build the webapp. We all collaborated over GitHub by pushing our contributions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our challenges were technical challenges. One specific and major challenge was the challenge of taking data from school website and using it to see when there is no classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design was done fast and the whole team loved it. The product is still a good collaborative tool for people looking to study together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned more html/css and javascript. We collaborated on a project over GitHub for the first time. In addition we all learned how to use firebase for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Avail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand to other schools. Add more features such as gym space and library space.
                </p>
