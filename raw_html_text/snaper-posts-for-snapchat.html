                    Such questions are perfect to discuss in groups rather than one-on-one, but how and where can we do that fast, easy, and with as many participants as possible?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've found the answer! There are 200M daily users in SnapChat. They publish, watch and response to each other stories in direct messages. These stories are actually amazing instruments for proposing interesting multi-user discussions, but SnapChat doesn't provide such functionality. Well... didn't provide, until we decided to create

                    lets you initiate a multi-user topic-oriented discussion right in a SnapChat story! It works as easy as one-two-three:

                        Create an interesting Topic for discussions and Add it to a SnapChat story

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked very hard to make it possible in just 2 days of TechCrunch Hackathon:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Designed the concept
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed the interface of the app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated SnapKIT using Swift and React-Native
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Found the right name for the app:
                        <strong>
                            Snaper
                        </strong>
                        - it has something common between Snap and Twitter; moreover, it sounds just like our favorite fish!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed the Login Page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed the feature to create and publish Posts in SnapChat
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated the posts in SnapChat with

                            Snaper

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created the database on Google Firebase
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote the perfect title, subtitle, description, and keywords for the App Store
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed the screenshots and videos for the App Store and Snap KIT Review teams
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slept a few hours, had a few meals and a few coffees

                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we decided to accomplish all our goals in such a short time we had faced controversial feelings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        we thought we were close to success
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        after we spent 2 days coding and designing the product, we thought we were doomed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        on the final morning of the event, we thought we were close to success again because we've finished even more than we planned!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It was extremely challenging to:
a) integrate Snap KIT with React-Native having basically zero documentation for that
b) do all this work using four hands only, but we've had a lot of fun because we used all the potential of our minds
                </p>
