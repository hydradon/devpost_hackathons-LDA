                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PB vs J is a game where the player runs through a randomized dungeon trying to defeat jars of jam. The game continues until the player runs out of health or time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Godot, an open-source game engine. The game will randomly choose the next room when the player exits the current room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of bug-fixing going on, so much that we unfortunately weren't able to add everything we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are new to using Godot and participating in hackathons, so I'm glad we were able to finish something on time.
