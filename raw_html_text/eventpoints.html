                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our problem started with students who have a tough time fitting into their campus community, and this app intends to fix this cultural issue on campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To do this, our app provides students with points in exchange for attendance at certain events. Events may partner with businesses so that if the user attends an event and "checks in" via the app, they earn points which can go toward an eventual redemption at a business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the proto.io framework to plan out our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted implementing it in both Android and Swift, and creating the implementation itself proved to be a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize proto.io to map out a plan for an app, and we became more experienced in the use of Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We refreshed our Java knowledge, and learned some basic Swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for EventPoints
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully completing the implementation and distributing it and promoting it at local schools to gauge the interest in such an app.
