                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often I find myself coming home from a stressful day of school just wanting to relax and play a few games of Overwatch. Yet when I find myself in game, players are too busy disrespecting each other, so I end up leaving more frustrated than when I started. Referee is here to fix that.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Referee is an automatic moderating program that can turn a toxic community into a friendly social environment for online multiplayer games.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm converts speech to text using the Google Voice recognition, then uses sentiment analysis from IBM Watson to convert their in-game behavior to one simple metric used to determine how negative a player is. Companies that use Referee can customize the software to their liking by changing the threshold value of negativity that requires disciplinary action to be taken.
