                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was inspired by the hackathon's Healthcare prompt: "Develop a video platform that pairs patients with available practitioners for virtual consultations."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doc Talk creates a Cisco Spark conversation with chat, voice, and video capabilities using the Cisco Spark web widget to allow a healthcare provider to conduct a remote consultation with patients via an online marketplace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I began by creating an OAuth application that integrates with Cisco Spark. Then I created a directory of available healthcare providers from which users can choose. Once a healthcare provider was chosen I launched an instance of the Cisco Spark web widget to facilitate the chat, file upload, voice, and video functionality between the patient's browser and the healthcare provider's Cisco Spark account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The browser demo application for the Cisco Spark JS SDK seems to be outdated as it causes an error during runtime that I could not overcome. Instead I used the Cisco Spark web widget, which worked very well.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    To try Doc Talk - follow these steps:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Login to Doc Talk:
                    <a href="https://cisco-spark-doc-talk.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow">

                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose a healthcare professional who you would like to speak with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The virtual consultation will begin momentarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the demo, the Doctors are not real so you can modify the URL to use another person's Cisco Spark account like so:
                    <code>
                        https://cisco-spark-doc-talk.herokuapp.com/?email=EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or you can try to chat with me:
