                    Sleep deprivation has become a major mental health crisis, especially among teenagers and college students, with some calling it a full-blown epidemic in younger populations. Causes of insufficient sleep vary from person to person, but what's undeniable is their impact on students: sleep deprivation can contribute to an inability to concentrate, poor grades, drowsy-driving incidents, anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide and even suicide attempts.

                    While no one app can solve this crisis on its own, we hope that Slumberpup - a Tamagotchi-esque digital companion on the Android platform - will serve as a fun way to motivate college students to improve their sleeping habits. The Google FIT API (and its sleep data) are used to calculate a "sleep score" measuring one's quality of sleep each night. This sleep score directly influences the health and well-being of the user's pet, thus providing an incentive for the user to get better-quality sleep.

                    This was our first experience with Android Studio, and while the app is still fairly rough around the edges, we're proud of ourselves for adapting to this new medium under intense time pressure.
