                <ol>
                    <li>
                        basically pair up your name with whoever you want to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        cut all the common letters, between yours and hers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        now add up all the remaining letters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now lets say you have 7 in total. starting from 'F' in FLAMES count 7. you can wrap around. you should end up at the letter 'F'. strike it out. now start again at 'L' now and count 7.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat this process until you are left with just one letter.
