                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Smart Extension Board, plug in your devices, and control via a mobile app.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Arduino Uno, ESP 8266, GSM sheild.
Server side scripting using Ruby.
Mobile app using Java and Javascript (Ionic)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to electronics, our team faced many difficulties in assembling even small things to work. 
In this process we ended up by burning 3 of our components.

                        Because of which we couldnt make Arduino communicate to web service.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make relay work. ie. We were able to control each socket on extension board using our program.
