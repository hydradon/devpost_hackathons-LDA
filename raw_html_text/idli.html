                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have different, not ideal ways of marking our tasks, from Google Keep to a paper planner. We imagined a way to visualize your tasks in a logical way, so we tried to build that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can add tasks, with features like notes and urgency. Then, you can see it on a calendar view, stacked up with all your other tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2/3 of us were new to Android, so we had to learn the basics first! Creating the calendar view turned out to be very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a button working that lets you choose a date using a pop-up calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android structure, xml, and Java!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for tempus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish the Calendar view first, then add in features like intelligent ordering of tasks and offering user-specified color categories.
