                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many professions, such as programmers, writers, graphic designers, and developers work at a desk for most of their work. It is often hard to get away from the desk as the drive to get the work done is too strong. It is not healthy. Over time this slowly cripples our body. Something counteractive has to be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is why we decided to make a web based application that will remind users when and how to do simple workouts in the office environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed our webpage with HTML, and CSS. We used JQuery to implement the fancier designs and our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we made an attempt to make a Java applet, however we faced difficulty when our JavaFX stage would either not respond or simply not refresh to a change in a node. We also had some troubles setting up a domain because of poor customer support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud as first year college students to create such a simplistic, and yet beautifully designed webpage that fulfills its purpose. We feel as though we would use it ourselves in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that programming with time constraints forces us as a team to find other alternatives. If we were persistent on a certain mindset we wouldn't be in a poor position in comparison to now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deskercize
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually we'd love to see the Java applet come onto the webpage and have more pictures relative to the exercise and/or stretch.
