                    Dear Sir/Ma'am, we would request you to watch the video we have made and attached on this page along with reading whatever we have written. We believe the video serves as a great explanation and demonstration of what we have done.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of 4 high school students who have diverse passions and want to pursue different courses such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Physics at university. We wanted to combine our contrasting interests to form a single creative and unique final product. We are all fascinated with the way Tony Stark moves his desktop with just hand gestures. We decided we would try to bring this concept to reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to control your entire laptop/ or any device a USB port with just your hand gestures. You can scroll up/down, click, switch applications, change songs, increase/decrease volume only with your hand movements in free space!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion Technology to track our hand coordinates in 3D (x,y, and z) and we used Java and the Eclipse IDE  in such a way that it could understand, receive, and store this data from the leap motion. It also corresponded certain hand/palm/finger movements from the leap motion to gestures such as a click. With leap motion libraries on top of the Eclipse IDE with Java, we provided the user with a visual interactive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, it was very tough to correspond any data received from the leap motion to gestures. It didn't help that our inexperience in coding meant that our code had a lot of errors. As beginners who were very willing and eager to learn, we scoured the net for basic guides and tutorials that made our foundations in the leap SDK and Java stronger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a final working project at the end of the 24 hours!! Moreover, what we had imagined was working to an extent with which we were satisfied with. We had managed to make our vision into a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned LOADS about coding concepts and the syntax of Java. We had never used the Eclipse IDE before so we learned quite a lot about that. Overall we were also very happy with how we managed our time and came back from our initial struggles of not getting anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Space Trackpad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two aims for the future. Firstly, we wish to make a 3D hologram of whatever is being shown on the laptop screen. This would lead to moving your applications and desktop in thin air EXACTLY like in the movies. Imagine that! Secondly, we wish to add more gestures to our code which will allow more and more to be done with just your hand. We would take advantage of the vast capabilities of the leap motion which effectively tracks palms, fingers, and fists.
