                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are you ever in the mood for a quick bite, so you walk into the Bay State dining hall at Boston University, and are overwhelmed by the amount of people? There are long lines, no available tables, and
                    <em>
                        chaos
                    </em>
                    everywhere. We've all been there, and all wished there was a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project would collect data on the amount of people in the Bay State dining hall at all times of the day. An app or website would allow users to see the amount of people in the hall compared to the maximum amount of seats that could be filled. It would also provide information about peak hours so you know what times to avoid.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How could we accurately track the amount of people in a dining hall?

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of the already existing entering / exiting system at the Bay State dining hall and used the gates to our advantage. The motion sensors can be used to count the amount of people going in and leaving, and this data will be used in our app/website.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how attempting to solve a simple problem takes a long though process, teamwork, and trial and error.

                    What's next for Don't Bawl at the Dining Hall!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If all the dining halls implement a similar entering / leaving system through gates, keeping track of the amount of people inside every dining hall finally becomes possible.
