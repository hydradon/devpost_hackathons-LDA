                <p>
                    Many people don't know enough minute details about their health to succesfully diagnose themselves, or be aware of possible disease risks, especially if they don't frequent a physician.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In theory, it would combine a series of health related API's (Infermedica, basehealth, better doctor), to compile simple human data into more medically applicable results, providing users with information on doctors near them to help with their possible ailments.
