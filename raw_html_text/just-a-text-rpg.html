                    At first I had no idea what I was going to do, but later as I thought, I personally had wanted to make a text-based RPG, it is as simple as that.

                    To be frank, at its current state, it does nothing. However, my vision is that it would be a game that I myself would want to play and I would also hope that others would like it too.

                    This was mainly built with Java, using a program called Intellij.

                    I already knew creating a game was difficult, however this experience has made me want to improve myself so I can become better than I am now. But for me, the most important thing to me was that I had fun.

                    What's next is for me to finish it on my own time. I am also deciding whether or not I should publish the game so others would have fun too.
