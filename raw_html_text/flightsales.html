                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to help people find tickets to travel locations easily by getting prices sent directly to them through their email
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and flask to create a web app that would take in the required information from the user and add them to a list that would send a weekly email containing the cheapest plane tickets to a location of their choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a new experience for our group, with everyone working with technologies that were new to them and we got to build our first attempt at a web app.
