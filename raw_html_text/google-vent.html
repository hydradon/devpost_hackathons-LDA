                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Psychology proves that a lack of human connection is one of the reasons why people feel isolated and lonely. It can often be difficult to reach out to one&rsquo;s community when you feel like you&rsquo;re the only one going through a hardship. In order to break the barrier and open the conversation, I wanted to create an anonymous chat box where people with mental health conditions can talk about their struggles openly and feel like they have a support group that understands what they are going through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way the app works is that it opens up Google Assistant which asks you how you are feeling. By the state of your answer, the google assistant puts you in group chat with up to five other people who may also be going through a similar struggle. Whether it&rsquo;s a mental health condition, abuse, addiction, family problems or a stressful day at work or school, you are not alone. It&rsquo;s time to break the barrier.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the use of Google Assistant and  Dialogflow to create the messaging interface which then adds the user into a similar chat group of people who are facing the similar struggle. The backed server is to be created using NodeJs to serve as a connection between the bot and the anonymous users.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alack of knowledge of how to build a server was a key challenge. Also not being familiar with Dialogflow served as challenge. But we were able to overcome some of these challenges by using our resources and asking mentors for assistance.

                    Other features that can be added to Google Vent to make ti more advanced is to add a feature where we ask the user whether they would like to speak with a peer or professional.
