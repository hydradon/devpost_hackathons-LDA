                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to do something to help the environment, and we love bicycles. The project was a natural fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impact Cycling is a web app allows the user to keep track of the environmental and financial benefits of their biking habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Impact Cycling using Python/Flask, SQLAlchemy, html, css, and JavaScript. We collaborated using GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered challenges in using common module versions across the team, configuring our AWS server, and learning the SQLAlchemy library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to build a working multi-user web app with a database!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many skills that will help us with future projects!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Impact Cycling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make our database system more robust, improve some of the calculations done for the user, and adding more features! Some features we would like to add are automatic logging of cycling activity (via Pebble/phone location), and some gamification mechanics. We also want to grow our user base!
