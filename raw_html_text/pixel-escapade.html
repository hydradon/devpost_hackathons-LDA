                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by online flash games of the mid-2000's, we decided to build a simple co-op puzzle game similar to those of the era.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is based around two keyboard-controlled characters that must navigate maps and environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built using Unity, and the C# code for the game was written in Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs - almost every new feature immediately caused numerous bugs that required attention.  A significant percentage of our time was spent troubleshooting Unity colliders and physics behaviors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game runs, and has 6 working puzzle levels and an infinite randomly generated race-style mode.  We are also proud that all assets, including music, sounds, and artworks, are student-created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the past 24 hours we have all honed skills involved in the game. Particularly by the end of the day we all became much more confident in our usage of tile maps in Unity, built in physics behaviors, and even colliders. From working together we were able to learn more about the minute aspects of Unity from one another and through trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pixel Escapade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the next several days, I am confident our team will day dream of new additions for our game. Already we are thinking about future levels, improved co-op opportunities, and more mechanics to make our game stand out.
