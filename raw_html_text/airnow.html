                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my family members has asthma, and after multiple summers of forest fires and watching the air quality daily to determine what outside and physical activities would be okay, I created this skill to simplify checking the current air quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the government's Air Now api to get the latest air quality data for a specific US place, city and state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote javascript to handle the voice interaction phrases and look up the zip code for a named place. I had learned that the phone apps, that I previously I would use for air checks, used the AirNow data or api, and so I found and set up access to the same api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The voice interaction was difficult to debug for a first-time skill writer.
I needed to know the user's requested location to check. The AirNow api requires a zip code, and I did not want to require the user to register their personal data with the skill. So I had to find how to lookup a location and get the correct zip code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite not registering a user's private data, using the skill is simple and quick enough for daily use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speech interaction is not simple to program.
                </p>

                    What's next for airnow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like for the skill to allow a user to register personal information to store a location to check each day and provide that information as a card for daily flash update.
I would like for the skill to cache requested location data to reduce repeat api call counts.
I would like for the skill to provide an alexa-show graphic of the air quality map for the requested location.
