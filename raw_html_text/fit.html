                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to learn how to do Android development with a focus on how the app could help my life.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically there are two buttons: tracking calories and workouts. When you hit tracking calories you get a screen asking for input, so everytime you hit that button and you will see your calories for that week. Good way of keeping out with diets and such. Then on the workouts button, it shows a list of exercises and how many cals it burns for say 1 hour, 2 hours. This will allow for maximum optimizing of workouts and calories.
