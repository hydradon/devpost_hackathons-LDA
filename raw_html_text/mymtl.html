                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the numerous sightings in Montr&eacute;al, and we wanted people to discover areas they haven't visited before. We hope this app will encourage Montrealers to go out and explore their city, alone or with friends.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A short audio clip is played that briefly describes a location and the player has to accurately guess that location by speaking back to their device. If they get it right, they will be notified, if they get it wrong, they will be told the correct response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android Studio and Nuance's Speech API. This project involved combining our knowledge about Java, Json, XML and app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get started because we were very unfamiliar with Android Studio and Nuance's API. It took most of our time to extract the information required from the generated Json file. Additionally, modifying the layout was tricky without altering any functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very satisfied with the outcome, given the amount of time we were given, and our unfamiliarity with these new tools. However, we believe we accomplished most of the tasks we wanted to do at the outset of this challenge, and we strongly believe we managed to make a cohesive application that is useful, and also enjoyable to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adapting to new environments is crucial in this field, and listening to more experienced developers is a must to progress quickly and make the most of our learning experience. The Nuance developers were especially helpful in that regard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyMTL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more locations to our application and continue to improve the interface. Additionally, we intend to allow users to input locations themselves and play against their friends. This will prolong the longevity of our app, while also benefitting the user.
