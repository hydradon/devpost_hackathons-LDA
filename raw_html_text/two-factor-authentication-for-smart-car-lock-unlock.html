                <p>
                    Prizes from the sponsors and drive to do something cool and fun and we would like 
✓ to forget our keys at home and able to unlock the car.
 ✓ to hands free unlock our car when both hands are pre-occupied with grocery bags
✓ to share our car with family and friends without worrying to hand over the keys or share the user credential

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The smart system unlock or locks the car using the smartcar api and microsoft azure cognitive services. It uses face recognition and speech passphrase for authentication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the user can unlock the car by looking at the camera followed by saying the user set passphrase.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the python api for smartcar to get access and control the smartcar systems(with user approved privilleges) and integrate a real time face recognition and speech recognition microsoft azure cognitive services for dual authentication.

                <p>
                    The project provides an interesting proof of concept prototype for hands(and offcourse password free) free two factor authentication system which could be ported to any Iot compatible system or maybe a mobile app with little effort (could be more based how well the job is done)

                    Azure cloud service and Smartcar API usage for easy development of 'ready to deploy' service.
