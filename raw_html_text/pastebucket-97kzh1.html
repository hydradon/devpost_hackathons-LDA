                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many times that we need a place to copy and paste something and send to a friend, teammate, or our other devices. All other services were not good enough for us for reasons like not having image support or huge lack of privacy. So we made one for our selfs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a decentralized copy and paste sharing that works over blockchain technology and encrypts everything, so there is no way for anyone that can be evil!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it with implementing an open protocol on top of Blockstack API, adding more layer of encryption, and after that put it in a nice interface to provide a very pleasant experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defining a secure and decentralized way to create, share and edit pastes without sacrificing user experience, and on top of that, see paste service with new eyes to give users a new and better tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping it nice and easy along the industry standard security so no one can be evil.
