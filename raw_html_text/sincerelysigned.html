                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to target and fix a problem facing our society today. Currently, deaf people or those using American Sign Language have trouble communicating with the general population simply because ASL is not a widely taught language. We aim to fix this issue with SincerelySigned. We want to make it possible for those using ASL to be able to freely communicate with everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program, SincerelySigned, helps deaf people communicate with people that may not know sign language. Through our program, a person using ASL can sign towards the Leap Motion Controller, and our program would be able to decipher that into text for the other person to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project utilizing the Leap Motion Controller, and the Leap Motion API. We created a python code that would analyze the hand movements and be able to identify which ASL sign the user was indicating and be able to output the corresponding letter in text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few of the challenges we ran into initially were setting up the Leap Motion controller, and installing the correct drivers and corresponding programs. In the beginning, our Leap Motion Airspace simply was not responding to the sensors inside of the controller. After recalibrating our controller, we were able to solve this issue. Another issue we came across was that the computer identified the motion controller as a camera instead of an imaging device thus not allowing us to install the correct drivers. After scouring the internet for over an hour we came across the solution to this issue.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated above, our biggest accomplishment was overcoming the obstacles we faced in the connection of our Leap Motion Controller. After solving the connection issues, and figuring out how to compile and run our code on the controller we were able to debug and improve the code to what it is today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we were able to learn a multitude of things ranging from how to install correct drivers, to learing how the Leap Motion Controller works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SincerelySigned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to improve the controller's accuracy and make sure it can identify every letter and number in the American Sign Language alphabet. Once we accomplish this we also want to focus to text to voice, essentially giving deaf people a chance to voice their opinions.
