                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of people every day throughout the world that are affected by natural disasters. I think it's very beneficial to find information about storm shelters or safe places as soon as possible to avoid risking loss of life or limb.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will pull your Longitude and Latitude, and give a list of nearby firestation's, church's, storm/bomb shelters, and hospital's that are hosting shelters for the neighboring community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Google Map's API that I configured to work with Javascript. I also used Ionic to build and host the app, and Cordova to display our current location as well as the shelters around our area (although I wasn't able to implement this)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Google Map's API to work correctly and allow use of their system was a huge pain. I was getting countless different error messages after I made any changes, but with some dedication and LOTS of research I was able to successfully implement the API into this app. I was also having issues with Cordova, and I waited until it was too late to try and make any changes. I didn't realize this but Cordova only runs on simulations of IOS/Android, and I wasn't able to get the simulations to work (besides the web browser).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am
                    <em>
                        very
                    </em>
                    proud of my accomplishment with successfully setting up Google Map's API along with Ionic. This was the first time I have ever worked with an API, and overall I think it went well. I would say that took some of the longest time to configure properly. I'm also proud of my determination to finish this project even though it wasn't complete.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to implement an API with an app SDK successfully. I also learned how to allow and disallow certain HTTP/IP addresses from accessing my API key.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm definitely going to go home and work on this project until it is complete. I feel like I have a very good idea of what I need to implement for it to be fully functional, and I really do think that this could help people around the world.
