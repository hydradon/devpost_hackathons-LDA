                    Yesterday we chose to participate to Ekino&rsquo;s challenge. We felt very passionate about the idea. We wanted to develop a game very exciting. A game we would love to play together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an atmosphere of stress and nervousness like the feelings you have during the season finale of your favorite TV show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this idea in mind we imagined Bluffer. A game where you don&rsquo;t know your allies, nor your enemies. 
Earning points for your team becomes a real challenge when you don&rsquo;t want your opponents to find out anything about you. 
Each player has to answer questions, but the points may not be given to his team. This way you have to adjust your answers, without being suspicious. Be careful, you don&rsquo;t want your opponents to denounce your team to win the game. Because you&rsquo;re points would mean nothing.
