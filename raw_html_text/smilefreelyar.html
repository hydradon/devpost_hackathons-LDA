                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While racking my brain for a viable and useful AR app, I remembered an experience during my travels in South America. While there, I met a family who had a child with a cleft lip. I remembered that made an impression on me because I knew that in the Northern Hemisphere, a cleft lip is easily preventable. That gave me the inspiration for this AR app. If people could see what a cleft lip looked like on themselves maybe they could relate to the plight of young children who lack the resource to have the corrective procedure and may be more inclined to donate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses an AR filter to superimpose a cleft lip on a user. When the user smiles the cleft lip disappears. We have a facebook messenger application to direct users to our filter and can be used for charities world wide.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application with Spark AR and Facebook Messenger. We also used a self signed SSL certificate because we could not afford to buy a certificate. So when you click it, be assured you can trust us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were that we were not significantly experienced with Messenger or the newly released SparkAR. It was a challenge to learn the technology quickly and integrate it. We also had to learn some basic 3D modeling to customize our face mesh to properly render a cleft lip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud to master the necessary concepts and technologies and more importantly integrate them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned SparkAR,  Facebook Messenger, 3D modeling and AR principles.

                    What's next for SmileFreelyAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for SmileFreelyAR is to refine our facemesh to work better with all kinds of faces and maybe making more filters to highlight preventable cranofacial defects.
