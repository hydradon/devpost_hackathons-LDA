                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TeaLatte Bar is a local bubble tea spot that I visit a few times a week for light and refreshing drinks during study sessions. They recently opened for business a couple of months ago and I love all of their drinks. TeaLatte Bar has a huge emphasis on their drinks being made fresh from steeping tea leaves, no powder additives, and healthy sweetener substitutes. They also offer 2 different tea samples everyday, high speed internet, and excellent service to my community. I would like to make an attempt to make a website for them, and I am not affiliated with TeaLatte Bar.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a static website that has a home, about, menu, and location page. It has a carousel feature that uses bootstrap and jquery. Basic HTML and CSS concepts were used throughout each page. Also has embed GoogleMaps.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it on vacation (still traveling as I type) with a few hours a day. I came up with a simple design after watching some tutorial videos and watching Colt Steele's web dev lessons on udemy. The technologies I used were HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Git, jquery, and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Headers, I spent hours trying to understand why my HTML headers were so different in the index page compared to the others. Turns out when I finally gave up on it, AWS processed it perfectly. I also ran into issues understanding specification order in CSS, tough to know which element takes precedence over others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! Specifically since this was my first time doing any web dev, I was really happy to try my hand at HTML, CSS, git, and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is easy, CSS is really fun but difficult to grasp because of so much specification when it comes to priority of different elements. AWS is really simple, I'd recommend it to anyone that wants something up and running at a really low price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeaLatteBar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I definitely want to go back to fix some things and try to make it better. Then once I'm finally happy with the product, I'm going to offer it up to the actual TeaLatte Bar, for free.
