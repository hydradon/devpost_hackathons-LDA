                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to understand how artificial intelligence operates, as well as observing its strengths and weaknesses. This could not be better exemplified by the algorithm we built which plays video games. We seek to show the way artificial intelligence learns from its mistakes in order to improve itself. We gave the name Artificial Idiot to the project, in part as a play on words over the acronym of artificial intelligence (AI), but more importantly to highlight the fact that in the present day artificial intelligence cannot operate on par with human interaction.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm learns to play simple games. With raw images being the input, the AI would interact with the game in the same way a human would.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main techniques we used include Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The code is written in Python and CNN is built by PyTorch.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We reaffirm our aspirations that artificial intelligence will improve its performance by learning from its mistakes. We would also push for compatibility with more complex video games. We hope that in the near future we can create a new algorithm which would show a significant improvement to the AI so poor T-Rex does not get so beat up!
