                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed dances and parties as a way to socialize, but I don't have any smooth moves, so I always ended up just swaying awkwardly in a corner. After watching a talented friend of mine rock Just Dance, I had the idea for this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It recognizes what song is playing, pulls the choreography from the Just Dance Youtube channel, and displays it in front of your face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Google Glass developer kit and a music recognition library, ACR Cloud, to recognize what song was playing. I then used the YouTube data API to find the video based on the song title and artist.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        WiFi interference prevented me from setting up the Glass until Saturday.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Software:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The YouTube player library for Android doesn't work on the Glass because the Glass doesn't have the YouTube app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The GDK is outdated, since the Glass was discontinued, and the libraries for displaying video are unreliable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I came into this project not knowing how to make Android apps, so it was an interesting experience to try to learn how Android works while trying to make something useful.
