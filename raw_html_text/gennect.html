                <p>
                    Discussing as a group we realized that as college students there are many possible win-win exchanges we could have with elderly people. We believe youth in general struggle with key soft skills that are vital for their success. Given the prompt to aide the elderly with social isolation we chose to create opportunities for these exchanges.

                <p>
                    Using a detailed questionnaire we create suggested matches for youth with elderly that are looking to teach key soft skills. We then help facilitate the relationship between the two using features such as chat, voice chat, by suggesting and creating activities.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While tackling the backend we stacked on many new technologies along with learning to manage a new workflow. The backend team implemented the chat application for example separate from the UI. This implementation worked with persistence using a MongoDB database although when it came time to integrate the solution with the UI we were short on time and not able to quite get it to work.

                <p>
                    We learned technical design skills, new technology stacks, as well as team working skills such as compromising with conflicting ideas and incorporating differing skillsets.

                <p>
                    We want to approach private retirement homes, high schools, as well as colleges to pitch and validate our idea. On the technical end, we want to finish implementing key features such as the chat, voice chat, and the activities tab.
