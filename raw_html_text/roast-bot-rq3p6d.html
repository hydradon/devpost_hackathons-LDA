                    What inspired us?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by r/roastme, which we actually used
                </p>

                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an image captured by the user's webcam and compare's their face to faces posted on Reddit's r/roastme. From there, we will return the top-rated comment (determined by upvotes and comment score)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Who worked on what?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zachary and Noah worked on the front-end/ui for the app. Isaiah worked on building the API with AWS. 
Angela contributed to all parts of the project, which was impressive because this was her first hackathon! She learned skills in HTML, python, and we were all amazed at the speed at which she learned these new technologies. Isaiah implemented docking.

                <h2>
                    What bugs did we encounter?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS seemed to have a lot of bugs, and the documentation was not very good at finding how to fix the bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we learn?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use aws as a backend and use atlaskit for front end components. We learned how to efficiently compare faces and how to scrape reddit for posts.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Roast Bot?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to scrape more posts for Roast Bot, and users need to use like/dislike to improve the quality of roast to improve the accuracy of roasts.
