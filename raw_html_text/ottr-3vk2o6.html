                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our app primarily came from other popular gamification apps such as carrot that utilize a rewards system to encourage users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our App offers the ability to connect with friends and family and gain points for spending time together as well as participating in event promotion on the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used team sharing on Figma (a web-based UX design platform) to create a prototype for the app as well as worked with NodeJS and IOS in an attempt to create a semi-functional version of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was only a single developer on our team, making it difficult to build the full application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the polish we managed to achieve with our prototype and developing, a useful application for older adults to connect with younger populations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork and assigning specific role within our group as well as collaborating with each other to build off of our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ottr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is to finalize the working version of the app as well as add some extra functionality which would allow for older adults to post help listings which could be completed by others for additional points.
