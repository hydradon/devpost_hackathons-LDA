                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of food waste at restaurants, events, college dining commons, you name it. What if there's a way to donate that food to people who need it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neighborhood Nibbles allows people to donate leftover food by posting what food they have left. Anyone can find amazing food that would otherwise have gone to waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Jawsdb, and Bootstrap to create our amazing demo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have very proud that we were able to collaborate in such a short time to solve a real problem using the knowledge and skills we have.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Push/email notifications, geolocation to filter posts by the user's distance, mobile app, social aspect which, for example, can connect a homeless shelter to a nearby restaurant that has leftovers often, and more!
