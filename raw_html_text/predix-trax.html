                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks and monitors Model T's and other assets with, temperature, humidity  and, GPS location, it may also send alerts via text. There is also a camera function to view the asset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript to access the API's. We also used Predix and a Rasberry Pi as web and apache servers. Then we got a Raspberry pi camera to continually take pictures of the assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our challenges include learning javascript and learning predix the day of the hackathon, understanding the API's for google maps and using and putting together the Model T data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the team that came together and the web app that we've made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned at least one new language for each of us. We also learned to look at how to use the languages and hardware in different and creative ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Predix Trax
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will continue to keep in touch and make more web apps that could change how companies or even the world works.
