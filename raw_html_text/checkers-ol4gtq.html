                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop a game that is similar to checkers and gain practice with both paired programming and arrays in C++
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implements command-line game interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming in C++ using git to backup
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging, implementing capture functionality, avoiding crashes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to resolve many compilation issues that plagued our project in the early stages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementations of even simple games can be MUCH harder than they first appear--this will be good preparation for implementing Euchre in EECS 280
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Checkers++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, graphics would be improved and perhaps an app would be developed
                </p>
