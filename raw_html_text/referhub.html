                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java on Android studio and used the Firebase database API for user authentication and storing coupon codes of the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Database storage turned out to be quite a challenge as our real time values we're failing to react with Async methods of the Database's API. Another challenge we ran into, was understanding the behavior and characteristics of the users and creating a common category for each of them.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the user authentication right after a long tussle and managed to filter coupon codes of the user and come up with an easy way to manage them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReferHUB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning on launch an iOS app (hey, we don't discriminate!) and are also looking into making seamless integration of coupon codes into the apps and timely deletion of expired codes.
