                    Executive Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leaving prison and re-entering the community is a major transition. The correctional system doesn&rsquo;t establish the appropriate connections for ex-inmates to new employment, abstinence from drugs, strong relationships and crime-free living. No easy way exists to help men transitioning out of prison harness the tools of self-care and avoid recidivism. This is a problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development of the Launch mobile app is centered around solving, "How might we help men transitioning out of prisons and jails harness the tools of self-care to avoid recidivism." The theme of "transition" guides the development of this app. For populations like this, transition periods are often fraught with challenges that need to be overcome while the individual is searching for the help they need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to make that transition easier by putting the services and supports needed by the population at their fingertips. In doing so, we hope to capitalize on a time of high levels of personal activation and solidify the positive feedback loop, ultimately getting a person the services they need more quickly and reducing their chances of going back to prison. 
Our app will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Incorporate the newest available app technology, using "voice to text" and natural language processing (siri API)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable self-care by enabling individuals to express the challenges they are facing in a supportive, private environment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Minimize the anxiety and fear associated with this transition by providing individuals with a short and actionable list of targeted solutions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give individuals the tools they need to take steps forward to make change
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Target Audience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is designed for men leaving prisons and jail, and transitioning back into the community. Over 600,000 men are released from prison each year and 2/3 are re-arrested within 3 years (60% are African American and Hispanic). Studies have shown that while the time after release is fraught with problems, it also "offers an opportunity to capitalize on most people's strong desire to turn their lives around." It is at this time, when an individual is at their highest level self-activation, that we want to help him find the services and support he needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How our app works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When an individual opens our app, he's prompted with a simple screen asking him, "how are you doing"? The individual then responds to the question using a voice recording. Based on the app's analysis of the language used in the response, the app offers possible options of ways to help the individual with what he needs. For example, if a person were to say, "I'm feeling lonely", the app would then offer resources like AA meetings, churches, and support groups, based on that person's geographic location and the information they provided during a short on-boarding.

                    Business Model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monetization - The app is purchased on the ex-offenders behalf by:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        State and regional prison systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managed care organizations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sheriff's offices and local law enforcement systems
Second potential option - Organizations that would like to be included on our app can pay to be listed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Distribution - The app is downloaded during:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Discharge planning in prison/jail
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During the initial visit with the MCO provider or case manager
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the first meeting with the parole officer
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Launch Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will launch this app initially in a pilot with a supporter state, like Illinois. After a successful pilot, we will open this up to other correctional systems, non profits supporting ex-offenders, and managed care organizations caring for individuals leaving the prison system. During this time we'll be collecting metadata that will then be packaged and sold to organizations wanting to study and understand the needs of this group of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Sustainability Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuous use by current users:
One benefit of this app is the way it enables parole officers or MCO care managers to monitor their parolees and quickly triage who is most in need of assistance. In marketing this app, we'll emphasize to the individuals leaving prison that the app, while private, can also help you stay in touch with your parole officer and the services you need. The app will also prompt the user with a reminder each day, then taking them to the landing page, and asking the individual, "how are you doing?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scaling to new populations: 
We plan to use this basic model to open this app up to other populations in transition who are in need of services, such as youth aging out of the foster care system, women leaving domestic violence situations, and women transitioning out the of the prison system.

                    Competitive landscape:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our search of the landscape, we found that most apps in this space are geared towards the time that individuals are in prison to connect them to their families or allow them to send money. We were not able to find any apps that were geared towards individuals after they left the prison system. Our app would be the first in the market. Additionally, we provide ease of use and quicker connection to services.
