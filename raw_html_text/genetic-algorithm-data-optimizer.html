                <p>
                    A shop keeper has 5 departments in their store and a certain amount of inventory available that must be distributed as efficiently as possible throughout
the 5 departments depending on the demand from customers. The demand for each department can be entered as a percentage at the start of the program (must 
add up to 100% total). The cost of production of the inventory item per item as well as the selling price can be added. The goal of the program is to find
the closest to optimal supply distribution based on customer demand in order to maximize profits. Having an excess or lack of product in the face of customer 
demands will lead to a loss of potential profit.

                    Note: For the sake of our simulation, we make the assumption that there is a maximum of 1000 inventory items and they all cost the same to produce (5$ per item) as well as to sell (15$ per item).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The genetic algorithm uses a "breeding" system which takes 2 random "parent" objects to create a third "child" object with similar values of the parents, however
a slight random variation is added. This is repeated multiple times until a specific sample size is achieved, from which we eliminate the objects that do not 
have values close to what the program desires, leaving behind the most "successful children" behind for further breeding. By reiterating this process several 
times, we create several generations of "children" which are better than the previous (meaning they have values closer to what we desire). These new values which
are close to the value we desire will provide us with the information we need. For a more precise result, we can decrease the size of the random variation, this 
would in turn cause the program to take longer to reach a point where the user would be satisfied as it there would be only be small variations every generation.
The amount of inventory items per department was displayed in html5 canvas every time a new "child object" was created.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally planned to do an Internet of Things project that had nothing to do with this program, however after running into a series of issues we decided a change of plan was needed.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, we faced a lot of issues with our original IoT idea, and so we ended up changing tracks quite late, around 10pm, 11 hours after the hackathon had started. We ended up completing a working model and experienced the highs and lows of an unsuccessful and then successful design process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the program would peak at certain values over time in one simulation but slightly different values in another simulation. Although I'm not exactly sure why this happens, I believe it's due to the random variation starting with a large increase in specific values by chance, leading to different peaks for every simulation.

                    What's next for Genetic Algorithm Data Optimizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By switching values in the program such as the cost of production, selling price, supply and demand, with real world datasets, we can optimize sales for use in the work world. For example, The cost of production and selling prices of inventory items can be modified to be specific per department, thus making the goal of the program to allocate the optimal amount of funds in each department. Although this program is far from being perfect, it demonstrates a working example of a simple machine learning algorithm in one of its many applications to the real world.
