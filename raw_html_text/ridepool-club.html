                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to make possible for people share their rides comfortably with people they can know in advance. Due to this, the app allows them creating their own club or belong to others in order to arrange rides and go in a full car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows people to:
-Create or take part of a club. Sending requests or invitations.
-Arrange a ride. Applying for or accepting requests.
-Go full car. Checking in your ride to find the driver and riders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have built it following MVC standard using Objective-C and some libraries such as MapKit, CoreData, AddressBook and AFNetworking. On server-side, the techs used were Java, Hibernate, Spring Security and My SQL as database. All communication between the app and server was done through json.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was my first application, which made me passionate for mobile. Thus, every part of it was a huge challenge. However, the less enthusiastic part was to set up a Linux Server to run Tomcat. It would be a monstrous effort but for Amazon Web Service, which makes all those infrastructure tasks easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a matter of fact, an important challenge I had to tackle was the communication between server and the app, which I believe might be improved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, it is important to emphasize that this app used many posts of GitHub and the majority of the icons is of icon8.com.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I am certain that many could be done to make this app perfect, I recognize it was a challenge that I have overcome as I had to act alone in a full-stack endeavor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have gained many practical knowledge, specially those related to the difficulties of build an entire application using server-side database.
