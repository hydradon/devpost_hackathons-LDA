                    <strong>
                        Bad Donations
                    </strong>
                    When everyone lines up in front of hospitals to send blood to hurricane victims, most of this blood never gets to the victims and expires. However, hospitals need blood periodically throughout normal times, when most people don't donate.
                </p>

                        Good Donations
                    </strong>
                    This is a website that allows users to sign up and receive a text whenever hospitals near them run into a lack of blood. 
It also has Alexa app for portability and accessibility for the users; hospitals also may search if there are any hospitals nearby that have excess blood packets and/or send notifications to users in case of urgent need for blood donations.

                        Languages and APIs
                    </strong>
                    We built this using React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Twilio, and finally the Google-Cloud-Platform. 
Alexa is built using Node on AWS lambda, uploaded on AWS S3, and is connected with Firebase and Twilio.

                    <strong>
                        Time Constraint
                    </strong>
                    We really ran into a problem of lack of coordination at the start. People were working on parts of the project we had already decided weren't necessary. But over time, we came through this and began dividing the work efficiently in order to get the project done on time. 
Moreover, after finishing off the code for google home mini, we realized NYU wifi is not compatible with google home mini, thus we had to start over with Alexa. Getting modules to connect properly on AWS lambda was also a struggle.

                        Saving Lives
                    </strong>
                    We're proud to have completed this project because if enough people sign up, we can make a difference and actually save lives. Smart donations could be the future of donations, and people will live better because of it.

                    <strong>
                        Strategy
                    </strong>
                    We primarily learned to figure out before starting a project who should work on what, and how we're going to build a project. This is important to prevent meaningless work and quicker progress towards the MVP.
