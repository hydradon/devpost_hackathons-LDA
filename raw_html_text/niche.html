                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I created Niche to fill a certain void left by today's social media. In my attempt to connect with people that I care about using popular social media platforms, I find myself disconnected from my immediate surroundings. While the occasional 'Meme for Cold AF Teens' manages to squeeze a chuckle out of me, the ever random concoction of videos, pictures, and memes that have become a staple of these social media has created a longing for the people and happenings right next to me. Although I cannot claim to know what the future holds for Niche, I hope that it serves as a platform that brings together a small community. To strengthen their bonds by finding their niche.

                    It is a social media platform that connects people with common niche interests within an area.
