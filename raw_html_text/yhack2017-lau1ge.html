                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever Ubered/Lyfted from your college campus to the airport for break? And how many of those times were you alone? Every school break, thousands of college kids flock to the airports all at the same time. But they don't know who else to coordinate sharing Uber, Lyft, and other carpooling services with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app resolves the problem by matching users with similar flight times, so that they can coordinate Ubering or Lyfting together to the airport (or wherever else they'd like). This can reduce the cost by more than half for each person!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 1. Give Your Travel Plans:
Provide Migrate with the day you plan to fly out of an airport near campus, as well as the earliest and latest times in the day you can leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 2. Merge and Coordinate:
Migrate will alert you whenever another student has an overlapping shared ride with you. When at most 6 people match, a groupchat will start and you can take it from there! You can also view all existing trips on the website.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using Google Cloud Services. We integrated Google App Engine and Facebook login to get accounts up and running.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was by-far setting up the database. We were unfamiliar with Google's version of relational databases and how to represent them, so the learning curve was sharp. Eventually we got the bare bone application working, but with the sacrifice of missing styling. And that's because we're a team of two!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that we conquered the technologies we sought out to use (besides Facebook). Neither of us had used Bootstrap before, despite writing other websites from scratch. And we now feel comfortable just-starting a web app using Google Cloud Platform
