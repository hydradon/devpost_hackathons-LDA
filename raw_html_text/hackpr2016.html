                    In order to help others (and by others we mean high school students mainly) in their time of need we worked hard 24 hours full of coffee in our blood. This application called MathHack provides the users a fun text based program so that they can practice basic pre-calculus problems to further develop their success.

                    Aside from hard work for over 24 hours the program whole was created during the hackathon of HackPR where we created 19 classes these classes consist of the many features in the program, to name a few we created exercise generators responsible for (you guessed it!) generating exercises with random number generators in order to provide a never ending examples of math problems. Other features created include the many menus, history and even difficulty for the game so that even the most experienced mathematicians can have fun playing such a fun game.

                    The whole program is made by using java.
