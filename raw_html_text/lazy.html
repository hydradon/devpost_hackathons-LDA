                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people are motivated by loss instead of gain - when someone knows that they can gain a reward, no matter how big it is, they'll still have the chance to put it off. But by showing them their losses, they are instantly motivated, because they are devastated with regret instead, and have no choice but to immediately change to make sure that they don't do the same mistake again. Lazy uses this philosophy to enhance the productivity experience and make a unique app unlike the thousands of other productivity apps out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This psychology has also been proven with through a topic in economics and decision theory, called loss aversion. Loss aversion studies also suggest  that losses can be twice as powerful as gains psychologically.

                <p>
                    Lazy is a simple one touch app. There are 2 modes to it - Work and Slack mode. All you need to do is tap the screen to switch modes, and Lazy will start recording the exact amount of time you are working or slacking off, and then presents it visually in a unique pie chart to show how much of the day you spent working or wasting time. There's also a motivation button at the button that will present fun quotes when tapped. Unlike normal productivity apps, these quotes will scold the user for not working in order to ensure the philosophy of motivation by loss.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xcode and Firebase to build the iOS app, and also built a mini web version companion as well.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Certain animations were tricky to figure out such as the way the graph animates to fill up based on the different time values. Firebase was also tricky to get it working cross-platform.
