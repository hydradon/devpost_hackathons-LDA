                    Locare is an application that allows users to display their status and/or interests to other people from different locations. It is stored with a SQL database by recent activity, so the users can refresh to see a new group of people in which they want to talk to, based on interests and/or proximity to their current location, thereby allowing users to connect to others locally as well as around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio (Java and XML), PHP, SQL, Linode for the hosting server to store the database, and Github for version control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To facilitate the development of the application, we used storyboarding to visualize the interaction between different elements and the connection between front end and back end elements within the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without much prior experience to PHP and SQL and with lots to discover as our first hackathon, we made some progress but not as much as expected, though we have a working implementation of the application. This application can be expanded to include groups based on similar interests to effectively connect users globally.
