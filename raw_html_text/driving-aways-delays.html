                    ## Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the goal of finding ways to help improve Toronto's transit system, we analysed the relationship between TTC bus delays, weather and ridership data. After exploring the datasets we built time series and machine learning models to analyse the causes and predict future delay incidence. From our investigation we came up with actionable insights that could be used to minimise bus delays in Toronto.
