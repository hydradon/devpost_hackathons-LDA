                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came to us from the company Terma which presented their case on the hackathon. They wanted to present a 3D audio system to a customer so they could feel and understand how it works and the importance of it to for example fighter pilots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a virtual arena with projectiles rushing their way to attack the player with the player receiving accurate 3D audio which indicates to him where the projectile is coming from and allows him to use his occulus touch bound shield to block this projectile. The game has a scoring and life system which rate the player based on how good his blocking is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to go for a technology we had never used before,namely unity3d and the oculus rift development kit provided by Terma.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our challenges were many. Our first challenge was  getting used to the VR reality and to the way one programs  this new horizon. We had multiple challenges in this department,from location tracking and positioning of elements through the usage of 3D sound and the adaptation of a whole new ideology regarding interfaces when it comes to VR. We also had to deal with issues regarding the position and output of given position by the occulus touch controller and its rotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get virtual reality and our VR arena running with technologies we had never used before until friday and we managed to figure out most of our introductory challenges to VR which is certainly a reason to be proud of oneself.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one we learned that we are a bit too ambitious with our initial plans and that things can go wrong very quickly but that we are also capable of dealing with an entirely new environment and manage to create something to be proud of in such a short time frame.
                </p>

                    What's next for Audio Visuallly Enhanced Reflex Yard - AVERY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to get our hands on an occulus development kit and a VR ready device in the future to see if we can push this concept into an actual software to be used by companies for showcases to their customers but we will have to see.
