                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always seen distant buildings while driving along Texas and always wondered where that building was so maybe I could go visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Skyline uses trignometry , magneometers, acclerometers m and Google Services to identify buildings at any distance. It does this by calculating how far the building is where you are facing and then using Google to draw the position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Play Services wouldn't work so I had to use the deprecated library for location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It worked in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Android Studio, I didn't have any experience with the program prior to this event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Skyline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use ArcGIS to query elevation and building data to refine results and simplify user experience. Didn't do this because the license is $5,000 and the free trial requires credit card information.
