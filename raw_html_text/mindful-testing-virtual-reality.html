                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research has shown that test-taking anxiety can affect kids starting in kindergarten right up through graduate school. Tests are a fundamental part of education, yet there has been little innovation in (1) re-imagining what testing looks like through technology, and more importantly, how technology might help to address test-taking anxiety. According to NYU, 49% of students surveyed reported feeling a great deal of stress on a daily basis. A substantial minority, 26 percent of participants, reported symptoms of depression at a clinically significant level.

                <p>
                    Rather than mimicking a traditional classroom, Mindful Testing Virtual Reality (MTVR) places the user into a more relaxing, virtual beach environment. Before testing begins, MTVR guides the user through a simple meditation known as square breathing. After this is completed, the formal assessment is initiated. In this current demo, the course subject is geometry and is explored via 3D object identification. Placed along the beach, the user is asked to correctly identify figures such as cubes, cones, and cylinders.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We utilized Unreal Engine to build the experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Audio was self-recorded and made via GarageBand
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Non-technical:
We first conducted preliminary research on a wide range of topics including test-taking, anxiety, meditation, virtual environments, and course content. Next was constructing an experience roadmap of what the user would see sequentially, along with visual mockups of the shapes, breathing exercise, and environment.
