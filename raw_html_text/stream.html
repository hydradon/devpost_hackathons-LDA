                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People want to converse more water but don't know where to start or keep track and don't have the motivation to continue with their efforts.
                </p>

                    The Customer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carl Domingo works a 9 - 5 job and has 2 kids and a wife. He wants to care for the environment but never puts in all of his effort because he has so much other stuff keeping him busy in life. Carl wants something that is cheap, easy to install, and can keep track of his water consumption and compare to his community and city as a whole. Carl also wants to keep track with friends to motivate him and better society as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An affordable, easy to install solution to keep track of and aid in water conservation. Our solution represents a much cheaper and more efficient finalized product. It hooks onto sources of water and uses a flex sensor and Spark Core Arduino chip to measure water usage and records it to a influxdb database. The data is then used in the iOS app where it is presented to the user in simple and intuitive interface. The user can then use the app to track their progress, compete with friends, and keeps track of the progress as a community.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Spark Core chip turned out to be very unreliable and would drop signals, constantly disconnect from wifi, and we were not be able to directly program onto the device and had to use their cloud to deploy and compile our code. 
The standard HTTP request library on the Spark Core chip strips request query parameters.
                </p>
