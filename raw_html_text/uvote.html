                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be interesting to analyze voting data of Congress because of the important election cycle coming up. In particular, young people tend not to stay up to date with political news, so giving them a platform to judge candidates seemed useful. With that said, this website would serve as a means of overcoming the gap in knowledge for voters world-wide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are allowed to drag sliders that characterize their position on important issues that were voted on by real Senators from the past 4 years. Then, we list the most similar Senators and a map showing their regionalistic similarity.

                <p>
                    Scraping is hard!! (Responsive) web design is also hard!! Integrating Beaker and Linode is EXTREMELY hard, but the volunteers at hackathons are amazingly nice.
