                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many software engineers and hackers, I spend a lot of time coding, often neglecting physical activities for long stretches at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed an app which works with Walabot and Alexa to both keep track of how long you've been sitting and give visual cues when its time to take a stretch break. Walabot tracks how long you've been sitting at the desk and updates a database with the last time you moved. I designed a companion Alexa skill that can answer questions such as 'How long have I been working?" and it will update you with the time you last moved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python, Amazon Alexa Skills Kit, AWS Lambda, ngrok, Walabot, Rasbperry Pi, LEDs, soldering, and a 3D printer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had difficulty with the socket module in python. Particularly with error 98, address already in use. I also had difficulty with the LEDs. I originally wanted to use RGB 12v leds and have color variation based on the length of time since last movement, but I couldn't work out the power issue and had to revert to white 5v LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of this whole project. Nearly all of it was new territory for me; this is my first Alexa Skill and my first time with client and server sockets. I've learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to power and control items using the Raspberry Pi's GPIOs. I learned how to read a circuit diagram. I learned how to connect my Raspberry Pi to my Alexa. I learned how to work with Walabot. I learned how to create servers with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Take a Break with Walabot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more functionality to the Alexa Skill so it can start and stop the Walabot tracker. I would like to add a speaker to add audio cues if the visual cues aren't followed. And I would like to solve the power issue with the 12v RGB leds.
