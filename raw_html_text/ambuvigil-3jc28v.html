                    The inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from an article in the New York Times about how NYC sidewalks are not friendly for people in wheelchairs. It is a website where users can view and upload information about blockages on sidewalks to help wheelchair users and others navigate the city.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 along with CSS in netbeans.
                </p>

                    Challenges:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into is we didn't know how to make sections and format the website how we wanted. Another challenge is we had to pick one idea of the many we came up with. The biggest challenge we had was trying to add an API to the website. Every time we did it broke our code so we didn't add it but in the future we will.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud that we even built a functioning website. We love the styling and how it all looks and the   drop down menus look along with how text change color when you hover and many other things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ambuvigil:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to keep updating our website and add API's to it so it's more user friendly. We can one day turn it into an app so its available on mobile devices.
