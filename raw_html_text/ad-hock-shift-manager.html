                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Big companies like CVS, Walgreen maintain their pharmacist work schedule through a centralized process. So when one employee takes unexpected breaks, they have backups ready!
While on the other hand, independent business like Convenience Stores and Franchise businesses like Subway, McDonalds etc do not have this ability. Owners have to deal with unplanned employee scheduling situation on a regular basis. "Ad-Hoc shift" is an answer to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does is very interesting: "Ad Hoc Shift" is a centralized way to provide access to a pool of verified employees who are working in the same field to these small business owners.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of allowing just anybody to sign up, it requires Managers to list their employees in return for accessing our pool.
Given another manager's list of employees and these employees' schedules, "Ad-Hoc Shift" can provide a manager in an exigent situation with a list of verified employees near his location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This works as a win-win situation because minimum wage employers get chance to be paid more during unplanned work while managers can now trust the new person who is going to represent their business.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used vanilla javascript for business, bing API for geolocation and firebase for backend
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing dozens of forms/business logic needed to just set up the basic version for this web app. Setting up a well-thought backend database on the firebase.

                <p>
                    Finished core functionality. Successfully used Bing API for geo-tagging and firebase database

                <p>
                    The overall process to set-up a full web app

                    What's next for Ad Hock Shift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More UI design, features, and functionality.
The big idea is to make it robust enough to sell it.
