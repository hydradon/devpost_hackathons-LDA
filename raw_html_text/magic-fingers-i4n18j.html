                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a new tool to help bridge the gap between people who know ASL and people who don't by creating an interpreter using wrnchAI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is able to take in the data for the hand from a json file provided by the wrnch cloud API and will guess the letter that a person is signing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made our own data sets by taking screenshots from YouTube video tutorials and using the wrnch cloud API. From there, we extracted the data for the hands and trained a keras NN to identify the letter signed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to make a real-time communication tool by using the edge sdk from wrnch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to understand the wrnch API and teach the program to recognize ASL alphabet letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the wrnch API as well as how to train and use the keras NN
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Magic-Fingers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to work on the real-time interpretation using the edge SDK from wrnch. 
We'd like for our program to be able to recognize and distinguish between actual words in the future.
