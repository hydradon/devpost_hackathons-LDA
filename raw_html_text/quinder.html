                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When one comes across a Tinder profile, what one is presented with is not necessarily what one is looking for. People can pretend to be whoever they want to be, and ultimately develop an online persona that does not reflect who they truly are. This idea is reinforced by the fact that 54% of online daters have felt that someone else seriously misrepresented themselves in their profile. Thus, a platform in which genuine relationships can be achieved is necessitated.
