                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we attended the workshop and became extremely interested in what cryptocurrency had to offer. We knew about bitcoin, but we didn't know how it worked. After learning here and there, most of the inspiration that we had developed at the hackathon, sparking a journey for our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the arkjs library in order to implement the basic features and capabilities of ark cryptocurrency, along with its digital wallet, address, etc. Mostly, we went through the process of looking at documentation, and really applying it to ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the documentation, and using the repositories available on github, we used our local ubuntu terminal to download the packages and begin scripting the basic outlines for our keys, passphrases, and address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of the documentation was hard to understand for the basic programmer in jquery or even javascript. We had multiple instances where we had to spend a long time finding the correct packages that worked, as well as properly im following the documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad that though ark.io was known to be hard, we persevered nonetheless. At the end of the day, we found certain errors in the documentation that delay our progress, but once fixed, made the documentation better. At the end of the day, while we may not have contributed a great new application for ark.io, we helped make learning how to use the API easier for people like us (beginners).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found out how to navigate and use Nano on bash. With a background in basic programming, this was a huge leap for us, learning file_name.js files as well as using github, terminal, etc. was a new experience that furthered our knowledge of programming in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ark Interface
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the next steps of what the documentation said, and correcting that would be our next step should we have time. But for the more seasoned programmers, it seems like the vision on how to support the currency and "fairness" amongst users as Ark appreciates in value poses a problem. We hope to be able to see what might the system become in the future, as well as see Ark become as big a name as Bitcoin, and is easy to use with a high sense of security.
