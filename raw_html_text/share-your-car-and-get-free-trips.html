                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main reason is "Mexican people is solidary"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Share car journeys just for people who already has a car. 
We need to have less cars in the street. how? most people who has a car use it for go to the office, so taken that premise, i will use the solidary property to invite people to share their cars journey when they go to the office. 
so, if 2 people have a car each one, and one of them share their car journey then we will remove one car of the street. 
what they win? 
the person that first share their car won or a trip to their office (job) or miles (like airports do) to gets other journey to their job or inter-job (somethines we need move to the other branches of the company) with other car share person, all with no cost!
