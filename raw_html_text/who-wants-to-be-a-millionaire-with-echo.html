                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers tend to have a hard time getting students involved in a topic. We wanted to create something with modern technology that could fill in the blank!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, a user can log in using their amazon account tied to their Echo device to an online platform. Then, fill out an easy online questions and answers form. It will then shoot the questions to the Echo and with a simple voice invocation, Alexa will play Who Want's to be a Millionaire with a chosen player!
