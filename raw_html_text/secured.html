                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2017, when I had my final exams in India, the national topper in Political Science turned out phoney. In an interview, she said the subject was about cooking. $100-200 were paid to replace her answer sheets. Such incidents happen every year.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Examinations and degrees have traditionally been issued on physical papers. The problem with that is now we have a multibillion dollar market for fake degrees. Marks get manipulated and exam papers get leaked. This solution will curb all of those problems and provide transparency.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Vuejs to build the web app. I used the web3 library to interact with MetaMask and the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, I store data in Firebase cloudstore.

                            my laptop died the first night at hackthenorth. I spent the entire night trying to fix it back in my dorm and then eventually ended up joining HTN again on saturday after borrowing a friend's laptop.

                            Vuejs bindings with web3 are really annoying to work with

                        I aim to make a company out of this project eventually by building a platform around this and providing an API for institutions to sign up and issue their own degrees.
