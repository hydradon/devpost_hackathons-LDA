                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walked into the room of the idea groups and were surprised how chaotic everything was. Everybody was motivated too work and find the right team but had no overview of all the different ideas. Therefore, we got inspired by #chaos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it easier to find the team that searches for you and also the other way around. Thus, a more fun experiment on a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Flask for back end for all the team finding process. React for the front end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The typical development struggles. Suicidal thoughts came too. hehe. Moreover, we had the problem of deploying the server because the laptop had the wrong environment for our developer. Also, we had a lot, A LOT of problems in coding with react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not hit our teammates even once! (we love each other so it is fine if we would have fought) Friendship.
Love.
Family.
One member learned a little bit of python. :D
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learn to Code on Javascript and react. A lot of swear words. Prepare for next time a Linux Laptop( you need the right environment).
