                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students, especially young girls, do not often have the money, background knowledge, or resources, or initial confidence to know what kind of hardware they should purchase to learn basic tech skills like circuit development and electronics principles. This is often a barrier to pursuing careers like computer and electrical engineering from a young age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To overcome this challenge, we built a low-fidelity version of Kinnekt- a gamified lesson in electronics principles that allows players to learn hardware skills without stepping out of the virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kinnekt teaches students basic concepts in electronics. It then provides players with a challenge mini-project, where they have to draw in the missing components of the circuit to make the project functional virtually. The game uses an Azure based image recognition model that compares the user's answers with the correct solution set and decides whether they have the necessary components to complete the circuit and move on to the next concept.
