                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was both personal experience and the presentation from Ample Labs during the opening ceremony. Last summer, Ryan was preparing to run a summer computer camp and taking registrations and payment on a website. A mother reached out to ask if we had any discounts available for low-income families. We have offered some in the past, but don't advertise for fear of misuse of the discounts by average or high-income families. We also wanted a way to verify this person's income. If we had WeProsper, verification would have been easy. In addition to the issues associated with income verification, it is likely that there are many programs out there (like the computer camps discounts) that low-income families aren't aware of. Ample Labs' presentation inspired us with the power of connecting people with services they should be able to access but aren't aware of. WeProsper would help low-income families be aware of the services available to them at a discount (transit passes, for another example) and verify their income easily in one place so they can access the services that they need without bundles of income verification paperwork. As such, WeProsper gives low-income families a chance to prosper and improve financial stability. By doing this, WeProsper would increase social mobility in our communities long-term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeProsper provides a login system which allows users to verify their income by uploading a PDF of their notice of assessment or income proof documents from the CRA and visit service providers posted on the service with a unique code the service provider can verify with us to purchase the service. Unfortunately, not all of this functionality is implemented just yet. The login system works with Auth0, but the app mainly runs with dummy data otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Auth0, react, and UiPath to read the PDF doing our on-site demo. UiPath would need to be replaced in the future with a file upload on the site. The site is made with standard web technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was working with technologies that are new to us, so a lot of the hackathon was spent learning these technologies. These technologies include UiPath and React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe WeProsper has a great value proposition for both organizations and low-income families and isn't easy replicated with other solutions. We excited about the ability to share a proof-of-concept that could have massive social impact. Personally, we are also excited that every team member improved skills (technical and non-technical) that will be useful to them in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team learned a lot about React, and even just HTML/CSS. The team also learned a lot about how to share knowledge between team members with different backgrounds and experiences in order to develop the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeProsper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeProsper would like to use AI to detect anomalies in the future when verifying income.
