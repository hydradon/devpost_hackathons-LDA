                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the tech to develop something with a suite of sensors all on our arms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a nerf blaster integrated into a gauntlet that reads your gestures to control it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the 3D printed and laser cut parts were designed today, so this is a fully custom Nerf blaster. We used Arduino for the controls systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to use a Particle board, another brand of microcontroller, that is more IOT and wifi integrated, but it wouldn't communicate with the university wifi. This would have allowed us to integrate Alexa controls as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The laser cutter had a Windows update, and stopped working before we were done using it for the night, so we had to redesign parts for 3D printing instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried other voice recognition software, but it was very difficult, and not very good either.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an iron man gauntlet now, which is pretty cool
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easy tutorials on the internet aren't always easy.
