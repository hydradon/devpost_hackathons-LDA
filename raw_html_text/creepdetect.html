                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes (most of the times), girls receive really creepy messages from guys on the dating app, Tinder. We wanted to troll some of them back
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm consists of a machine learning way to detect if messages received from matches pass a threshold of creep level or not. This machine learning method was built on a database of bad pick-up lines. if the message passes a  creep threshold, it send a Drake lyric back to the match
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Tinder package from Github and modified it to only send messages back to matches who sent messages to me. We built the machine learning method using sci kit learn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating with the Tinder API to only run the algorithm when a match sends me a message first
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to interact successfully with the API and extract the matches sent to me
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    develooped python skills and played around mobile and web apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Creepdetect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    maybe personalize the response sent back to creepy messages instead of an arbitrary message
                </p>
