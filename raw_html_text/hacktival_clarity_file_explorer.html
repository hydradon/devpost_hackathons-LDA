                    The Problem:
I have a lot of files on my pc, some for the university some for private education, a lot of code.
And Pictures. And Music.
When i search something I'm never sure in witch main folder the files resist, is the code in the #university directory, or is it in the #code directory where i store most my code?
This is where the standard Folder structure has its limits.
Wouldend it be nice to find the code from university under #university and under #code?
                </p>

                    Managing files on your Laptop or table often creates a mess and haslimitations given by the folder-structure. Our Application combines the powerof a database-access with the convenience and intuition of a tag-search.

                    What it does:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        assign tags to files and directories on your pc with one click
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        file exploration without drawbacks of folder structure
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
