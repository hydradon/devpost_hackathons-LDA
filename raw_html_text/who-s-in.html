                    As college students, we see the everyday need to network more. We wanted to give back to our community and allow friends and acquaintances to meet up with each other in a stress-free environment to improve their network skills and overall view toward new experiences.

                <p>
                    Our application is called &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s In?&rdquo;. It is a mobile application that allows people to prompt each other with the question, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s in&rdquo;? Who&rsquo;s in to get a bite to eat, who&rsquo;s in to go to the library, who&rsquo;s in to go out, etc. Those who have an account can create groups that they regularly invite to go out with or the user can make their invites more exclusive to less people. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s In?&rdquo; is supposed to be an on the go, quick and direct way for meeting up with friends around you. In a day and age that is always on the go there is always a need for more ways to communicate with each other.

                <p>
                    Our programming team is very proud of the start-up application we created. We all have different levels of programming experience and have all put ourselves in a situation over the weekend to learn more out web development and ourselves. For all of us it was our first time designing an entire mobile application and for one of us his first-time programming completely.

                    Our front end consisted of Ionic for our framework. We also used, Typescript, Angular 2, HTML, and CSS. On the back end, we used Express, Mongo DB, Docker, and Typescript. For all of us this was our first time using Ionic.

                    What&rsquo;s Next
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the short amount of time we could not implement all the features we had in mind so the next step will be to continue with our collaboration on this project. Our goal soon is to implement a chat bot to make asking who&rsquo;s in more fluent, having text-to-speech and talk-to-text recognition for a better user experience, and to fine tune the quality and fluency of the user interface.
