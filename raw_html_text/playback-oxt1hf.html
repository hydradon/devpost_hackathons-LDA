                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a Kickstarter idea that did not do too well in production, so we decide to solve the problem ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an audio clip, saves it to a WAV file and takes the most recent audio and can be played back to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use a particle photon to trigger and communicate with the smartphone. We used Android studio to make an app that can turn on the recording device and stop it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with using the Particle software since we have never used it before. Initially, we had some problems with uploading certain libraries to the IDE. Near the end, we had a problem with manipulating the WAV file so that it only saves the most recent audio that is recorded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attempting to learn the Particle software, we also are proud of being able to take an android app to and communicate with a smartphone to record audio and save the audio file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to splice audio, save audio on the WAV file, combine audio files, we used Java's low-level audio recorder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Playback
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it a compact design so that it is a wearable device on your wrist. Furthermore, making it marketable and available for sale.
