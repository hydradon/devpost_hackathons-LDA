                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was always inspired by going to space and visiting other planets. Since the Viond hashtag and theme for the Hackathon was #VRBucketList I said to myself &bdquo;Why not?&ldquo; and came up with a storyline. In this experience aliens are taking you into space, you will have to solve problems in the spaceship and on different planets. If you succeed, they will take you back to earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the experience you will enter a UFO that will take you to space. Since you (as the immersive character) want the aliens to bring you back to earth, you will have to help them solve some problems. For example, find hidden aliens, answer different questions and visit different planets from the solar system. Finally you have to escape the UFO through a labyrinth. All this will be maneuvered just by &bdquo;looking&ldquo;. So in a nutshell: You have to succeed in different mini-games to get back to earth safely.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Viond builder and tried to come up with solutions to create quick games and have some real interactivity. I used all different kinds of interactive elements like audio, video, buttons, etc. to make the experience as immersive as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was not easy to create all the mini-games because of the restricted possibilities of the Viond builder. I think there are a lot of possibilities - some more inspiration and ideas on &bdquo;what is possible&ldquo; would have been nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amount of interactivity offered would be perfect for little games or learning games (gamification). I definitely will create another application dedicated to that.
