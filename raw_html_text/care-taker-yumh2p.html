                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about making something that would influence the community, and we were looking to focus on health particularly. Imagine a patient with a forgetful memory; they might have to take some specific pills. This project Makes sure that they do that and that the doctor knows and tells them to take it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way it works is effortless, time for a pill?  A doctor presses on a button informing the patient by the led on the bottle, the led flashes several colors. Once the patient takes it, it sends a pop up back to the doctor with the count of the times the patient has taken a pill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put a touch sensor inside the prescription bottle and once the patient touches that, the dragon-board 410c keeps tracks of that and sends it to our server made by node.js. If the doctor wants the patient to take a pill, he presses the button through the web app developed in Angular 2. The action will be sent to the server, which sends it to the dragonboard which in turn makes the led screen flash several lights. Also having the touch sensor, we can know if the patient responded to that led or not, again sending it back to the server and to the web app making sure the doctor gets informed with how many times the patient took the pill. This not only works from a computer but even a mobile web browser and they keep in sync.  The touch signal is sent to all the clients (doctors' PCs), and it shows the count of pills taken as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly, There is not enough material on actually using the groove led with the dragonboard, just making all the hardware work together was a bit problematic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to the hackathon, looking for something to do, we came out with more practical training and knowledge about embedded system and servers. Not to forget the implantation of this project in the actual medical field. I would say that is a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, this being a hackathon, means we can't always do all that we want to do. We want to make users and clients in our server and web apps so that this can be used across different users. Another thing is actually letting the patient know the number of pills he has to take through the led.We would also like to integrate it with more sensors to make it more accurate and use a better smaller micro board.
