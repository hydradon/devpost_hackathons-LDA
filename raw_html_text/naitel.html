                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Citi Bank Gig Economy challenge as it directly affects us since we are joining the economy soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps freelancers to manage their multiple sources of income, as well as calculate the amount of freelance work they will need to do to make a certain amount of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of Citi Bank's API's and some other node.js, express.js, regular js, and other stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    async.waterfall does not like me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to fully understand how the APIs worked, as well as modify them to suit my needs. This was also our first hackathon and my teammate flew from Seattle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to better integrate APIs into my code, as well as node.js and express.js. We also learned to interview 20 acutal customers.
                </p>
