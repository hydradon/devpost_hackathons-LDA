                <p>
                    We've always had difficulty in finding a visual way to book flights! (Sometimes it's nice just to browse, instead of picking two airports you've already chosen) Therefore we wanted to not only make a fun timewaster, but also a way for people to find flights just through clicking!
                </p>
