                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has a public restroom experience they that they wish they could forget. Flushr is here to not only let you avoid those experiences, but also to create a fun social experience of finding and cataloging the most private, clean and all around best restrooms around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a crowd sourced restroom rating app, built on the web, which aggregates data such as overall rating, number of stalls, and building. Currently Flushr tracks restroom data at 89 buildings around Cornell's campus, allowing users to both add their own reviews and view past data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Flushr using web development tools such as Sublme, NotePad++, and Komodo and languages Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had very much experience with Javascript, so having to learn all of its various "quirks" throughout our project was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four relatively unexpeienced undergrads, we were able to build a website that is (in our opinion) pretty well formed. We each contributed an integral part of the project, and it wouldn't have been the same without all four of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That teamwork really does make the dreamwork, and that 36 hours is a really really long time. Also, Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flushr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop a native mobile client for Flushr that lets users report their experiences on the go. In addition, we hope to expand the service outside of Cornell's campus, as we believe that everybody should have access to data on the best restroom to use.
