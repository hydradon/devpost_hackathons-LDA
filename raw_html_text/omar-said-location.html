                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and really work on something that is applicable in the real world.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app monitors your speed and a certain algorithem will look at how your speed changes over time, if there is a sudden stop (and no movement for 5 minutes) it will send a text to a friend telling them to check up on you and provide you their location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it using Xcode and Swift with Node.js as the communicator between the app and the server.

                    Challenges I ran into
