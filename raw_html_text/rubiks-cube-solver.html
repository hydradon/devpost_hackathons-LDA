                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like solving Rubik's Cubes and I wanted to see if I could make a program that could solve one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the steps and turns you need to make on a Rubik's Cube in order to solve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made algorithms that would check what had to be done to solve the cube, preform the moves to keep track of what's  happening to the cube, and after it's solved, it would output all the moves made in order to solve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some parts of solving the cube are fairly intuitive, so it was difficult to translate some steps into code.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to make a program that successfully solves a Rubik's cube.

                <p>
                    I hope to make it into a mobile app or a web app so a user can enter in values for their scrambled cube.
