                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was driving to the Hackathon and while I was driving, I was trying to think of an idea. As I was getting closer to the Hackathon location, I saw a person whose car had broken down. He was trying to get the attention of other drivers, I'm guessing either to take him home or to the nearest mechanic shop. So that is when I thought of the idea, and I brought it up with my team on Friday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app we have built helps individuals around the world to seek for help when their car breaks down. Sometimes the car breaks down on highways and nobody is willing to stop and help, therefore the app will help the person to provide information of the car and seek for help from the nearest mechanic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we have started our code in Java Eclipse. Afterwards, we have converted the java code to android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we had to overcome was to send the information from the app to the "mechanic" email.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to built an app for android within one hour and have our app working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to gather our ideas together and built this app with few obstacles that came along our way. For instance, the Wi-Fi was not working and we had to connect our laptops to hotspots to continue working as well as time management.
                </p>

                    What's next for CarQuickFix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the Hackathon the team has decided to meet up frequently at campus so we can develop this idea more. We hope to launch this product by next year.
