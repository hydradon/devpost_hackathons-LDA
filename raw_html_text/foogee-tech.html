                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve all seen moving scenes on TV of migrants trying to reach a better life in Europe, but how many of us have actually tried to help?
Foogee.Tech by Kingdon is a platform that helps refugees report issues, save important documents and verify identity, while rallying help from local people and businesses through gamification, using just Facebook Messenger without any app install.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It represents a three-party (refugees - local business - local people) self funding platform where a win-win situation is created for everyone. Refugees get help, local merchants get more business and people are happy to contribute to a good cause.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discovering a service while they shop, people can check the issues by opening a map of their surroundings and when they are near a location, help to bring down a fence by playing a game of Breakout and creating awareness.
As numbers of players grow, hopefully walls will come down in people&rsquo;s hearts as well.
