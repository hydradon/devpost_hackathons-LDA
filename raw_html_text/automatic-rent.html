                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create Housemate after being exposed to the life of living with other people in an apartment or house. Organizing bills, calculating how much everyone ones, and getting everyone to pay their shares is a hassle that I intend to solve with HouseMate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Housemate allows the user to create a payment plan in which he can add his roommates to the plan. In the plan, the user can organize who pays what, and how much they owe, as well as the period in which they will be charged. Best of all, HouseMate allows users to automatically pay what they owe, instead of constantly being asked to pay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build HouseMate using Android with Stripe, a payment API, and Firebase, a data storage API, as back ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge I ran into was using Stripe to automatically charge users as, due to its encrypted nature, I would have to run the script over a secured HTTPS connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the UI and UX of the application as well as its implementation of Stripe and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned and became very familiar with Firebase storage and have even implemented into other applications I've created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Housemate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I hope to interview several students who are living off campus or in apartments to get a better idea as to what the core problem is, and to build my app around that.
