                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self Driving Car! We are fascinated by self driving cars and wanted to build a simple one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects object using a ultra-sonic sensor and moves itself to avoid them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time at the invention studio to understand and learn how to use their tools. We built a car model out of wood at the Wood Studio (creating some pretty sweet custom tires).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have the bridge microcontroller pins that would allow us to move our motors in different directions. So we had to find another bridge pin and install that onto our car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a car! It moves and detects objects. We also 3D printed and wood crafted some cool hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no idea how to use the tools at the invention studio. We learnt a lot about 3D printing, wood crafting, laser cutting, arduino wiring, and sending data from/to raspberry pi via bluetooth!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Obstacle Avoidance Tesla
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build on top of this. Putting a camera on it and using machine learning to identity people and other objects will allow the car to be smarter.
