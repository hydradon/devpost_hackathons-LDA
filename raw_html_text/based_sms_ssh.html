                    I'm just going to copy my readme cause it has all of this info.

                    Side Note: This was my first hackathon, and besides having python experience I had 0 experience, or had even heard of the library's, hardware, and API's used. It was one hell of a crash course / learning experience

|  This is a proof of concept python script using the Twilio API to enable control of hardware or software devices via      |
|  SMS messages.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  The goal of this was to control hardware easily through SMS which was done by triggering scripts written                      |
|  in the arduino IDE on an Intel Edison. In the future I would like to flesh this project out and start moving towards            |
|  home automation. I also plan on moving away from SSH and towards scripts fetching SMS commands via databases.   |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  SSH was only used as a proof of concept, it is a horrible idea to use it in this manner due to security. It was only           |
|  used because of the lack of time and the amount of time spent on Edison debugging.                                                         |

|  A python script sets up a flask server which constantly listens for incoming commands. The Twilio API and services    |
|  send these commands via POST when a text is relieved or sent, the incoming post is sent from the flask server            |
|  and processed through this python script which sends back POST to the api, along with commands to the intel Edison,|
|  or whatever device you are connecting to.                                                                                                                                   |

|  Side note: I also used the program ngrok for easy tunneling for the flask server.                                                                   |

                    UPDATE: NGROK has stopped forwarding my post from the API through the ngrok tunnel unabling me to use this w/o    port  forwarding or buying a domain. I will attatch the API logs to show that it does work and I will also 
    include screenshots of the SMS on my phone. Not really sure how to show commands being executed on the Edison
    but I can show the files created and ran and my test scripts if need be.

                <p>
                    Also the edison is a nightmare. Built in bug after bug in the default distro dealing with hardware on the breakout board. I can't even SSH into it anymore even after factory reset, and the error logs are  a mystery. There is very little documentation on this device.
