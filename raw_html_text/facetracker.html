                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to create an alarm clock that could aim at the
                    <del>
                        victim's
                    </del>
                    sleeping person's face and shoot water instead of playing a sound to wake-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, nobody carries around peristaltic pumps at hackathons so the water squirting part had to be removed, but the idea of getting a plateform that could aim at a person't face remained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply tries to always keep a webcam pointed directly at the largest face in it's field of view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The brain is a Raspberry Pi model 3 with a webcam attachment that streams raw pictures to Microsoft Cognitive Services. The cloud API then identifies the faces (if any) in the picture and gives a coordinate in pixel of the position of the face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These coordinates are then converted to an offset (in pixel) from the current position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This offset (in X and Y but only X is used) is then transmitted to the Arduino that's in control of the stepper motor. This is done by encoding the data as a JSON string, sending it over the serial connection between the Pi and the Arduino and parsing the string on the Arduino. A translation is done to get an actual number of steps. The translation isn't necessarily precise, as the algorithm will naturally converge towards the center of the face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the enclosure was a lot harder than what I believed initially. It was impossible to build it with two axis of freedom. A compromise was reached by having only the assembly rotate on the X axis (it can pan but not tilt.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acrylic panels were used. This was sub-optimal as we had no proper equipment to drill into acrylic to secure screws correctly. Furthermore, the shape of the stepper-motors made it very hard to secure anything to their rotating axis. This is the reason the tilt feature had to be abandoned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper tooling
                    <em>
                        and expertise
                    </em>
                    could have fixed these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stepping out of my confort zone by making a project that depends on areas of expertise I am not familiar with (physical fabrication).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easier to write software than to build
                    <em>
                        real
                    </em>
                    stuff.  There is no "fast iterations" in hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also my first time using epoxy resin as well as laser cuted acrylic. These two materials are interesting to work with and are a good alternative to using thin wood as I was used to before. It's incredibly faster to glue than wood and the laser cutting of the acrylic allows for a precision that's hard to match with wood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a lot easier than what I imagined working with the electronics, as driver and library support was already existing and the pieces of equipment as well as the libraries where well documented.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Re-do the enclosure with appropriate materials and proper engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switch to OpenCV for image recognition as using a cloud service incurs too much latency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refine the algorithm to take advantage of the reduced latency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add tilt capabilities to the project.
