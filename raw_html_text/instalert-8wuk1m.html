                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about all the damages that natural disasters do across the country and came up with an easy way to help these people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people to easily contact help or notify loved ones when they are safe, and can quickly get the users location and send it to 911 without wasting time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift to create the app and used a library to take the user's location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very straightforward to find the latitude and longitude of the user, but converting it to a street address was difficult. We also needed to push the message through iMessages or Mail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make an easy to use app that may end up helping many people in the future.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many different functionalities of swift and hope to use this in future hackathon apps
