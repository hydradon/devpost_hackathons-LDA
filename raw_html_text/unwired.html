                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We identified that wired devices such as headphones or keyboards can be quite restricting. So we wanted to establish a wireless link for your comfort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple, affordable plug and play device which replaces annoying cables with a hassle-free wireless link. The functions it supports include allowing your headphones or other USB peripherals such as keyboard or mouse to become conveniently wireless. Apart from personal convenience, commercial applications of this device are extremely wide, ranging from guided museum visits and city tours to targeted audio advertisements inside shops and malls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a low-powered microcontroller connected to a bluetooth module, to behave as a bluetooth transceiver. Its job is to forward incoming data from the wireless bluetooth link to the wired link, such as your earphones.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analog Audio signal filtering and processing is very difficult without proper equipment like oscilloscopes and components like appropriately sized resistors, transistors, and capacitors.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solving the problem with the iPhone 7's lack of audio Jack, with a very cheap and elegant solution.

                    What's next for Unwired
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scaling-down our prototype, designing the case, improving audio signal quality, adding support for HID devices.
