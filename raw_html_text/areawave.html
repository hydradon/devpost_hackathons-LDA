                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, we heard of a girl who was killed in a hit-and-run accident, however, despite wondering what happened we were not able to find out what happened because the corporate news networks did not bring enough attention to this story. We strive to solve this problem using our website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project crowd-sources articles to maintain neutrality for community source news. While many media sources hold biases in their reporting, Areawave goes against the harmful trend of false news. Some significant stories are unheard of typically, but Areawave allows users to view these types of stories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build this by first creating a website with the use of HTML and CSS. At the same time, we also created a database to hold some of the articles and retrieve them in the website. Python was used to retrieve significant data from the databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges making tags for topics that the user is interested in, as we had to get info from a json through python to the html
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our app as a whole, especially how we were able to integrate python into a well-built website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group learned how to construct and manage databases, while also seamlessly integrating them into our website. We also learned some advanced formatting with HTML and CSS in creating a sleek UI, such as scroll layout adjustions, height/width dimensions, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Areawave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to turn Areawave into a completed startup - right now, it is missing a few important features, but once we add those, Areawave could be the next big thing in information consumption.
