                    Wow. Where do we begin. This is our first hackathon with no knowledge or any sort of guidance going into here aside from recommendations and getting ready to code. After the initial exposure we were excited to being working on our exciting project ideas. Unfortunately, we had to deal with figuring out what programs to download, wait an extraordinary amount of time for the programs to download, and try to learn how to do the programs. we wanted to have a game in Unity/unreal engine as a zombie chasing a survivor, but that won't be completed in time allotted. Then we tried to do DDR, but the time it took to learn how to deal with SDL on our visual studio was quite burdensome, and now this our final masterpiece. Our music worked until we moved the files into our GitHub repository (instead of copying it), which created a new directory file, and now it doesn't work.
