                    We were inspired by games such as &ldquo;Reigns&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papers, Please&rdquo;, because we fell in love with the minimalistic, yet surprisingly complex gameplay. We were also greatly inspired by news stories of oil companies and their devastating impact on the environment. Thus, we decided to create a game where the player controls the game starts off with the user fulfilling the role of a financial manager, following with a role of Head of finance, COO, and CEO, with the promotions being based off of making decisions. However, as the game progresses, the player is forced to approve decisions that would increase profit to the detriment of the environment, resulting in a final ending where the (by this point, extremely rich) player gazes out at a desolate and polluted world. The main challenge that we faced was a lack of experience as participating in a hackathon is new to all of our team members. Also regarding to the lack of experience with apps such as Utility and a new style of art, pixel art. Since we did not have much experience, we took longer than we needed to for a lot of the steps involved. Time management was also a major challenge we faced as we did not plan out the time we needed properly.
