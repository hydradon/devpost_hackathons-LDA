                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have a limited budget and access to products. Reutilizing resources among your peers is a better option, especially if you are not using it for the time being. You can save your time and money while bringing a positive contribution to the community. It helps Illinois Tech students at the same time to meet and engage with each other; while being eco-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are building a platform for a peer-to-peer exchange of goods. In our web app, students have the options: 
-borrow: students can request to borrow items that they need by searching it in our database on the web app 
-lend: if a student has an item that they can give out to others, students can simply put it for 'lend'
-donate: students can also donate their products to other students/charity organizations on campus like Circle K, in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pumped by caffeine, we started with the web app: 
We made the skeleton of it (front-end programming), we used angular for a seamless transition between pages and a combination of node.js and firebase (back-end programming).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Backend logistics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Serve Config: 
-Digital Ocean as a service provider.
-Asynchronous NodeJS web server for REST API calls.
-MongoDB as dataStore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server handles different requests from an Android app as well as the Web App. A photo can be uploaded from the android device to the FireBase Storage system, which is later used as a picture for the post. The nodejs server also handles socket.io requests. The android application communicates with the server via sockets to provide real-time updates and handle requests instantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the phone app: 
We use the android studio to build an app for uploading pictures to the server. 
We thought it will be easier to take pictures from a phone rather than from a webcam on the laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement the Walmart-API but we found out that it has a limited database since we can have access to products that are only sold at Walmart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time using firebase for a project. The workshop on firebase inspired us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We strengthen our skills in web programming and one of our members tried Android programming for the first time and learn certain skills on that overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vivre
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can further implement features like an automatically generated description of the product when we take a picture of it (machine learning). 
By scaling up a product, companies can also choose to give away testing products to widen their base and reduce errors. 
To encourage sharing, we are going to implement a rating system that will be aligned with the give-and-take policy. Basically, user will have to be willing to share at least 4 items to be eligible for borrowing 
We can also introduce a fully designed app version for this product.
