                    Inspiration: We are all newly christened adults who want to be politically aware and also reduce any constraints placed on the democratic process while also keeping us in the know about what the people we elect are doing.
                </h2>

                    What it does: The app gives voters updates on what their elected officials are doing,

                    How we built it: We built it as an IOS app using XCode.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Chief among our problems were a lot of knowledge barriers for this project, we knew next to nothing about SwiftUI and even less about the Swift code behind everything.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We were able to create our first app ever, in a language that we literally had less than 6 months experience in combined, within the 24-hour time frame during this hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned about UI design, swift, and how to effectively plan out for a build using design thinking strategies.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeVote: There are a lot of next things for WeVote, and we're ready to share our ideas with you when we demo!
