                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Morse Coding was developed to provide a voice to students with severe verbal and muscular disabilities.
We wanted to expand the domain of communication to those who had previously lost the ability of speaking and for those with loss of major motor function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Morse Coding Program was designed as an alternative way for individuals to communicate. It provides a line of communication that only requires moving two fingers. This program utilizes Morse Code&rsquo;s binary set of inputs so the amount of physical movement is minimized while completely bypassing verbal use. This allows the individual to speak with only the click of a mouse!

                    With the PyQt GUI framework and backend python

                <p>
                    Always hope for updates if there is demand such as implementing a voice synthesizer
