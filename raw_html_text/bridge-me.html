                    90% of start-ups fail to meet consumer expectations despite spending significant expenses on the pre-launch stage of research and building and post-launch marketing campaigns. This is due to a lack of market insight and an understanding of consumer behavior. We bridge this gap by allowing CEOs to test their products on local communities as customers of their desired demographics at the early stages of their start-up development.
