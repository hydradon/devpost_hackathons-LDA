                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration, as freshmen, was the difficult experience of having less opportunity to connect to the diverse group of people available of a college campus. Pear allows students to safely meet new people, and study, eat, and play in the company of students on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pear connects college students based on location, campus, and activity they with to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, blood, and tears. We collectively worked on all components, and received a lot of aid from TAMUHack volunteers. The front-end is exclusively html and css, and the back end is PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running into unfamiliar languages and protocols. This is the first Hackathon for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end and design of the website, as well as the fact that the PHP functions at all!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That PHP is hard, but extremely useful. We learned some database control, as well as a lot more comprehensive web design, overall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook API integration. With this, all users of the site will be verified, and will have to input a lot less information to meet others.
