                <p>
                    The United States has experienced some of the largest disaster power outages in the last month due to natural disaster. Puerto Rico, affected by hurricane Maria on 9/20/2017, remains in a power outage crisis with only about %16 of power restored.

                <p>
                    A disaster relief system that aims to aid areas that lost power due to natural disasters.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A generator is a machine by which mechanical energy is transformed into electrical energy. Generators
can be subdivided into two major categories depending on whether the electric current produced is
alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). The basic principle on which both types of generator
works is the same, although the details of construction of the two may differ somewhat.
A helipad which holds two turbines and flow of power generation installed inside the helipad as show in
the prototype. A helicopter ( with the clockwise rotation of the helicopter blades) . Our idea is to use the
principle of the windmill we are using the backflow of force which opposes thrust created by helicopter
blades to rotate the blades of turbine ( which will be anticlockwise ) in this way it will generate the
electricity and follows the general flow of power generation and we can store that charge in the Nickel
cadmium battery or lead acid batteries. Along with this we have a system which is manually controlled.
We are using the rotor engine rotational axis flow which is manually switched with a liver which
connects the rotor axial rotation to the main blades and to the turbine which is installed inside the
helicopter. Thus we are capable of producing an amount of electricity which can supply electricity to 100
to 200 households. And the turbine arranged outside will be able to produce electricity to 300 to 400
households.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Power distribution, power storage and compatible devices to work with power generated by helicopter blades RPM.
