                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working out is really important for your health. However, it is really difficult for a lot of people to be disciplined enough to go to the gym on a regular basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TeamFitness is a collaborative fitness app where users can team up with their friends to form fitness groups. Users can level up their group by consistently attending the gym according to a set schedule. To do this, a user can record their work out session duration (by pressing the starting and stopping buttons) whenever they are physically close enough to the gym.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native &amp; Firebase (which means that this works on both iOS and Android!)
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native's community is rather small so it's always kind of hard to look things up.
                </p>
