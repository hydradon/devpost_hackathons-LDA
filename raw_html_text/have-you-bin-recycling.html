                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That inspiration that started this project was to enhance the current recycling methods already implemented by using technology to educate, people of all ages, to make a greener future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An educational app to classify waste disposal material using Google Vision API. It locates buyback programs that pay users for recycling and promotes community profiles systems in place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the Proto.io platform and integrated many of the features listed above into the app. For instance, we included various pages such as a home page, a search page, a photo page, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we went into is at first we wanted to expand this globally, but realized that this was too difficult to accomplish. So instead, we decided to focus on a more specific area like Nashville, TN so that we can use better search terms to find more information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we came up with was designing an app using a prototyping platform to illustrate our concept of classifying waste disposal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about teamwork, communication, improving our skills using Proto.io, and learned more about the design process through this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Have you bin recycling?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating code into the program to allow for picture recognition of different products would be the next step for this project.
