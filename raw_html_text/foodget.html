                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our first hackathon, we were very excited about prototyping our idea. We've always wanted to be able to create and explore recipes that provided financial information and the capability of creating budgets for those recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to create recipes, in which the app computes the total calories and nutritional values and price. The user can then view all submitted and add specific ones to a list that creates a grand total.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began the project by designing a general layout that would suit our needs. We later realized, that due to time limitations, we reduced the prototyped idea to a very clean and simple use case that specifically targets budgeting and handling food data. Utilizing Webpack to transpile JSX [ react ] into a single output file / web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We dreamed a little too big at the beginning and ended up realizing we would not have enough time to complete all of our ideas, having to cut multiple features and functionality out of the prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new technologies and grew a lot as developers. We were able to get out our base idea with a working prototype in time for submissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between both of us, we were able to get comfortable using git together during this project. We also normalized our knowledge of React, and other used technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the social aspect of it (i.e. profile, following capabilities, and real-time news feed). We ultimately want to incorporate a Facebook-based login and a "share to Facebook" option. We liked the idea so much that we do plan on continuing its development after the hackathon.
