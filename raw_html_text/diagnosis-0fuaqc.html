                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love anything related to biology and the medical field. Also, since I knew that the amount of money wasted by doctor's appointments is a large sum, I wanted to eliminate the unnecessary trips. Using these 2 points, I tried to make a program that caters to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is a simplified version of what could be used as a whole database for different diseases and medical issues along with their symptoms. My program uses a database of different cells and takes a random image of a white blood cell to try and find the relatively similar looking white blood cell in the list of the thousands of cells. This is done by comparing the difference amount and selecting the images that have the least difference from the original image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python to first code in the file full of pictures of cells. Then,  I chose some images of white blood cells and compared it to these previous pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I kept getting the error that the dimensions were not the same. I eventually changed the dimensions as part of my program to fix this, but it took a lot of trial and error to get it correct.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I learned more python and learned more about the syntax to use for images, since I was quite confused at the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more python and list development as well as how to insert images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Diagnosis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diagnosis can be used to improve the medical world. With this program, millions of people can save money and at the same time know if their issue is serious and needs to be handled. The basics of my program can be developed to help everyone in a better fashion.
