                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like boba, and are too lazy to make the 10 minute drive to the nearest boba shop. So we made a machine to make boba for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A cup starts at the beginning of a conveyor belt, and goes through a gauntlet - first boba mix drops in the cup, then a coffee pot is turned on and adds hot water, then tapioca bubbles are added, and finally a stirrer is released for you to combine your drink.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Python script that pairs with our machine over USB to start the process. We used an Arduino Uno to control all of our motors (conveyor belt, release powder, release bubbles) , and used a Belkin Wemo smart plug and a companion Python API to turn on the coffee pot to boil the water (Python will send serialized signal to app, and then will call Python API. )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not engineering students and design is hard (sad!) Getting the servos to works as we needed them and structuring the circuit to work accurately was a challenge.

                    This is Diane's first hackathon! She learned a lot. Also, we finished this project. It's lit.

                <p>
                    Engineering design is hard!!  Also Python is f**************** amazing.

                    idk we need to return all this hardware (Sad!)
