                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were always unprepared when going outside at Purdue, because it always feels colder or hotter than ## the forecast suggests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes into account wind speed to suggest what type of clothes you should wear
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS and openWeatherAPI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importing the frameworks into xcode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the location of the user and displayed the weather using an api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to get the user's location in ios and use an api
                </p>

                    What's next for BundleUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could upgrade it to give more detailed suggestions and have a better suggestion algorithm
                </p>
