                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was designed because it can be challenging to find roommates after one moves out
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using adobe dreamweaver
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to incorporate VR into it for virtual touring of apartments but was having a hardtime rendering images.  WE have never worked with VR and really wanted to experience it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the whole thing almost from scratch and felt good! Our Website looks really nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the structure of VR code, and the premise that it runs on.  We also looked into virtual environments of touring houses to draw in inspiration for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Roomate Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop it into a more robust website and maybe actually finish it and make it fully functional one day.
