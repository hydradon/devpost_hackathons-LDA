                    We are all lonely creatures who sometimes need a friend to talk to. This bot aims to help relieve some of that loneliness by sounding more human.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was build using Microsoft Azure, HTML, and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge ran into was that the bot was a QnA bot, which means it was limited to only answering questions given to it. My team circumvented this problem by expanding the scope of the questions.
