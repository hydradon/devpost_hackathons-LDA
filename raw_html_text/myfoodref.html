                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind myFoodRef arose when my teammate and I discussed ways where we can keep track of our health. We figured diet is a core aspect of health. As a result, we decided you build an app that allows one to better plan out their diet and to be given a more informed view about nutrition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    myFoodRef keeps track of the food you eat everyday. This can be done whenever you add food to the food list. There is a separate goal's section that allows one to keep track of any dietary goals and see if they have reached them. Last but not least, there is a calendar section that allows one to navigate their food list by date and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Vue project using version 3 of the Vue CLI tool. We also used third party components like BootstrapVue and V-Calendar to our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into minor challenges such as styling and integrating third party components into our application. Since we have little experience with Vue, building an application with it was somewhat of a minor challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting the tab UI to look good and also learning a great deal of Vue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Vue to create a web application that is built with mobile devices in mind.
                </p>

                    What's next for myFoodRef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate more features such as an analyzer for the food items aggregated to the list.
