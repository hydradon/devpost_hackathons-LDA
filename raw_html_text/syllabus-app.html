                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This inspired us to build an app that will organize all of our assignments and also remind us what assignments were coming soon. We wanted to make it as simple as possible. Our first idea was having the user being able to input all of the information but lets be honest, college students are lazy. We thought of the idea of allowing students to take a photo of their syllabus and it will automatically add it to their calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It converts the students picture of the syllabus and automatically imports it into their calendar. It also reminds you what is coming up and what assignments you have completed already.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OCR technology to turn the photo into text. After being able to turn the photo into text, we developed a script to detect dates and parse all of the data into a calendar we made. We used Swift for the IOS app, and we used Laravel framework for the backend technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was turning the image into text. This was the most important part of the application because we wanted to make it very easy for students to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest Accomplishment was being able to complete so many features of the application in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use OCR technology, how to use calendars and relationships on MYSQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Syllabus app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to continuing this project and publishing it into the app store.
