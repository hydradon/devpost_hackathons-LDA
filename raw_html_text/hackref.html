                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medical students already have tonnes of work on their plates: struggling with referencing essays shouldn't be as much of a bother as it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads your essay, figures out the underlying topics and then sends you all the related reference papers it can find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Microsoft Text Analysis tools, and obtained the API for Topic Analysis. I integrated this with the PubMed API, so that the reference papers could be accessed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Microsoft API only works with a minimum of 100 documents sent at a time, so I had to sit with the sponsors to figure out how to get around this as you would usually only send it one document at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use HTML for the first time so that I could work on the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackRef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's far from perfect, so I plan on actually finishing HackRef. I want to be able to use it for my own essays.
