                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to put LEDs on my guitar so that onstage it would add to the experience when I play different tones and notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes live audio in and displays lows, mids, and highs as different colors and mixes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to do the audio processing and an Arduino with RGB LEDs and MOSFETs to display the colors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Latency problems. We had to optimize functions and algorithms to make sure the audio and light were absolutely in sync. Hardware hacks like these come with tons of problems. Let alone a semi-colon, 1 loose wire of many can cause major headaches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speed and accuracy of processing. Some of the speed algorithms we made are really cool to think about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about signal detection and how computers handle input and output efficiently
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ForeYay!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logarithmic audio analysis instead of a linear scale. Machine Learning to adjust frequency ranges and amplitude thresholds.
