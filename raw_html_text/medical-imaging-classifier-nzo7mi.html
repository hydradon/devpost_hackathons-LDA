                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very excited to learn more about ML / CNNs, and we're interested in applying this technology the medical field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user, presumably a doctor, will take an XRay scan in png format and submit it to our console. Our app will return the score likelihood that the XRay contains an abnormality, based on a model trained using various abnormal XRay scans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Jupyter and Keras to build and train the model, then we used NodeJS/Express to build the web portion of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we're new to machine learning, there was a learning curve with setting up and using the models, but after a lot of research we got the hang of it.
