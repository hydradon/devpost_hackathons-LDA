                    . In the U.S., the quality of learning people receive is highly varied, with magnet and private schools often providing much more for students than their public counterparts. Now with access to powerful, immersive Augmented Reality experiences, Linguis is redefining what learning can be. Combining the virtual world with surrounding 3D space, Augmented Reality allows Linguis to provide an experience unlike any other, enabling students to collaborate with one another, study more effectively, and aggregate their classes and schedules. Linguis provides a complete educational experience, with a current focus on language students. Linguis is designed as a platform for any learning experience, with a vision for the future, expanding on technologies that are just coming to fruition.

                <p>
                    Linguis has a multitude of features to enhance educational experiences. Using ARkit, Linguis offers four distinct module framework:
                    <em>
                        card
                    </em>

                    </em>
                    , and
                    <em>
                        writing
                    </em>
                    . With
                    <em>
                        Card
                    </em>
                    , Linguis projects virtual objects that users can interact with. With a current focus on language learning, Linguis integrates these projections in quizzes and study tools so users can describe what each projection is. Under the
                    <em>
                        Grammer
                    </em>
                    module, users can move characters or objects in AR with image recognition, creating correct word spelling or completing puzzles.
                    <em>
                        Scan
                    </em>
                    creates translations of objects around you in AR, enabling users to learn the names of objects around them. And finally, the
                    <em>
                        Writing
                    </em>
                    module allows for users to practice their writing characters efficiently. Each Linguis experience is tailored to the user's age, separating the learning experience of younger and older students. While these modules are focused on language learning currently, these frameworks can be applied to learning any subject - math, science, programming, etc. Linguis additionally has a calendar and notes organization system so users can monitor due-dates and classwork, look at their past recorded notes to study, watch videos from professors on subjects they are stuck in, and chat with friends to complete assignments.

                    The Linguis team used Apple ARkit extensively for the augmented reality experience, coding in swift on XCode. The team used Sketch 3 for developing the UI, created an interactive website, and implemented open-source libraries for machine learning and computer vision applications. Additionally, we used Blender and Solidworks for creating 3D assets for the
