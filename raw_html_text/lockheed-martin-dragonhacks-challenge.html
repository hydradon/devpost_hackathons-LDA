                    In my recent discovery and understanding of what "big data" consists of, I have grown very interested in how much we can learn from it. Since it is a constant intake of data of different measurands (items being measured), this causes one to find patterns and trends in the data that may help towards the project in the future.

                    I am proud of taking on a second task in the 24 hour time limit to teach myself about complex data and how NASA and Lockheed Martin analyze it, for example.
