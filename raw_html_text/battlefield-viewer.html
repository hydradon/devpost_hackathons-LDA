                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The talk on Android Development gave me the inspiration to begin an app, and while looking through the docs I saw the Google ARCore which looked amazing. That inspired me to create something that would let you have a virtual tabletop model in place of the classic war modeling many people do.

                    Uses Augmented Reality to project a battlefield onto your table.

                    Getting military models for free in a format (blender) that I could use with ARcore.
