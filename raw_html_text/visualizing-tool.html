                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Many apps place the responsibility on the sexual harassment and violence victims to protect themselves but we wanted to take a broader and deeper approach by driving community and culture change specifically in college campuses. We wanted to address the issue of of the lack of data that makes it hard for NPO's to advocate for policy change and for law enforcement to identify patterns of unsafe conditions.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How it works
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We took a 4 prong approach to this problem: community-driven, anonymous space to report injustice, real time data, and accountability.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Community-Driven
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Each user is affiliated with their campus because we believe that students are motivated by making their own campus better.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Anonymous
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Users can report an incident to the app as a bystander or victim anonymously through geotagged posts that we use to generate a map visualization for users.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Real-time Data
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As reports populate our map, we provide real time data through a REST API for University administration, non-profits, police, student groups and organizations and users to use to for data analysis, data visualizations or campus sexual assault reports.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Accountability
                </h3>
                <p>
                    By providing our data publicly, we believe that we are holding Universities more accountable for their current efforts on sexual harassment/violence on their campus.
                </p>
