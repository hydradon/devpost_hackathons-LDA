                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help students and parents prevent over packing. This is a feature that could potentially bring more students to UICI due to the uniqueness of the application. This would lead to higher student retention after graduation since there are more students coming to campus, there is a higher probability of students staying.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to view their future dorm room in real space and allow for modification to customize their room to fit their accessories, without packing too much.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity with steamvr and vrtk, with the oculus rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into an issue with setting up the VR with the laptops we have, but we got it working after a period of time. We also ran into issues finding assets for free. Once we had some assets, we had issues with those assets and their collision detection with our controllers and other objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with nothing and we used some assets packages to assist in a rapid development for a minimal viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work better as a team. We also learned a new technology that is somewhat difficult to learn and created a unique application in 24 hrs while most of the team was just learning how to develop in VR
                </p>

                    What's next for College Dorm VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue this by adding customized objects and perfect the user interaction with objects and moving them around in the space.
