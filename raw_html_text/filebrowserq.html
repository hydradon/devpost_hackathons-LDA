                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble finding some downloaded pictures for a powerpoint and wanted an simple alternative to macOS's Finder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to browse through their system and see their photos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use qt and used what I knew about C++ to build this image browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use qt from scratch took a few hours and the the amount of classes and their functions can get overwhelming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the pictures not show up in their original sizes since some of them were too big to fit on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make a GUI for a program and how to link buttons and functions together.
                </p>

                    What's next for FileBrowserQ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing it to access other file types and make it look more professional.
