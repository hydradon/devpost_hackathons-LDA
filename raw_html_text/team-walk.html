                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People feeling uncomfortable while walking home alone at night as it can be quite a daunting experience, especially with the recent muggins of students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to register and access the app their my.monash portal and log in.
                    <br>
                    Users who join will have their info cross-checked against Monash data.
                    <br>
                    Matches users together when walking to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of crime.
                    <br>
                    Users living around campus make posts of their walking trips for others to request to join.
                    <br>
                    Each user has the number of completed trips and their rating by others displayed.
                    <br>
                    Meeting up point is chosen from a selection of pre-existing hubs around campus.
                    <br>
                    Destination, is the split-up point, is the midpoint between the two users (for privacy and security).
                    <br>
                    Can contact security who will be sent GPS coordinates and route for emergencies.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The survey was created in google forms and distributed using Monash Stalkerspace (FB).
                    <br>
                    Personas were created using the data sourced from the survey and the tools provided in moqups.
                    <br>
                    The low-fidelity wireframes of the prototype that were drawn up by pencil by the UI team.
                    <br>
                    The final prototype was built using sketch.
                    <br>
                    The web app was coded using javascript, html/css, jquery, firebase, googlemaps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was insufficient time to get the process of making post done on the prototype. We had to settle for just the request process.
                    <br>
                    There are some challenges with the login process where clicking multiple times may make multiple entries into the database.
                    <br>
                    There is also some trouble working with the database as it's was a very complicated process to update the information and read that into the current host.
                    <br>
                    Implementing the map API was also a difficulty that we had some trouble overcoming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the whole process of requesting to join a trip completed on app prototype, which we belied we would have a hard time doing.
                    <br>
                    We are proud of the front end design.
                    <br>
                    We are proud of the fact that we did actually manage to get the web app up and functioning. There was very limited time available for us to code the project, so we didn't think that the web app would actually be functioning, however, the code that we did write is fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make friends in the app and in real life
                    <br>
                    The web app is actually functional! The amount of time that was available was very low and we did not expect to get it functioning in time, but we strived through it and did manage to make it functioning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeamWalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    TeamWalk would like to create the 'posting' process of using the app for the prototype as well.
                    <br>
                    The web app needs to be coded further until it resembles the ideal finished version that has been made the prototype.
