                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a VR game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a VR game about sorting randomized objects and trying to get the highest score possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built in Unity using Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality framework.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR is a lot harder than it looks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working game (however simple) by the end of the day was pretty satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game development is hard enough, doing it in VR adds a whole extra level of difficulty and complication.
Luckily the framework is pretty friendly, but since the technology is still young, it's very finicky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stressful Sorting Simulator [Table 4]
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of ideas for thematic changes that could make the game funnier or more grounded in a story, but I didn't have time to do so. I'd love to expand on the game and grow it further by adding more obstacles, gamemodes, etc.
