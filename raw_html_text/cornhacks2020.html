                    We wanted to make a game for kids that pushed them to enjoy the outdoors and have fun exploring the wilderness. We learned a lot about time management and problem solving. There were times when we worked together on the same thing and other times where we broke out and worked on separate Git branches. We mainly faced challenges merging as Unity does not like to merge its Scenes easily.
