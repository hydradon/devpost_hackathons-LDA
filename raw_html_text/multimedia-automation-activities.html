                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RPA is a disruptive technology and that fact has become extremely evident specifically in certain industries like banking, telecoms, insurance &amp; of course the technology industry itself. 
But could RPA be used in industries that seem totally unrelated? The challenge was to find the most unlikely industry that could benefit from RPA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For one, The creative Industry seems worlds apart from RPA and it couldn't possibly benefit from automation right? Wrong! On closer inspection it turns out there is just as much repetitve workflow as in other industries and therefore it can benefit from and and as a consequence be disrupted by RPA.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This set of custom activities enables the automation of video, audio and image operations by making use of the FFMPEG command line utility. This utility provides endless possibilities for media processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Visual Studio Community and the UiPath community edition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first custom activity ever, so I had to read up a lot and look at examples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works elegantly and reliably. There is so much potential too going forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create a custom activity for UiPath, yeah!
                </p>

                    What's next for Multimedia Automation Activities
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many features which could be added. I would like to get some feedback and then decide which features will be most useful going forward.
