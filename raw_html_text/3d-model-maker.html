                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a changeable model of a city without starting from scratch, so we looked at Google Earth as a means to achieve the model. We wanted to build a tool that allowed us to export parts and pieces of Earth as a .obj file. We then have the capability to modify that file however we wanted. We ended up created an interactive tour of a part of the city within Google Daydream.

                <p>
                    Pick a place in Google Earth and it will make a 3D model of it for you.

NO Community Support because the new google earth was released ~2 weeks ago.

                    We built a simple VR game using the automated process of building a 3D model from Google Earth as a reference.
