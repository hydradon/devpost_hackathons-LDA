                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever I finish writing an essay, I always have to stop and think "what should I name this thing??"  I had also heard about Watson and thought that this would be a good opportunity to learn about the api while making a useful app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an essay as input and generates some possible titles based on the ideas contained inside of it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized the concept insights service provided by IBM Bluemix in order to analyze the input text and I used python on the backend to generate the titles.
                </p>

                    My own confusion about how webapps run.

                    Learning the javascript necessary to complete the app.
