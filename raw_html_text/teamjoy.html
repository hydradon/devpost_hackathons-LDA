                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I often forget the name of the person I've recently met at an event, or at work. Sometimes I have to look them up on LinkedIn to remember their name. This idea came from the need for people to form a closer relationship with each other when we're attending the same event, or work at the same company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter the event code and sign up via LinkedIn. Once you sign up, you can see people in your org with their LinkedIn profile pictures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend of the app is written in Node.js, front end is React. Deployed on Heroku.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LinkedIn restricted access to API developers so we have to go through vetting process to get someone's public profile link.
                </p>
