                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes, communities that are impacted by natural disasters and economic disparity are unable to gain adequate resources from the government during their times of misfortune. In the United States of America, this has been demonstrated in varying instances such as the Flint Water Crisis and failed recovery relief attempts during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria. These events acted as catalysts for the development of a necessary site to provide resources to disadvantaged and disaster-prone communities, and allows direct access to organizations willing to protect local needs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    W.A.D.R. connects charities directly to communities that need assistance. Likewise, W.A.D.R. provides its users to charities that have signed up to assist the community and have indicated what resources are available during times of need. W.A.D.R. focuses on the availability of resources such as food, water, shelter, and clothing during times of need.
Our database is updated by charities on a regular basis. We use geo-location to find out the nearest resources to match to the user's needs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application using the technologies of MAMP, SequelPro, and Visual Studio. The languages that we used are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only two of our team members came from a coding background, and the others were well versed in Humanities and Arts. One problem in development was hosting the website. We could not get the website to host on Amazon free AWS as it takes 24 hours to be authorized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a web application with an working login system, and database. Our application looks great and our team members learned a lot throughout the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time doing web development all but one of our members. This whole experience of building the front-end and a back-end was a great learning experiences for all us.
                </p>

                    What's next for We All Deserve Resources (W.A.D.R.)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continued development of the application. We will utilize more of the Google Map's API technologies in the future.
