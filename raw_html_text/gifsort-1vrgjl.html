                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea through a late-night brainstorming session, where we chose this app for being kind of cute and the idea that was within our combined programming range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is a game that encourages mindfulness by having you sort random GIF's (pulled through the GIPHY API) into one of four randomly chosen categories. You win by correctly sorting the most GIFs in the least possible amount of time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android Studio and Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One particularly annoying challenge was the fact that the GIF's kept on overstepping the bounds of the space we gave it, so that it was always running into other elements on the activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JSON file parsing was also very annoying-- we just couldn't get the GIPHY API to return the JSON file we were expecting.

                <p>
                    Jane: "I'm proud of how creative it is. And that I came up with it. (I can't believe this idea is legit)"
Hana: "The puns."
Walter: "I learned how to code!"
Maki: "Being actually useful. And the infinitely scrolling background."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we're proud of our idea and the fact that we were able to choose an idea that we were actually able to implement within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of 24 hours, we learned a lot about Android Development: About how ridiculously easy it is to edit various pictures and buttons; About how to hack together an infinitely scrolling background; and how to divide up work on a programming job between four people and use Github to tie it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GIFsort
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we think that the app is really cool in its current state, we think that improvements could be made in terms of UI and the way the GIF's loaded. For example, we had many ideas about how to preload the GIF's so that they would be loaded faster, and while we managed to make GIF loading time manageable, we think it could be made smoother by somehow caching the GIF's ahead of time. We also want to implement various small things that would make the experience smoother and more fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TL;DR
While this method of sorting GIF's may not be as efficient as, say, mergesort, Instead of running in O(N log N) time, we believe that this sorting algorithm runs on O(fuN) time. and as they say, time flies when you're having fun (so it's really more analogous to a O(1) algorithm).
