                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to organise a new years party in sydney, never go out in sydney after the lockout laws that sucks. so I said i'll host it at my house and then got 20$ from everyone and made 200 jelly shots and 120 burritos and 2 cases of beers and tequlia, best nye ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    takes a facebook event and organises people paying the host and what they get for it, think crowd funding party.

                <p>
                    20 hours facebook API ( half the time searching ) 
4 hours db , models, config, routing
4 hours paypal 
2 hours on features and getting things stable

                <p>
                    i can't learn node js in three days, so I did it in c# even though the identity integration.

                    make money and party
                </p>
                <p>
                    no but seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step one re write everything with out the time constraints and get proper permission from facebook and login integration working better.
step two get the party page looking more ux friendly
step three add payment outs (didn't get time) 
step four payments out in bitcoins.
step five add more party options and sliders for choosing things you want based on price 
eg
&lt;(goon)-----------(case of beer)------------(sailor jerries)&gt;
&lt;(fairybread)--------------(migoreng noodles)----------(custom food)&gt;
