                    We were inspired by how some materials are able to reduce the impact of brute and sudden force to minimize damage. The material that we chose called Sorbathane, has those capabilities and more. We 3D printed the wing of a plane and painted the places that the material would be applied to. Our main challenges were finding a cost to go with our presentation and our 3D model snapped in half so we had to reattach it. We're proud of all of the work and findings that we put towards the project and discovering a cool new material to be applied for future purposes. Learning a lot about materials, collaboration, and solving problems, we look forward to applying this to real life experiences. Next up is presentations and wowing the judges!
