                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a long string of hackathon projects devoted to my new programming language, I decided to go back to game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last Man Flying is a first person aerial combat game in which you are the last soldier of a fleet that has all but been wiped out. But instead of dying in vain, you take to the skies for revenge.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last Man Flying is built using my own game engine: Kaeon ACE Ascent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several more things I wanted to implement, but overall I'm satisfied with how it turned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people seemed to like the game.

                    Steam. Maybe.
