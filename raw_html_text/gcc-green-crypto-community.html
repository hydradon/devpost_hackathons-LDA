                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Global warming has become an undeniable problem. As individuals, we can help to create a more environmentally friendly neighborhood, both for ourselves and for others, by planting at home. And as the idea of organic food becomes more and more popular, planting veggies or herbs in our backyard not only creates a sustainable source for organic food but also enables a possibility to sell the extra plants to others in need.

                    <li>
                        the platform was built using ruby-on-rails
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        smart contracts were built with solidity
## Challenges we ran into
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the scope of the project is not well designed and hence we had a problem finishing it
