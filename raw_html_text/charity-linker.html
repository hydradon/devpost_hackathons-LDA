                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right charity to donate can be really hard, and we decided to make this project as a way of making things easier
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has every user build their own preferences of charities they want to donate to, then it makes it easier for the user to find new local charities that they would donate to. It also can scan the items that the user would like to donate and show charities that are accepting of the items
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the backend using express to handle requests and mongodb for the database. We used react-native for the front end of the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was hard to properly connect the front end and the backend since we didn't have much time left after the front end and back end both finished work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an extensive database of the charities and can quickly filter them out based on the user requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with APIs that don't want to work.
