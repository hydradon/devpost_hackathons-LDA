                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group as a whole had very little experience in Unity, and wanted to learn how to make a game together. We brainstormed some game mechanics and came up with RGB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RGB gives the player control over red, green, and blue filters. When they are activated, all objects in the world of that color will disappear, allowing the player and other objects to pass through them and solve puzzles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each colored object is tagged with its respective object. When the player activates a switch, a global function is called that modifies the color of every object in the scene, giving the effect of a RGB filter. Enemies are constructed of two color components, allowing the player to switch the color and attack their inner color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group had minimal experience with Unity, and it took a lot of trial and error, Googling, and testing ideas to get a working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy with the concept and glad that we were able to get a (somewhat) working version of our idea in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us came out of this hackathon with more experience in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RGB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue the project and flesh it out into a full game!
