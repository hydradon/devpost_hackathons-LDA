                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired for this project from my personal experience in finding a place to eat outside. I usually have a lot of options when I want to eat outside, like for lunch or for a date, and sometimes it's a bit overwhelming and hard to choose. I thought of having a virtual assistant that helps me in these times to decide on a place and also helps me to discover new places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Charlie recommends a place to eat outside based on the occasion (whether it's a casual lunch or a business dinner) and based on my previous visits and preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the prototype for the iOS platform using SwiftUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though I'm a seasoned iOS developer, I don't have that much experience with SwiftUI and it's quite different from the usual way of building iOS apps with UIKit. There were a lot of cases where even the most basic stuff took some time to do.
                </p>
