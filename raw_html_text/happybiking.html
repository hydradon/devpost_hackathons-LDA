                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help children enjoy biking while going to school or anywhere else. Thus creating a pleasant experience for the student while riding and also giving an urge to go out to do some physical exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The students can start a app from their android mobile before they start from their source location and then while the student is on the road, the letters of English alphabets gets collected in the app according to the time and location the student is travelling. Once the student has reached the destination location, he can use the collected letters to make as many words as possible and improve their English skills. This creates an interest in the student to ride more and to learn more eventually. And finally when the student submits the answer, the answer are compared with a text file in the student mobile which is a dictionary.txt which contains all the dictionary word in it and gives out the score of the student as well. Hence he can improve further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio app and basically created 3 activities to implement the above mentioned functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the above app we tried to integrate the google maps API to improve it much further but it was a tough job and hence for now we excluded that feature and implemented the rest in our app. For now the words are calculated using the time period the student is riding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we implemented most of what we had in mind about the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to integrate API's into mobile app but couldn't combine that integrated API with our main app. We also learnt a lot more about how the mobile application is function as we coded through the activities in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HappyBiking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; We are planning to implement the google maps API and also to integrate one more feature which will help the parents know the students location if they send a message to the students mobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt; For the parent app part, once the parent sends a message, automatically the google map location link(GPS based, if GPS is not working, the network is accessed) from the kids mobile is sent as a text message to the parents without the student's need to access the mobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt; We plan to add this feature that we have already and add the google API and do further improvements to it. One more thing we can add to the app is that check whether the student is originally riding from the source to the destination or not. And if the student tries to use the mobile while riding or inbetween, we can cancel the game for the student during that ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -&gt; We can also create a student class community to improve the usage and learning experience in classrooms. Biking leaderboard can also be created eventually.
