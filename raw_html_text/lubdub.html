                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration comes from my educational background, through my time in the clinical area. I often had a hard time distinguishing many of the different sounds you could hear on the ward. So I thought to myself if only I have some sort of way to match up these sounds through an app... and here I am today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By running a recorded sound through a custom built stethoscope, it can match a heart sound with other heart sounds on a database to distinguish and recognise what sound is being recorded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app was built on HTML5 and javascript with a couple of audio recording API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the time constraint and the fact that there is no existing API for what we are trying to accomplish as well as the subpar grade equipment used to make the hack. but the biggest factor was the fact that the algorithm used and the fact that it would take at least a week for it to be built up to workable levels
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the fact that I was able to make an electrical stethoscope for under $50
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that just because you don't finish a hack doesn't mean it's a bad idea
                </p>

                    What's next for lubdub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvement of audio recognition 
mobile support
lung and abdomen sounds
sharing of sounds as well as saved sounds
