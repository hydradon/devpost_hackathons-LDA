                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is often difficult for one to find opportunities for volunteering easily, considering that most of these opportunities are spread by word of mouth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Post connects potential volunteers with organizations and individuals who are determined to make a difference.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java for the backend, since that is what most of us knew. We used Jetty for the web server framework and SQLite for a simple test database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first tried using a small web server library called NanoHTTPD, but it turned out to have almost no helpful documentation and was a pain to use. We switched our entire website to Jetty once we realized it would be more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a website with registration and login without having much prior knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that what is simple in concept is often complicated in practice.
                </p>

                    What's next for Project Post
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Post needs a search feature for users to find volunteer projects in their vicinity.
