                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As initially awkward kids, it would have been nice to have a platform
where we could find people that were strangely like us. This platform aims
to solve that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user fills out a questionnaire and is then matched with a person of similar 
personality based on an algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used html/css for front end. We used firebase to handle the database and store our profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were almost able to implement IBM's personality insight API, had it working in the terminal itself
but it was not feasible to finish it with the time we had left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement firebase without having much exposure to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to have various back up options since some features will ultimately be scratched by 
the end of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Link Blue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to completely implement IBM's personality insight.
