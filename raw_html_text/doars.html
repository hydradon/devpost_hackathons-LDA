                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rick and Morty, Dr. Strange, a variety of TV shows and movies all feature portals to another universe. So let's use AR to bring that into real life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phone application that runs Unity to download different "doors" and "rooms". Users can upload on the website, and find their file and experience a portal to that room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used HTML, CSS, Javascript for the website, Unity for the game engine, ARcore for the AR things, Django for the backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major versioning issue with ARCore's camera, where its parent wouldn't follow its child through a filter to proc the spawning of AR objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully finished the essentials of the entire project from front end to back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use ARCore, how to link front end and back end to servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for doARs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting for ARCore to be compatible with stereoscopic lens so it can be ported AR headsets.
