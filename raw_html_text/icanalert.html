                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ICANAZ has a service that ensures the safety of underprivileged families. This resource they provide is extremely useful and their pitch impacted us the most. Additionally, we felt that we could solve their particular problems with our particular set of skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a single place where a user, mainly a parent, can open the app and be alerted when an urgent incident occurs in their area. Additionally they are in the know about after-school programs that ican is hosting so they can be more involved with extra-curricular programs. They can find out about events through ICAN's twitter page which is integrated in the app. This will allow students to be active and stay off the street.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Android Studio which is uses java to code different parts of the app. Also we have an iOS application that does the same functions. The Twitter page in the app is uses a program called Fabric which allows using Twitter's API easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as trying to integrate Twitter without the user of the app having to log into Twitter or have a Twitter account to see ICAN's Twitter page.

                    What's next for ICanAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .ICanAlert can be taken by ICAN so they can communicate with their clients. Additionally, they can hire some developers to improve the functionality of the app.
