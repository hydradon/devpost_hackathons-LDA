                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to leave our campus better than we found it. We decided to do this by bettering the student experience. We can collectively save them hundreds of hours a semester and keep them more organized with better grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a picture or pdf or any other file type and converts it to a bunch of events that can then be moved into your calendar or event manager of choice. We are on google calendar and discord trello and our own website. We use Microsoft CV family of apis.
