                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CollBox was born when one of our team members was running an IT consultancy and learned first hand what it's like to have slow-pay and no-pay customers. He explored debt collection services and found an industry that was inefficient and lacking in trust and transparency. He knew there had to be a better way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over $800B goes unpaid to US businesses every year&mdash;equivalent to 5% of the US GDP!&mdash;seriously straining the cash flow of small businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CollBox integrates with Xero's invoicing capabilities to allow small business owners to send overdue accounts to collections in just three clicks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our webapp identifies overdue accounts, instantly presents the best collection offer available from a network of effective, ethical debt collectors, and&mdash;once approved&mdash;directly transmits the account details and invoices to the collector so they can get to work immediately. Overdue invoices lose about 15% of their value every 30 days, so timing is of the essence!
                </p>
                <p>
                    CollBox sends notifications of changes in status as the collections process proceeds so the business owner is always up-to-date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial prototype of CollBox was built at a hackathon, so we're excited to be adding Xero integration during another hackathon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    CollBox is built in Clojure / ClojureScript, backed by Datomic. It runs entirely within Amazon AWS, leveraging Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, and SQS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't run into any serious challenges with this project. Once we had auth / request signing down, the rest was smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to be helping small businesses get paid for the hard work they've already put in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've already helped hundreds of businesses send thousands of past-due invoices to collections, and we're looking forward to increasing those numbers many fold by becoming a member of the Xero ecosystem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CollBox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for CollBox is getting listed in the Xero App Marketplace. Our integration is production-ready and will be rolled out ASAP. We're excited to get it into the hands of Xero users!
