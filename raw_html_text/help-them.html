                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the American Heart Association, 70 percent of Americans feel helpless to act during a cardiac emergency. A sudden medical emergency is something that is looked over by most us as it's something that doesn't happen everyday, however when it does occur, it has the potential to cause unnecessary damage or even death of a loved one. Therefore, there is need to educate normal people, like you and me, to act instantly and effectively.Statistically speaking, if called on to administer CPR in an emergency, the life you save is likely to be someone at home: a child, a spouse, a parent or a friend.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app follows a tree map like pattern. Once opened during an emergency, the app will ask a series of quick questions to assess the situation, decide what is the diagnosis is based responses and then give the caregiver exact instructions how to deal with the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end of the app is build using python and firebase. The medical information was provided by IMO's API. The firebase acts as a collection of all medical diagnosis and relevant question to come to a conclusion of what the issue is. The front end was built using Android Studio using native android development tools which uses java and xml.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the API provided by IMO to compute an effective diagnosis. Another challenge faced was to decide based on the medical data whether the emergency requires immediate medical attention or not.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all accomplished different milestones in the process of developing the app. It was first time both, Sagar and Somesh used firebase as as a data tool and the API provided by  IMO. It was also the first time Sanna developed an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us accomplished different goals as developers. We leaned to use firebase as a collection of medical diagnosis. We improved upon our skills in Android App development. We also learned to function as team of people with entirely different skill sets and knowledge backgrounds.

                    What's next for Help Them
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since Help Them is open-source, we hope to involve medical doctors and other professionals to expand the app. We hope to cover more diagnosis and effective ways of tackling them. We also plan to use a web-interface instead of a command line interface in the future to input medical diagnostic data.
