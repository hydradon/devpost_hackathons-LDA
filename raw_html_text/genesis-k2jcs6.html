                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Job search is difficult, especially for college students. This is especially true for entry level job searches with smaller companies.

                <h2>
                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Genesis is a platform to connect prospective employees to employers. The app requires you to enter your professional information (or login with LinkedIn) and matches you to potential jobs. Jobs can be either posted by employers or crawled from various websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform consists of three main parts. The web app, Chrome app and mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Web App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app has an easy interface to search for jobs and allows you to add them to your &ldquo;job interest&rdquo; list. You have the option to add jobs that do not exist in our database. The platform also allows user to host their professional profile and work history, and recommends jobs based on these information. Using machine learning algorithms, jobs can be recommended based on probability of acceptance/rejection and interest of the prospective employee. Employers may post their job positions through the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Mobile App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile app for this platform consists of a simple interface to either allow job search by criteria (similar to Google), or allow job search through a Tinder-like interface (where the user swipes left or right to indicate if they like a job or not). Users who swipe right (interested in job) will have their profile anonymously added to the employer&rsquo;s &ldquo;list of people who are interested in this job&rdquo;. The employer may look at the person&rsquo;s resume, and get back to the top 5 people who are interested in the job, allowing them to move forward (for an interview, for example). This makes organization a lot easier for employers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    QR codes can be generated for a job and printed to posters. People who take pictures of the QR code will be taken to the job listing page in the mobile app. QR codes are good for job fairs. Alternatively, connect to Ekco instead of QR code.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Marketing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The key to the success of this app is to have a large user base. With a large user base, employers are more likely to use the app to post job listings. The most difficult part is getting the large user base, as users will use the app only if there are a large amount of employers. This causes a dependency cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to solve this cycle, the app will provide a Chome extension to make the app useful at the early stage of launch despite having lack of job postings from employers. The Chrome extension will allow Chrome to automatically fill in applications online for the user. At the same time, the Chrome extension will also send data back to us on this job posting and automatically post it in our database. This will make the app useful as a tool to quickly apply to jobs without having to re-enter the same information on multiple applications (similar to CommonApp for colleges).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Monetization Strategy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Option A: The app will monetize by charging successful hires a percentage of the salary the employee makes.
Option B: The app will monetize by advertising job positions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using NodeJS backend and Ionic mobile front end. The website is not built as part of the prototype.
