                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our Cutiehack project, we wanted to do something that allowed us to utilize our introductory skills to the C++ language. We also combined our collective interest for personality quizzes and the Harry Potter series to create inspiration for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Sorting Hack is a quiz that determines your placement into one of the four houses in Hogwarts, a fictional wizarding school in the Harry Potter series.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many functions in C++ to create components for the quiz. We also used part of an HTML template and added some extra CSS and JS to make it look as it does. Lastly, we used IExpress to create executable files and an installer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to debug the program was a very tedious process, along with making questions that would fit the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to do something with our current programming knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should believe in ourselves more since we could create more than what we could think.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sorting Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to make a website for it so it can be available for download.
