                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    School means so much more than just sitting in class. It means clubs, games, service events&ndash;a whole laundry list of activities that we explore and enjoy, every day. Sometimes, we do so much that it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint every activity we have ever done throughout our four years of high school, especially when we sit down to write college applications. And sometimes, we just want to explore what else our school offers&ndash;we want to join the clubs that actually meet, the classes where we actually learn something. That&rsquo;s what Schoolar is for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schoolar is a hub of activities, a school community, and a resume, all-in-one. It&rsquo;s easy, elegant, and fun to use, with its sophisticated design and user-friendly interface. Each school has its own Schoolar Hub, with a unique database of what is relevant to students there. Schoolar currently focuses on three main categories&ndash;classes, clubs, and events. Upon creating an account, students fill in their class schedule, enabling them to connect to students in their classes and automatically listing those classes on their profile, which eventually becomes like a resume. The same can be done for clubs. Once students are official members of clubs or classes, they can review those for prospective members or students looking to join those. A five star rating scale provides a quick overview of what fellow students felt about certain classes or clubs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website was built with HTML/CSS, PHP, JSON and Javascript, while our ios application was made with Swift. We also included a section that was powered by the Watson API to use sentiment analysis to determine whether or not the general feeling of a series of reviews was positive (aka recommended) or negative (aka not recommended). This was a struggle because the Watson API was a complicated process and took up much of our time and energy.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a vision of what we wanted, but we had no idea where to start. Our ios application brought with it many challenges, such as certain pages not connecting. We wanted to implement a Javascript framework, but we had no prior experience, so it was all a learning process, but a fun one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our cohesive and useful concept that solves a problem that directly affects us every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Xcode and Javascript, as well as PHP. Most of us had no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schoolar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand Schoolar to high schools and colleges across the nation, and complete our ios and Android application.
