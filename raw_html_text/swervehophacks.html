                    Currently while traveling many will open up their favorite internet map projection and proceed to for the directions to their destination. However, a crucial piece of information is missing from the map: the crimes that normally occur in that area. We were tired of receiving directions to walk through areas in which murder or armed robbery occur frequently. Thus we built an overlay tool that allows people to know what types of crime occur in the area they are traveling and they can adjust their route accordingly . The backlog has a work ahead for creating a user input for crimes by using Facebook and Twitter posts.
