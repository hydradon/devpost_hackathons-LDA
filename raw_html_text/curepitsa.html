                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    two angry mobs clashing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your army clashes against the enmy army who's trying to destroy your kingdom. You revive dead soldiers, doctors and civilians who desperately try to overpower the enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a sketch of what it would look like and sort of build around that idea. This was picked/fused from a long list of different ideas. We wanted something simple but full of mayhem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to find one good idea for this timescale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reusing assets from failed ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we must come up with ideas faster and spot the actual fun mechanic. Understanding what ideas had the most potential proved to be really hard.
