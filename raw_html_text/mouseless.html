                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ways in which technology has changed the way we interact with the world and conduct our lives on a daily basis is monumental. It's hard to believe that some people aren't able to access and use the same technology that has made our lives so much easier. That's why we came up with the idea of Mouseless--a mouse-free way to browse the web that can aid those that are physically unable to operate a standard mouse. With the help of XESTO and Hack the North, we were given access to a Leap Motion Controller. This special piece of hardware allows its users to utilize hand and finger gestures as input that would be analogous
to a computer mouse or touchpad.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to browse webpages without using a mouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Leap Motion controller and it's available API's and libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some hardware incompatibility problems as well as some hardware API problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an application for social good that we hope will help many people. We learned to use a hardware that we've never used before. We also made our entire website in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to test out hardware before deciding to use it. We learned that just because an API for something exists doesn't mean it it the most effective way to accomplish our task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mouseless
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate this into Google Chrome as a browser extension, as well as integrate voice capabilities.
