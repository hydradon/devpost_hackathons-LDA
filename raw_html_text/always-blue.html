                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the innovations of industry leaders in Silicon Valley (hence our project title, a reference to the TV show of the same name). By utilizing modern frameworks, we crafted a prototype web application that can serve as a resource on various devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At this time the app has two main features: a chatbot which utilizes machine learning to provide answers to common questions (responses are offered in either English or Spanish based on the language of the asked question) and an interactive map which describes points of interest around the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we choose to use full-stack Javascript, using a minimal Express.js server on the server side, with React on the client side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We challenged ourselves to explore new technologies and approaches during this project by tackling web sockets using Socket.io, interactive maps with Leaflet, and an interactive chatbot using natural language processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to have the opportunity to participate in GlobalHack VII building an interesting app to help immigrants and exploring new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By making an effort to explore new technologies we got the change to see how those libraries perform in a semi-real life development environment.
