                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Metro by T-Mobile is rolling out new magnet stores. Among these are retail and dealer stores. In the magnet retail store, Metro is putting new demo tables. Some of these demo tables originally had coloring books. We wanted to continue Metro's interactive approach, while simultaneously engaging the kids with tablets. This would add new features and create a social environment in the larger magnet retail stores, while assisting the smaller staffs of the dealer store locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided the best way to do this was to build a suite of puzzle games that kids could access in store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The T-Puzzle app has two games. The first, developed for kids ages 6-9, is augmented reality T-Pong, which allows players to bounce the ball between two giant T-mobile Ts. For ages 10-12, we developed augmented reality T-Tetris, where the players can build tetris.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a major application that run on two different devices, Alyssia using AR Kit in Xcode, and Shankar used AR core in Unity, Alyssia coded in swift to create T-tetris, and Shankar coded in C# to create T-Pong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble programming the games. We worked with Keith at the event to overcome problems with gaming physics, and we also spent a lot of time learning how to set up the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were glad we were able to make working games under the time limit, especially since this was the first time our team members had made augmented reality applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shankar learned how to make applications in Unity when making T-Pong. Alyissa learned how to do gaming physics when building T-tetris. Addison learned how to do marketing research on child consumer marketing while working alongside the coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for T-Puzzle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, a fully realized T-Puzzle would be a suite of virtual and augmented reality games. With permission, Children 6-12 will be able to pick up any tablet or phone in the store and begin interacting with the Metro-store, regardless of store size through branded games.
