                    Hardware-wise, we went into this hackathon with little more than an Arduino Uno and a set of phone-repair tools. We knew we wanted to use the Arduino as an interface to communicate with a computer, so we set it up to send messages of the serial port based on sensor input. We fastened everything together with electrical tape and cardboard, and at one point had to replace a momentary switch with a rocker switch (which impacted the controls a bit). The hardware uses C++ to write a text file based on a log file of a serial monitor called Putty, which the Java program reads and uses for input.

                    For the software, we decided to build an Invaders style game with one turret that turns according to the input from the controller we made. The game and graphics are all made in Java. Keeping in the "Octocat" theme of the hackathon, we made an octocat to be the alien. You play it by turning the angle of you turret and shooting, if you miss 3, the game is over. When you hit one or it gets through, another one starts, it starts to get faster as your score gets higher.
