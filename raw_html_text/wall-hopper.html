                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flappy Bird inspired us to create a similar platform style game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where the player has to jump through pillars of varying lengths to increase their score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used textpad, JFrame, and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the runnable interface to get the objects to run smoothly over the course of the game

                <p>
                    The game runs smoothy and looks aesthetically-appealing to the user.

                <p>
                    We gained experience in JFrame and became comfortable with game design.
