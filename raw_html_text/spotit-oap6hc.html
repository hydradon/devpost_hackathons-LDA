                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our members have experienced a time where we walk around several study spaces across the massive Cornell campus to find a spot to study, only to see no open spaces and many disturbed looks from fellow students. We decided that it would be very useful and convenient if we could devise a website that updates students on the available study seats across the numerous libraries across campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website informs students of the hours of each library, as well as the number of open seats in each study room. Once the student gets seated in an open seat, they will log in with their Cornell NetID and indicate which seat they have taken. The system will then change the seat availability from open to closed, as well as update the ratio of open seats on the homepage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to design our website. We used HTML and CSS to design the website, and JavaScript to create the occupancy program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As newbies to the Hackathon world, we faced the challenge of having minimal experience in creating something from nothing. We had to look up numerous tutorials and constantly debug our programs in order to create our final product. In addition, we had to design our website with rough estimates of the layout of the room of the library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the fact that we were able to work collaboratively and develop a useful program that we hope one day will be used across college campuses nationwide. In addition, we believe that our idea appeals to a great majority of the student population here at Cornell.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a running website. More than anything, we learned to appreciate every aspect and feature of any website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spot It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following BigRed//Hacks, our group plans to continue developing the website as a personal project by adding more libraries to our database, adding an API to add a location feature, improving the aesthetics, and more. We also hope to be able to bring this up to the Cornell Information Technology Department and the Cornell Library Department so that students could have access to the website. If all of this becomes reality, we may even consider making an app!
