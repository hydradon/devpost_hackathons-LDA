                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think data is beautiful, and we wanted to help monitor our air quality. We attended the Louisville Open City Data workshop and thought the APIs looked cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Android app that displays the local AQI, or 'Air Quality Index' for health concerns. It can also calculate your average distance from 311 service calls all around the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Android Studio to build the app which uses various APIs from Louisville's Open Data website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importing data, the APIs were very inconsistent with how they returned their data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Got to finish our project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about and used Louisville's Open Data project, which was really cool.

                    What's next for Air Pollution Indicator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe better UI, or more interesting data visualizations/options.
