                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been trying to learn backend for a long time and decided to fully dedicate myself to learning RoR through Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial. I was able to cover over 130 pages of the 500-page book starting from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic structure is pretty simple. I generated a rails app using the rails new command. I used scaffolding to create a model for users that includes id (integer), name (string) and email (string). Likewise, I used scaffolding to create a model for microposts that included id (integer), content (text), and user_id (integer). Each microposts has a single user_id which connects it to a specific user. Meanwhile, a user can have as many microposts associated with it as possible.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would have been able to cover more too if I didn't have problems with setting up Rails on my mac because I upgraded to El Capitan. I had to back up my data and downgrade to Yosemite and reinstall Rails. After 2 complete factory resets, I was able to get Rails and Ruby set up on my computer by 2pm on Saturday.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've known some basic front-end for a long time but have been really meaning to sit down and dedicate myself to learning a programming language. I've taken programming classes but this is the first time where I'm actually building something from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model-view-controller structure is pretty intuitive and I like that rails comes packaged with so many elements so I can get working immediately. I hope I come to understand all of these elements really in-depth over time.

                <p>
                    I am going to finish the rest of the book over the next week and then start working on a project I've had in mind for a while.
