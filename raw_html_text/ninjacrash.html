                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shelters have a hard time managing all of the users that come through their doors. We wanted to help facilitate this process through a centralized platform for all shelters to monitor their capacities and those of nearby shelters to provide the best service to those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple sign up for end-users to enable tracking of shelter resources and needs to be met in the right way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A jQuery and static nginx front-end backed by a strongly typed Go backend for application layer services when PostgREST services on top of our PostgreSQL database do not provide functionality required. Additionally R for machine learning to understand what makes a person at-risk for homelessness. All built in the Amazon Cloud with EC2 and RDS resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CORS + Go services clashing with nginx setup resulting in multiple headers overlapping and causing errors in the frontend. Tackled through specific header setup for the go services themselves and a highly permissive postgREST layer.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Lots of "first time evers" for the team:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Go language in general much-less http services for application logic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Machine learning for an unfamiliar set of data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data Generation for large sets of data with reasonable values (e.g. Lat/Long)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data is not clean, clear, or gathered in a consistent manner when it comes to this subject. Even simple, easily accessible CRUD apps with a strong infrastructure backing could make a big difference.
