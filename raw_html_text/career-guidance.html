                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often, students in college are confused about what they should do to achieve their dream career. Typically they have to take up courses, try them and then decide whether that helps their career path or not. What we wish to accomplish is take existing student's data who are in the said dream position and suggest and recommend courses and skills to take on for achieving what they want to. Hence, making their life less stressful by showing existing examples of successful seniors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collected data from Handshake and filtered work experience, position held, skills and past courses taken. Learns and categorizes them into different career paths and classes. Visualizes career path for a new student recommended based on their interests and goals by matching them with the ones in the database. Shows them which courses to take and skills to develop.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used python requests API to fetch data from Handshake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stored the data into MongoDB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cleaned the data using python scripts to extract only the essential information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use Microsoft Azure Power Business Intelligence API for visualization but after numerous attempts we could not get it running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Handshake doesn't provide a very robust API to easily fetch data. Had to download a lot of junk data and then clean it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After data cleaning need to enumerate it to plot and visualize it and input it to a learning model.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, got an exhaustive dataset with a lot of useful information that can be quite helpful for both by students as well as career services.

                <p>
                    A little bit about the Azure cloud platform.

                    Explored Google Data Studio.
