                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an application that allowed T-Mobile to better serve their customers and enhance their experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product provides an interface for customer service reps, which allows them to automatically have their call transcribed in real time, have sentiment analysis performed on to assess the customer's satisfaction, and view statistics which show them how they are performing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, Javascript, IBM-Watson
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of us had experience, with Javascript and HTML, which made it difficult for all of us to be collaborating at the same time. None of us had experience with UX/UI, making our project a real challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned various Web Development tools, such as Electron, ReactJS, HTML, Javascript, and many more.
