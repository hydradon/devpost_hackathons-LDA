                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always amazing to see the talent of people performing in subway stations. For some it's a hobby but for many it's the way they make their living. We wanted to ensure that as many riders as possible can be engaged in the way these performers deserve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Subway performers can login and create a profile, where they can post when/where they are performing on the subway line. Users can browse artist pages as they come across them during their commute. Users can read about each artist by tapping on an interactive subway map. The application will provide a platform for tipping as well.
                </p>

                    This originally was mobile app but we had challenges with swift.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a mobile app with more features.
