                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking for a interesting ways to serve beverages in a social setting. We thought that it would be a fun and challenging project and it was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BARisimo presents an innovative way to enjoy drinks by connecting a drinking mixing robot to the internet. It dispenses a variety of drinks by employing peristaltic pumps. We've designed BARisimo to be compatible with any reservoir of liquid regardless of its shape. Be it a wine bottle, a 2L soda bottle, or a mixer (like milk?), BARisimo can dispense it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've created a simple interface to interact with BARisimo in a variety of ways. For example, we can have crowd-sourced drink combinations through connecting with Twitch (a streaming website) or a simple drink queue through a web app. .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BARisimo was built at MakeMIT 2016, a hardware hackathon over the course of the day by a team of 5 hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to design all of BARisimo from the ground up. Our first task was to create peristaltic pumps. Our initial design was intended for 3D printing, but after getting a projected print time of 16 hours for a single pump, we decided to switch routes and create a laser cut design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to scrap some of BARisimo's features in the interest of time, but we had created a robust enough design initially that the performance of the concept of BARisimo is still intact as originally intended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build beautiful 80/20 structures.
We made a clean CAD assembly in SolidWorks.
We designed our own peristaltic pumps, not only once, but twice!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to design our own pumps and build them from the ground up. 
How to be resourceful and create robust, adaptable design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BARisimo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing all of the features we had left behind earlier today. We'd like to include a mixing container with actuated dispensing and an extra tank for water to clean out this reservoir and the machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to interface with Amazon Echo's Alexa in the future.
