                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the web for 600 questions related to sexual education and tailored it to the middle school age range and also made it fun using original stickers of Madeline.  In addition, we have Google Cloud API to translate all messages into the native language of the user and we use the UN refugee agency database to find local NGO's.
                </p>
