                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for an ultimate guide to lose weight without choosing a random diet plan that I can't fully trust based on conflicting science and research. So I went ahead and found an article explaining how fatloss ultimately works and what steps should I take to have my diet in check with what I need to lose weight with: calorie deficit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fatlossry is able to take your weight and lifestyle / food diet and create the optimum calorie deficit and macro nutrients plan to help you moderate your current diet to enable you to lose weight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because I am really new to JavaScript, I used JS to build this app along with some basic HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had this idea in my brain a bit too late into the hackathon and so I could not complete every step I wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made something that I will be using and I know what I have learned so far in JavaScript and what I hope to implement in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fatlossry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to later enhance Fatlossry to be the go to meal planning and diet app that doesn't track calories at a micro level like myfitnesspal but rather integrates your active lifestyle with your weight as time passes to show you your progress and sorta gamify the experience of losing weight and becoming healthier
