                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help the army gain more experience in detecting enemies and shooting at them. However, practicing this infield can be expensive and also exposes soldiers in an environment that they can easily be injured. Thus, we want to develop a virtual reality app that can help soldiers practice such action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application we built enables soldiers using SAMSUNG Gear VR to practice detecting enemies and shooting at them. The app enables soldiers to select multiple scenarios and practice in them. The time they accomplish the tasks (detecting enemies and shoot at them) will be recorded and will be presented at the end of each trial of training.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way we built it is using the Unity 3D engine as the modeling engine. We built the practice field and the displaying chart using the application. Then, we created apk for the software so that the software can be used on Gear VR with a phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges that there is a lot of duplication code in the code provided and also we failed to present the data clearly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We fixed the problem of not displaying data properly and all the data will be presented on a chart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deal with legacy code and how to utilize Unity 3D to fulfill our aim.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don't hesitate to die for the country
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will include more sensors to support more data input (for example, sensors that detects blood pressure). Thus, our data will be more comprehensive and soldiers will be able to analyze their performance during practice better.
