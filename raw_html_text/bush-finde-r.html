                    Bush finder was inspired by the humanitarian crisis in India, where many people are forced to defecate in the open because lack of toilets in some areas. Bush Finder is meant to help reduce usage of fouled or suboptimal ground in areas without toilets, and point the way to places that do have toilets -- hopefully reducing open defecation.

                    Of course the development of this service came with unique challenges: How do we locate toilets? How do we find paths to them? 
To solve this, we used Google maps, which is web and android compatible. We're proud to say this service is an attractive proof of concept for an unattractive activity. We learned that simpler projects and solutions are to be preferred over difficult ones, and that there is a lot of humanitarian work hackers can do if put to the task.
