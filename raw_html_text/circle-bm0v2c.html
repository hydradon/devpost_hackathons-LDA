                    My project is a command line argument program built in Java to solve the challenge provided by The Thinking Ape in Hackathon.  This program was built using Eclipse Luna IDE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HOW IT WORKS:
A message will be printed at the command line asking you to provide the number of people in the Circle.  You just have to type an integer number and press enter and program will print the answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
To solve the challenge I implemented a circular list that redefines who is the first person in every deletion.  The new first person is always the one that follows the other that just have been removed from the circle.  Thus, the delete operation will always pick correct current second person of the circle.
