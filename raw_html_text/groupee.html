                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the people who...
Only go to the gym if the right person is leading the spin class
Only get their coffee from a single barista
Only go to the bar if their bartender is in
Will only listen to a certain band at a venue
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all those people who need that special service, there's Groupee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Groupers are people who have a following.  They register their "locations" with the Groupee service.  Groupee uses Sense360 geo regions to determine when a Grouper enters or leaves one of their zones - all seamlessly.  Groupees can follow Groupers and be alerted when their special provider is working.  They get push notifications and a visual presentation of the status of their Groupers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a massive amount of code for one person in just 24 hours.  Lots of pieces to integrate and get working.  Having a bunch of asynchronous services was a little challenging to debug.  The biggest challenge was time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The service works!  I got a full validation of the process and can see it working on multiple devices simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up push notifications with Parse is still a pain.  The Sense360 integration was very straightforward - no issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Groupee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely can be commercialized.  Needs a real back-end, front end polish, and a few whizzy features and it's there.
