                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work on a VR project as a learning experience, as no one on our team had any experience with VR or with Unity or C# development. We decided to make a fun game that put a light spin on a serious issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game puts you in the role of an intergalactic cop spraying harassing aliens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our utter unfamiliarity with Unity and C# led to a lot of learning - the first ~20 hours were spent just trying to figure out how things worked. We ran out of time to figure out how to get our creepy aliens to say creepy stuff - their audio is either too quiet or not playing at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a functioning VR app that lets you zap creepy aliens. Working with Unity, Oculus, and C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about proper scope management for a 36 hour hackathon project; namely, what might be too much to bite off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hack Harassment: In Space!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to implement a stronger anti-harassment message. As it stands, our program has a few mentions of harassment but we don't really show why it's an issue or portray the aliens as especially harassing.
