                    We wanted to use the Muse brain headband to make a red or green LED light glow when the wearer was thinking of red or green. This is the first step towards that goal. We were able to use scikit to create a classifier for data provided by the headband. We faced issues with directly streaming the data, as we would need to convert each .muse file to a .csv file, a process which would take too long. This was an unfortunate hurdle, however, we were still able to accomplish a good amount of what we set out to do, despite never being able to get the streaming to work.
