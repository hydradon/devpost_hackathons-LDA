                <p>
                    We wanted people to be able to experience real home food from all sorts of different cultures

                    What it does

                <p>
                    FOGO connects customers looking for a genuine taste of ethnic foods from around the world to aspiring chefs looking for a reliable source of secondary income

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used both java and kotlin in android studio to build a semi-functional app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with android studio, or any app-development software for that matter, and we were forced to learn all the classes and methods from scratch. We also ran into a large amount of bugs that took us a while to resolve due to our lack of experience. Finally, this was our first actual hackathon, and it was quite different from other competitions we have competed in ( it was still a lot of fun though :) )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio, while challenging, was really fun to code with, and we enjoyed the versatility and extensiveness of the software once we got used to it. Also this was our first app, and while we didn't quite reach our goal of near-full functionality, it definitely inspired us to create more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that a hackathon takes a lot of stamina! It was extremely confusing to find a viable topic, and also tiring to keep coding through the night. We also learned a lot about using Android Studio, which we can hopefully apply to any apps we want to create in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FOGO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can continue to develop our apps functionality and eventually bring it to market on both Google play and the App Store. I really am inspired by this app, it has been on my mind for a while now, and the fact that we were able to get so far in a day shows that we can really make this idea a reality.
