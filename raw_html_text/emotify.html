                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since emojis have been found to be a better tool to convey emotions rather than text, It is preferable to use them as a tool to retrieve related songs and music tracks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Application receives a set of emojis from users and find the most related songs to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A combinations of emojis descriptions and all corresponding html files are used as inputs for our python code. The code then uses cosine similarity algorithm to find a term with the highest probability of returning a song. For this purpose, the code is using a set of keywords with different weights to return the most accurate combination of emojis descriptions.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, Due to lack of a clean database containing emojis and corresponding descriptions, we had to clean a database to generate a new database to be used in our project. Second, producing a set of keywords has a critical importance for accurate suggestion.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited to have been able to successfully implement an application giving users music related emojis.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use C#  and python to create on the fly application.

                    What's next for Emotify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would add a feature to give feedback to user to improve the results over time.
