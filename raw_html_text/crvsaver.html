                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day I thought about making some money, and what came to mind was cashing in lots of CRV bottles. However when I went to the recycling center near me it was out of the way, stinky, and the line was quite long.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a system that finds the nearest bins by CRVSaver. The bins are not physically present now, but we imagine that there will be a system of bins that you can collect your CRV conveniently from. Theoretically, we spread lots of bins out like Lime-e bikes, allowing people to cash in their bottles for money. This goes along with our CRVSaver website.
