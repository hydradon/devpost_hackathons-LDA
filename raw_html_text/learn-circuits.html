                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Circuits can be a challenging subject. Our team plans to change this by adding a more hands on, interactive, and fun way of learning.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empowering teachers with a new way to deliver knowledge to an entire classroom of students while being able to monitor each students progress throughout the lessons.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining Unity and Vuforia creates the visual portion of the project. The cross communication between Unity, a web server, and a desktop application composes of the backbone of the project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project turned out WAY more challenging than expected. Throughout the Hackathon, we faced difficulties with libraries, faulty microcontrollers we couldn't use, and converting an algorithm we wrote from one language to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the unity application deployed on a phone. It features a menu able to traverse through the lesson plans and create a user ID.
Another accomplishment was the monitoring application deployed on a desktop to neatly display each students progress and current status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aerospace engineer on the team learned a LOT about coding. Making progress checks of the overall scope of our project helped keep all team members on track and on the same page. When someone hit a road block, we all were ready to help think of a solution or another way around the problem.
