                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it's hard to get someone to help you move a couch unless you know a lot of people. Or maybe you need someone to help you mount a TV on a wall. Whatever the reason, we wanted an easy way of getting help with small tasks that require a quick helping hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two different Android apps, one for posters, and one for doers.
Posters can create job listings which will appear for doers to browse. If a Doer selected one of the Poster's jobs, the Poster will be notified and that job will move into a "claimed" list. Once the Doer has finished the job, the Poster can close out that job from their "claimed" list and pay their friendly fellow human being.
                </p>

                    How to really take advantage of the real-time database offered by Firebase. It's a wonderful tool. We learned about user experience flow. We also figured out how to quickly integrate many API services without too much spaghetti code!

                <p>
                    Allowing Posters to add additional information to their job postings to make it easier for Doers to decide whether they would like to do that task. For example, time range when it needs to be done, estimated length of time, location, and several other pieces of useful information. Also having an archive of past jobs completed for both Posters and Doers would be useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Sign-in is something we'd like to add that isn't too hard to do but we just don't have time. It would allow users to have profiles to keep histories of their jobs as well as have preferences and we can use the analytics to not match users again if they've had bad experiences with one another.
