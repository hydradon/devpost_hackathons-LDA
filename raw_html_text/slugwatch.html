                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are frustrated by the absence of banana slugs on our campus. We have gone through our first quarter of college without seeing our beloved mascot, the banana slug. Our app incorporates the idea that not only helps our peers sight banana slugs, but it also acts as a community builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If someone is walking out and about on our campus and sees a banana slug, using SlugWatch they can alert their fellow student body about it and enabling their peers to see it. They can mark their location, allowing people to locate and travel to the banana slug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed SlugWatch on the Android Studio application. SlugWatch incorporates Google Maps, in order to pin point the location of the slug sighting, as well as the built-in camera, to allow the user to upload a photo of the banana slug.
