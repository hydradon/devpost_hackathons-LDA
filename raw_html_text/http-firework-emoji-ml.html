                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A while ago, I was looking for a unique domain name, and I discovered that the registrar for .ml domain names does not follow the security rules restricting Unicode domains. I got 🎆.ml and firework.ml and have been planning on doing something with them ever since.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically just a multi-player fireworks simulator. When you load the page, you're assigned a launching point, and then you click to launch fireworks. Other people will see the fireworks that you launch on their screens, and you'll see their fireworks too.
If 🎆.ml is too hard to type into your browser, you can also go to firework.ml, which will redirect you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's mostly a static website, with the fireworks rendered on a canvas by javascript, but I use SignalR and OWIN/ASP.NET running on Azure for the WebSockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Support for Unicode on the web is not perfect. Azure has a bug that prevents it from hosting the site, but GitHub pages is able to host it. Devpost won't let me type the real domain name anywhere.
Also, in order to prevent malicious users from creating Unicode domains that look virtually identical to ASCII domains, most browsers won't show the Unicode character in the URL bar. Still, it's pretty cool that you can get there by typing in 🎆.ml.
