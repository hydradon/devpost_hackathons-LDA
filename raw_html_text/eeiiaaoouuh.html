                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you know the movie "Guardians of the Galaxy"? In it, there is a bad-ass ravager, Yondu, who commands a deadly arrow just by whistling. We wanted that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have managed to build a library for recognizing whistles even in noisy environments, and have built three harmonizing games on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used some basic processing on the FFT supplied by the AnalyzerNodes in the Web Audio API, and used jaws.js to build nice games around it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one, there was the challenge of processing the audio properly. Also, the inputs supplied by whistling were very different from any input we have worked before. Finally, whistling varies from person to person: we had to set up a way to adjust to each person's sound signature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of having put together such efficient (reasonably fast and with good noise immunity) signal processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we got much better at working quickly and efficiently in a team.
                </p>

                    What's next for eeiiaaoouuh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably, we should polish it up greatly, and possibly, we should unify the visual style of the game. We also have plans to connect multiple input devices via WiFi
