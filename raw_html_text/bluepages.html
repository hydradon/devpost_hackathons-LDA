                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen, we have all recently experienced the struggle of making connections with other students on campus. We hope that our app will make it easy for all students to find friends and study mates that they wouldn't have found otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app asks the user to create an account with some information about themself, then uses that data to find other registered students with similar interests. This way, students can simplify and expedite the process of finding people on campus with similar interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the language Dart, and specifically libraries Flutter and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having much prior familiarity with the language or libraries we were using, we faced a number of challenges getting the software to perform how we wanted.
                </p>

                    What's next for BluePages
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving on existing functionality (refining search parameters, making match algorithm more intelligent), and expanding to further capabilities and features (expanding past Brandeis, supporting matching for non-academic interests)
