                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of students like us face difficulties in managing time during their hectic university schedules. 
They also don't have time to sit down and manage their calendars. 
Depression caused due to ineffective time management skills, is making the students in this advanced developing generation weak.
88% of the college students want to increase their ability to manage time but could not even get some time out to sit with their calendar.
Mental health is the best solution for social good.
In this decade of extreme depression and social Pessimism, we wanted to create something for social good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application- MyTMA is a time management tool for students to create effective calendars, inculcate healthy habit and 
optimize time utilization for fitness/mental health/entertainment without losing the focus on their priority i.e. academics. 
It is a user friendly application with a lot of innovative features.It's features include: accessing the user location and finding relevant events using ticket master API, using a google calendar API for adding or cancelling events in the calendar format, using machine learning for object detection (text detection to be specific) and natural language processing, and creating an automatic scheduling algorithm. All these features have been integrated using a convenient pipeline.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rome was not built in a day and so wasn't our app. We started by setting up a cloud online for machine learning and text detection. Two of us were focused on the front end and the rest were working on the back end. We used google calendar to fetch the data, used google authentication, used java script to make API calls on the back end and integrated all the features built in a suitable user friendly pipeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the front end with the back end was the major challenge that we faced while creating this web app.
Creating the calendar UI and populating the calendar data was another problem that we were stuck on. Due to this critical issue, half way through the hackathon  we actually thought of pivoting but we stayed determined and overcame our problem through mutual cooperation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud and happy of our team effort for building this web app. The planning and the passionate willingness for exploring new libraries for integration of codes is a dedicated tiresome job. We are proud to have done it throughout the Hackathon. Balancing breaks, codes and designing is the key for efficient projects. We are truly content in successfully doing it. The curiosity that this project has sparked in our vigilant minds is precious and would be the driving force for us to work on it further.

                <p>
                    After working as a team for 36 hours, we learnt collective decision making, effective communication, teamwork, planning and learning new technologies by helping each other.
