                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all played video games for a long time and making video games is a lot of fun and very challenging. We decided that we wanted to make a game before the hackathon even arrived so we started brainstorming ideas. With the conflict between Youtuber PewDiePie and TSeries we decided to make a game based around the two fighting each other. We weren't sure whether we would be making a platformer, idle game, or something else entirely. After experimenting, we settled on a simple space invaders style game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you start the game you are welcomed by a nice 8-bit graphics menu. When you start the game you are put into a level where you get to play as PewDiePie to fight TSeries bots. When you destroy bots you get money to use when you finish the level to buy upgrades which make it easier to play subsequent levels. Although your power scales with upgrades, T Series bots also get stronger over time making it harder and harder until they overpower PewDiePie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big part of our game was the graphics. We split up to make a bunch of sprites for the game that we could use later for upgrades characters, etc. We then went into Eclipse with pydev so we could code in Python. For most of our graphics we used a library called pygame which make graphics easy and smooth in Python. We added the sprites and coded mechanics like shooting, moving, upgrading, leveling up and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The images we used had to be manually adjusted into the game making it really hard to adjust the numbers to make the game look symmetric and clean. Also, a lot of the formulas we used ended up making the game unbalanced so we had to spend a lot of time tweaking the formulas to make sure that money, damage, and speeds were balanced so the game wouldn't be too hard or easy. Another big issue we ran into was object collisions. Since our images had a larger collision size than the visual size of the image, we had to manuals adjust all the collision sizes for each object. It took a long time and a lot of hard work, but it was completely worth it.
                </p>

                    The ability to effectively collaborate and create a polished product was very satisfying. It's hard to code one project with four people, but we were able to split up the work by assigning certain tasks, such as creating classes or making graphics, to different people. Being able to implement so many different things into one game was also a huge accomplishment. We included a currency system, upgrade system, leveling system, damage system, and more.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together. Under a time crunch, making such a daunting project causes some people to get stressed or nervous, but we were calm and collected and didn't crack under the pressure. We set out with a specific goal in mind and focused on not only completing it, but going above and beyond which was really worthwhile.
