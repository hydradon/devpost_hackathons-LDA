                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that this was a quick and easy way to create a reminder without the need of another app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using twilio, you can send a message with the reminder time to the phone number. 10 minutes before the time indicated in the text sent, it will send you a reminder text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the twilio API along with python and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this hackathon without knowing anything about flask, python, or any of the APIs. We used a lot of the time understanding the basics to python while implementing flask and the twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to create this hack and learning how to use flask and twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of how flask and servers worked. Also learned the python language. We also learned how to get our own domains by using ngrok.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RemindTxt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further develop this hack so that it can utilize pictures and phone calls. Also that make it possible to edit reminders.
