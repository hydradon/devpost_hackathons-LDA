                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that many people who are in need of resources are unable to effectively connect with those who are providing the resources, and providers of resources have no way to communicate which items they actually need from the community.  We set out to fix these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CU ConnectAid is a free web-based platform connecting providers, supporters, and recipients of aid in the Champaign-Urbana community. We provide a robust interface to track inventories, hours of operation, donation histories and more in order to better connect donors with donees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CU ConnectAid uses a ticket system to keep track of every transaction between the community, providers, and those in need.  It allows providers to keep track of what they&rsquo;ve received and what they&rsquo;ve distributed, the community to keep track of their donations, and those in need to keep track of items they&rsquo;ve received and items they need.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our limited timeframe meant that our project, which was a bit too ambitious, could not be fully fleshed out.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to integrate our database with our Flask-based front end, which allowed us to have a dynamic and reactive website.
