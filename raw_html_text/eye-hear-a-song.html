                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I really enjoy listening to music, and to me visualizing audio always seemed like an interesting way to add to the experience.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eye Hear A Song is a music visualizer. It allows users to select from a list of songs to play, and then displays visual output on a canvas in real time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built on Node.js, is styled with HTML and CSS, and makes use of webaudiox.js to parse audio, which are a series of helper functions for the WebAudio API.  It is hosted by Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first project I've made with Node.js, as well as the first time I've configured a Heroku app. This made the development process take quite a long time, but overall it was a good learning experience.
The API I used to parse audio files made it difficult to implement client-side file uploads. Thus, server side features will be added in the future to accommodate file uploads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eye Hear A Song
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was originally meant to be a platform for sharing music between friends. In the future, users should have the ability to upload their own favourite songs for others to listen to.
