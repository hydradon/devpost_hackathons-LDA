                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as team members shared a common problem: playing Spotify(R) music. The music is protected by a controversial technology called Encrypted Media Extensions. This DRM technique limits a user's freedom. One will find it difficult to use DRM-protected contents in Firefox and its variants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    De-tour is a web crawler that finds non-DRM media by looking up meta search engines, internet archives, and crowd funding platforms. It automates the complicated search process for DRM-free media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built De-tour with free software, and it is written in python3, Javascript, HTML and CSS. First, we wrote the crawlers to extract results from HTML pages. Then, we used a pool of threads and WebSocket to reduce latency. Finally, we built the style sheet to make it look pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with WebSocket, and we had to deal with latency problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked out the WebSocket client and the server. This was something that was totally new to us, but we managed to use it effectively in our project. We are also proud of our ideas, since it is something out of the box and we were able to simplify the process of finding non-DRM media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use WebSocket, which is often hard to work with. We also learned to use atomic message queues to write concurrent programs more carefully. We also learned to use git commands to merge our work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for De-tour
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a team are going to make detour free software more accessible, and make it more efficient.
