                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current sensor framework deals with the problem of diverse SoC platforms and their connected sensors. The problem is how to harvest and present the data in a way that is understandable even to a layman without having him/her to undergo the intricacies of connecting and mining data from a digital sensor connected to the SoC. In the present day there exists no such open source unified framework that offers to do the above. A lot of solutions do exist that are either restricted to a given platform and vendor specific or are proprietary.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide a way to visualize, mine and share the data extracted from SoC platforms. Being able to display information about the SoC and to present a standard API for developers and provide access to the data given the developer is connected to the same network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Central Server Infrastructure: which supports HTTP requests for sensor and platform registration and sockets for streaming the data in real time
b) Client programmes with GPIO support: This will directly merge with the client programmes that do the actual data gathering from the sensors.
 c) Sample Ecosystem: This will primarily involve the testing of the above two infrastructure with a broad range of platforms (the SoC&rsquo;s) and sensors for validation.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extracting the sensor data. Setting up the sever to stream the data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a working prototype of the idea. Able to stream the live data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to configure the node server and live stream data.
                </p>

                    What's next for Gamads
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future scope of the project largely involves the standardization of the API along with expansion of the prototype to different type of devices. We are also looking at extending this platform for a social cause such as of being of aid to physically handicapped people. The standardization of the API can be achieved only once there is decent array of sensor&rsquo;s that is tried and tested with different platforms
