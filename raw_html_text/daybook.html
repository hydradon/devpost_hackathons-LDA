                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was frustrated by the lack of decent journal applications that felt great to use, and we were also intrigued by the sentiment analysis APIs provided, so we decided to make a mood journal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a journal webapp that primarily works through desktop scrolling, and sentiment is extracted from the journal and changes the background dynamically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Daybook is a single page app built off of React, with use of Firebase as a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges getting used to React as not all of us had webdev experience, and playing around with Firebase and other APIs was a great lesson on working with outside APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to say that while we weren't able to get sentiment analysis up and running at the time of this devpost, we were able to build a fairly complex webapp integrating React and Firebase, which is great considering most of us did not have any prior web-dev experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team learned a lot about web-dev at this competition, as well as how challenging it can be to integrate different parts of an app together when they've been worked on separately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daybook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long term, after getting sentiment analysis truly working, we'd like Daybook to include analytics of your mood, so you can see how happy, sad, angry, etc. you've been over time, and so that we can tailor offerings to people based on their mood.
