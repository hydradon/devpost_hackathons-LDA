                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a frequent traveler, I&acute;ve been struggling with getting accurate information fast about the places I&acute;ll visit and how to get the right clothes for the right weather conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the capabilities for a human-like dialog and all the features for voice shaping in Alexa, I&acute;m convinced that a much better way to assemble your luggage can be achieved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just tell Alexa where are you going, for how many days and the type of trip (Business or Tourism, by Plane or Train) and
                    <strong>
                        ImaguSmartTravel
                    </strong>
                    would assemble and read a packing list meeting the local weather and baggage policies enforced by the transport company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Even more, the use can feedback information to the application and the packing list will adapt to his/her liking.
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application customizes the experience by recognizing the user, providing additional information about sightseeing activities and landmarks to visit on your destination and making sure that information is delivered to you easily (either by the Echo or listed on the Alexa App).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making sure that we understood directives correctly was critical due to the conversational nature of the application and the demand for Render-Templates on our Echo Show development.
Making sure that our selection of S3 and DynamoDB storage could scale to meet demand was tough, since we focused on preserving our innovative randomly generated interactions on complex configuration files.
English is not our native language so triggering the right Skill in echosim.io was quite funny and time-consuming at times.
