                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was biking in the gym one day and a song came on that had the same BPM as my RPM. I was really good, but didn't happen enough, so I built an app that made it happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rhythm senses how fast you're walking or pedalling and plays songs from your music library at the same BPM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built in xcode using Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iPhone pedometer only updates to your pace from 10 seconds ago, so you need to maintain a new pace for 10 seconds for Rhythm to update.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never built anything using Swift before, so I'm proud that I even got this working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about iOS development and how useful it is for developing code that you can test on your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rhythm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write a different pedometer function that tracks your speed up to the minute, so BPM changes can be detected easier.
                </p>
