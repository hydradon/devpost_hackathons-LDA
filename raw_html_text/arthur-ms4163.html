                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took geocaching and took an AR approach, as well as added some community building features in the form of a game. Keeps the treasure-hunting experience, but enhances the experience by incorporating AR.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a treasure hunt AR experience for the community. Users can create their own puzzles and clues for other users to follow in order to find treasures in the AR world. Features such as leaderboards and point tracking/leveling systems

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used JavaScript for the mobile/web side
C# in Unity for the AR side
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is constantly changing and updating, many assets that were once working last week may have changed, and that's what happened to us, so we had to find workarounds to accommodate for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AR functionality is growing and incorporating this into our project was one of our biggest goals. The mobile/web version is the forefront for how our users will be innovative with their challenges and puzzles.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There can be a lot of challenges to coding when dealing with programs that are constantly being updated, and it's pretty reflective of the constantly advancing field. It's an important aspect to be able to adapt and learn as we go.
