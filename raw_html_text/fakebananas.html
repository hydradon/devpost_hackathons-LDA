Newer versions of TensorFlow may work, but certainly not 'out of the box'.

                <h2>
                    How this works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our fake news detection is based on the concept of
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            stance detection
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    .  Fake news is tough to identify. Many 'facts' are highly complex and difficult to check, or exist on a 'continuum of truth' or are compound sentences with fact and fiction overlapping.  The best way to attack this problem is not through fact checking, but by comparing how reputable sources feel about a claim.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Users input a claim like
                        <em>
                            "The Afghanistan war was bad for the world"
                        </em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our program will search the thousands of global and local news sources for their 'stance' on that topic.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We run sources through our Reputability Algorithm. If lots of reputable sources all agree with your claim, then it's probably true!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we cite our sources so our users can click through and read more about that topic!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    News Sources
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After combing through numerous newspaper and natural language processing APIs, I discovered that the best way to find related articles is by searching for keywords. The challenge was implementing a natural language processing algorithm that extracted the most relevant keywords that were searchable, and to extract just the right number of keywords. Many algorithms were simply summarizers, and would return well over 50 keywords, which would be too many to search with. On top of that, many algorithms were resource exhaustive and would sometimes take up to a minute to parse a given text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, I implemented both Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure and IBM&rsquo;s Watson to process, parse, and extract keywords given the URL to a news article or a claim. I passed the extracted keywords to Event Registry&rsquo;s incredible database of almost 200 million articles to find as many related articles as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With more time, I would love to implement Event Registry&rsquo;s data visualization capabilities which include generating tag clouds and graphs showing top news publishers given a topic.

                    Determining Reputation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using a large set of default sources with hard coded reputability, our database of sources continues to become more accurate with each web scraping by adding new sources and articles. To ensure this makes our algorithm better, the weights of each source are adjusted according to how much each new article agrees or disagrees with sources determined to be reputable. In the future, we would love to implement deep learning to further advance this &lsquo;learning&rsquo; aspect of our reputability, but the current system more than supplies a proof of concept.

                <p>
                    To determine if a claim is true or false, we go out and see where sources which are known to be reputable stand on that issue.  We do this by leaning on established machine learning principles used for 'stance detection.'  So we:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ask the user to input a claim (which holds a 'stance') on a topic.  A claim might be "ISIS has developed the technology to fire missiles at the International Space Station."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We search databases, and scrape web pages, to find other articles on that issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then run our 'stance detection' machine learning algorithm to determine if reputable sources generally agree or generally disagree with that claim.
                        <em>
                            If many reputable sources all agree with a claim, then it's probably true!

                    Some teams try to train machine learning models on sets of 'fake' articles and sets of 'real' articles.  This method is terrible because fake news can appear in well written articles and vice versa!  Style is not equal to content and we care about finding true content.

                <p>
                    Some teams try to granularly check the truth of each fact in an article. This is interesting, and may ultimately be a part of some future fake news detection system, but today this method is not feasible. The truth of facts exists on a continuum and relies heavily on the nuance of individual words and their connotations. The nuances of human language are difficult to parse into true/false dichotomies.
