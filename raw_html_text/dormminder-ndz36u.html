                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from the need to control your room dorm remotely,

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a Hall Effect sensor and a light sensor,

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Thunderboard Sense 2 by Silicon Labs to gather environmental data. We built a sample dorm room door out of wood and

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially attempted to use different types of sensors hooked up to an Arduino UNO, but we had space constraints. We also had trouble finishing the frame of the door

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Raspberry Pi to read data from the Thunderboard, and getting the servo motor to push the door.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about different APIs and tools for developers offered by companies like Silicon Labs and Myo.

                <p>
                    We plan on implementing more features, like detecting whether you left your window open on a rainy day using a relative humidity sensor.
