                    Currently, NJIT's 25Live calendar forces students to wade through a long list of events to decide which are interesting to them.  Thus far, the only solution I found to organize this information on a mobile device is to use a third-party calendar app to tediously copy each preferred event into another calendar.

                <p>
                    The goal of the NJIT Events app is to enable users to simply tap on events they find interesting (copying the events in the background), or swipe them to hide them.
