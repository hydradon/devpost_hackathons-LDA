                    While on the bus on our way to the Hackathon, we watched the movie Lion (2016). This showed us the huge problems refugees and their families experience when they are constantly separated with little to no way of reconnecting with one another.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web-app that takes a photograph of a user using the computers webcam. It then compares the pictures to current pictures stored in our database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it finds a match, it will output the known information of the individual in the photo, if not, then it will create a prompt for the user to input information about the person in the picture which will then be stored in the database for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program uses the computers webcam and KAIROS facial recognition API to train the dataset in the KAIROS database to recognise various faces. It then runs ML algorithms using the KAIROS API to detect similarities in 
between different photos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to debug the facial recognition API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge to implement django, rest API, and KAIROS API all in one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty training the dataset originally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an app that can help reduce a big problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to teach ourselves various different frameworks and technologies over a short period of time, to be able to make this project work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Rest API, JSON , Kairos facial recognition API , mySQL Database. And learned debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Locate.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use of the Facebook Graph API to increase the possible scope of the ML training as well as the overall usefulness of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use of the Twilio SMS API to send reports and updates over SMS to users of the app.
