                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a group are part of a fraternity in which one of are pillars is community service. We want to make an app that would help give back to the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a platform for those who engage in community service in terms of giving and receiving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first planned to use sql and php to host the server, but we were introduced to firebase which made the back end much easier on us. It was a struggle, but firebase was there to make the project stand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to change between sql to firebase and to learn firebase. Also most of us in the group are new to android studio, so that was a learning curve also.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a product that is mostly functional that was made in a short span of time due to most of us learning most of the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use firebase as a backend. This is much different than sql as the database is very broad and non-tabular.
                </p>

                    What's next for Helping Hand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand to different platforms and maybe even attach facebook functionality to host events and post them.
