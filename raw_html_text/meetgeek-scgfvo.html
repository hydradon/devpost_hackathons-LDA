                    We all know that SeatGeek is growing - fast. We&rsquo;ve already hired 56 people this year, and are planning on hiring almost 100 more through the end of the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there&rsquo;s a challenge that lies ahead - as we grow in size, how do we scale our culture and maintain our small-firm, start-uppy feel? We&rsquo;ve heard the line &ldquo;I used to know everybody&rsquo;s names&rdquo; too many times already.

                    Enter: MeetGeek, a Facebook for SeatGeek employees. MeetGeek will serve as an internal network where people can see their colleagues interests, slack channels, SeatGeek extra curriculars, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MeetGeek will serve as a one stop shop for all things social at seatgeek
It will serve as both a peoples directory and a newsfeed
                </p>
                <p>
                    The homepage of meetgeek is surrounded around upcoming dates and fresh faces. It will serve as a consolidated hub for all SeatGeek extracurricular and social events. Some examples include Workation, Hackathons, SG class schedules, and birthdays.
Additionally, we will highlight new hires at the bottom of the homepage, giving you the chance to click on their bios to learn more about them&hellip;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    which leads us to our next page:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each employee will have their own personal page that goes beyond the scope of our SG bios (which are included at the bottom). These pages will be a fun opportunity to learn more about your coworkers and will make you feel less like a stranger. For example: for me you can find me outside the office still watching the Yodeling Boy Wallmart Video and playing soccer in the Bowery League
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a people&rsquo;s directory allows employees to easily search for people by department. Shout out (our fearless hackathon leader Ben Clark sitting on his iron throne)

                <p>
                    Our vision is not to organize a database that houses mundane information, but rather to create a place where SeatGeek employees, both new and tenured, can learn about their colleagues, make connections, and find common interests. We believe that MeetGeek has the opportunity to continue to unite our company as a singular family while we continue to grow our footprint in New York and across the globe.
