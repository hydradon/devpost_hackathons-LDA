                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When our parents cook me meals, whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, we always have to let the food cool down before eating or else we burn our tongue. Instead of wasting our time waiting or trying to blow the food with our mouth, why not let a fan do it for us and all we have to do is look at a camera. We don't have to put much effort in cooling our food anymore!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses face recognition to fan the person and their food. Food can be placed under the fan, on top of a food holder. Users can place the food in front of the fan and eat in front of the fan. This way, the fan will be able to cool two meals and a face at the same time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cardboard boxes were used to build the structure of the fan. Raspberry-pi was used to connect the hardware to the software and give commands to the motor. Two motors were used to rotate the cardboard piece, creating the fan. Using TensorFlow, we were able to recognize people walking in front of the camera.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    trying to use servos to rotate the cardboard

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    building the structure of the fan, making the fan spin, and being able to make a complete circuit.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't fry the raspberry-pi by placing the wires in the correct places! Servos are difficult to use. To pivot.
                </p>

                    What's next for Face to(o) Cool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    create a more powerful fan and record what users eat to help them keep track of calories and/or eat healthy.
