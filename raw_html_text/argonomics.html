                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who spend hours every day at our desk, we've noticed a significant disparity between the physical health of our programming friends versus our friends in other programs. Moreover, we've noticed that after a day of bad posture-induced pain, our mood is significantly worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, we've decided to produce an application that encourages people with a sedentary lifestyle to improve their every day life through a small, but rewarding change: improving your posture. By improving workstation ergonomics, we drastically cut the probabilities of developing health issues due to bad posture
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throw your measuring tape away! Our application uses AR to suggest the optimal desk and chair height for their work station.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using Unity, C#, and AR Core.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had two main challenges:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Understanding how AR works
This issue was fixed by a lot of hard work and a little bit of mentorship from the developers at Unity
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Calculating vertical distances
This issue was solved by reducing the scope of our product to horizontal planes such as the desk and the chair
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
