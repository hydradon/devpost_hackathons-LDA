                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to generate a way to make the information secure, portable, encrypted and able to be decrypted to the information back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does It can
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is used to generate a secure image with all the information encrypted in the each block of image by the text given by the user. All the information is stored in the image instead of server, so users can make sure their privacy can't be reached from internet, and users can get the information in the image only when the password is provided
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an encryption invented by ourselves, which use prime number product and inversion. We are not using any existing algorithm like Hash because it lost information so we can't get the things back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is how to get information back. Since we are going to use prime factorization, python can't support some really large number to do division, so it still has some error when try to decryption
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think this program has many advantages than those existing nowadays. It has many advantages, like the private file can be freely shared or published, but only those who know the password can access the information. And our mathematical part is really cool, we use the inversion of numbers to remember the original order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt how to implement our mathematical knowledge to programming, python language details, how to draw a picture with python and most important, how to work as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SecureImageConverter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think SecureImageConverter can be commercialized. In the future, it should support using phone camera to scan the printed out image. So it can be used as stickers or a booklet for the private information. For example, the patient profile can be a booklet of SecureImage, so doctors can scan it to see the information, but everyone else without the password can't see this private information
