                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Hummam's father got a parking ticket, he decided that he wouldn't let any Montrealer get a parking ticket ever again, and created an application to decode the cryptic signs on most Montreal streets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take a picture of any parking sign, and the application will tell you if you can park there, and for how long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile frontend is made with Flutter, and the Python backend runs on Google App Engine. The backend sends the image to Google Cloud Vision to be analyzed. The application also uses data to present fun facts about parking in the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get Firebase working (we gave up in the end)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Cloud Vision API working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the Google Cloud Vision API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for prkr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better accuracy and faster serverside optimization. Maybe in the future the machine can be implemented in the Montreal parking app.
                </p>
