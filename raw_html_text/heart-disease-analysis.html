                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for something that could have societal impacts and after searching through a couple of dataset databases, this one stuck out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes four datasets downloaded from
                    <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease" rel="nofollow">
                        here
                    </a>
                    containing patient information and tries to find relationships with heart diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built two versions, one with a neural network, and one with KNN clustering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dataset had a lot of missing values so we had to come up with ways to make sure our data could still be analyzed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to have a functioning system that has a pretty good confidence/accuracy was the best moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about how to implement machine learning and how to deal with messy data..
