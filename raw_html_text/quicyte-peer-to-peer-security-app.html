                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the power to instantaneously destroy fundamental infrastructure that propels the growth and serenity of our world today, software has become the utmost facet of importance in every corner piece of society. Everywhere you turn, you hear of governments getting hacked, major corporations losing data worth billions, and the everyday citizen losing their most prized information. There currently exist many security solutions, such as auditing firms or software apps such as norton, but none truly address the increasingly crucial aspect of security today, wireless protection. The seething danger of wireless malware is unprecedented, with hackers being able to take complete control of your phone by just being near you. A target that spans 20+ billion wireless and bluetooth devices today. 40% of those devices are estimated to be in danger due to being unpatchable, a level that could prove to be catastrophic to anyone, anywhere. This was seen by blueborne, a bluetooth peer to peer wireless over the air attack that affected 8 Billion devices.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quicyte is an cross platform app that protects you from any type of wireless over the air attack. We detect when you are getting attacked, and protect you by shutting down your wifi and bluetooth. This scales to anyone in your area that is also vulnerable to be attacked, and we protect too. Using heuristics and machine learning, our protection only gets better with time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile applications (android and ios) in Flutter, AWS and Azure for backend, Google Cloud for machine learning, and the Wolfram Alpha api for location information.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was getting training data for the machine learning.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the technical feats that we accomplished within 36 hours, but even more so we believe we are solving a very real problem that will protect billions of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project workflow was extremely important to our success, and something we learned greatly from. Initially, we wanted to implement agile teams with asana, but we found that to be too much for a 36 hour timeline. We found the whiteboard to extremely beneficial, as it allowed us to rapidly prototype without wasting time. As the 36 hours progressed, everything started to fall together, and we found that our advance planning helped a lot, but we still have many areas in which we can improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quicyte: peer to peer security app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our expansion plan mainly focuses on targeting a B2B Saas model, where we think has the most direct application as of now other than regular consumer users. We would implement our software and hardware in banks, hospitals, and other high stake institutions.
