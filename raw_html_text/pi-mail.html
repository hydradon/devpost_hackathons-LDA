                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to create an innovative easy way to know if we have mail or if someone has tried to look at our mail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Pi-Mail takes pictures from the inside of the mailbox when then door is opened while posting the pictures to a website and giving Alexa the skill to update you on the last time you received mail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry pi, a pi camera, and python to take pictures when the pixels detected a certain amount of change. We then set up an email to send the picture to the user with python. We also used amazon web services to set up a webpage that receives images from the pi and posts them to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our motion sensor would not work, so we had to think of a different way of detecting motion and after research found that we could use change in pixels from the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we completed everything we set out to do for pi-mail.  From making our sensors work, to creating a dynamic webpages and to creating an Alexa Skill with our project are some of the many accomplishments we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating pi-mail has taught us a lot!  Many of the features we implemented into pi-mail were very new to us.  Our team has never used Amazon Web Services (AWS) so sending images, pages and an RSS feed to S3 was very new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pi-Mail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future implementations include solar power capabilities, resizable frames that can be inserted into any mailbox, video formats, live previews and a mobile application.
