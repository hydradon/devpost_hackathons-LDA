                    Motivation

                <p>
                    As passionate followers of some of the top MLG pros in the industry, we came to a mutual understanding that the incoherent floods of scrambled replies to a Streamer's solicitation of information to their viewers can be overwhelming, and there needs to be a solution.
Purpose
Automated Live Polling Solution of the Future!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dynopoll.io exists to serve as a solution to the problems that arise from live polling, whether it be Twitch, YouTube, IRC, etc. Our team of engineers and quality control specialists specially crafted this product to be as least intrusive to the viewers, and most intuitive to the streamer as possible.
How is this Useful?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In popular chat rooms, such as busy Twitch's Fortnite Streams, a streamer may want input from the fans as to which song they should play while they own some n00bs, or which even something as simple as whether they should order pizza or chinese. These streamers have vast amount of followers, all eager to give their input. This may not be so bad if it is a binary question, but when there are many choices, the streamer will be flooded with replies faster than they can think. This will result in the streamer potentially making the less than optimal choice that will satisfy the most fans. Using our algorithm, we have the viewers take a poll and calculate the most desired choice. The streamer can gather this data and make the right decision. The fans will be happier, which then translates to more views in the future, which is the most important metric when determining revenue on these type of platforms.
Implementation
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dynopoll.io will is hosted at Dynopoll.io . Here, users will login select their platform, and create a simple poll for their users. Dynopoll.io then counts the polls and calculates the winner and returns statistics as well as other data analytics to the user, all of which is invisible to the viewers making Dynopoll.io as discrete and least intrusive as possible. Dynopoll.io is still in its early stages and has room for improvement. As of 30 September 2018, Dynopoll.io has only been implemented and tested, with great results on Twitch.tv. With funding and more development, we plan to expand to other popular platforms such as YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
Target Audience
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although everyone can benefit from Dynopoll.io, our team of Mathematicians and Analysts have determined that users that draw in a viewcount of over 5,500 per stream/session see the most change.
