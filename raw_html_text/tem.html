                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people in the gym nowadays use improper form when performing exercises, and as a result they end up injuring themselves or even others. By utilizing our hack and achieving proper form, people can prevent these injuries and build muscle more efficiently, as proper form ensures precise muscle targeting. Proper breathing techniques are also very important while working out and with our hack, the user will be able to benefit from being able to breathe at the appropriate times.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the use of flex sensors, which measure the degree of tilt, we were able to create a device which notifies the user if they are using improper form when performing certain exercises like the bench press and barbell curls. If the user bends their wrist, elbow, or shoulder the wrong way, an alarming sound is emitted so that the user knows to correct themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using the Arduino platform, which allows for the development of small digital and interactive devices. We started off by building the circuitry required to power and calibrate the flex sensors and buzzers, by connecting male and female wires as well as resistors into the correct spots on the breadboard.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When constructing the device, we realized we didn't have access to all the materials we would need to finish. We needed more male and female wires as well as smaller flex sensors. It was also a big challenge to calibrate the flex sensors so that they notify the user at the correct positions, as this required a great deal of testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting the final product done even though we had a lack of resources. It was very tough to get the buzzer to sound at the right times, however, we got it to work the way we wanted.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course of this hackathon, we learned different ways to wire for the circuity and how to adjust the flex sensors so we get more accurate readings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FormFix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In continuation of this project, we hope to incorporate this device into a glove or a long sleeve T-shirt, so someone can go to the gym with it on, and be able to know when they are using improper form. We also hope to develop an app so the user can time their workouts and see exactly why they are being notified by the device.
