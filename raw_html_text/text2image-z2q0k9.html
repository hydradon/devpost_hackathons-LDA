                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a project that contributes to society and help those who are in need of assistance. We decided to help those who have trouble reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text2Image changes the keywords from a body of text into images, to give a better understanding to those who have difficulty reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Indico Text Analysis API in Python in order to pull out the keywords in the text. We then used Flask and JavaScript to develop the webpage that allows the user to past in his text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally had no experience in using Flask in order to make webpages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully managed to incorporate JavaScript with Python in order to get the webpage working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask as a framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text2Image
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on turning Text2Image into a Chrome extension to make the app more accessible and user friendly.
