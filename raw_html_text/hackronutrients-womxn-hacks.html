                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We co-created a website in which users can calculate the appropriate amount of each macronutrient needed for their unique diet! We have an interest in mental and physical well-being, which we believe begins with the food we put in our bodies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to tabulate daily macronutrients in order to optimize their diet in order to live their best life. It also contains links to ideas and recipes to help the user to assist with lifestyle changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to code and GitHub to facilitate communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us knew how to use HTML or GitHub so learning while creating was difficult.
                </p>

                    HTML and GitHub
