                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Inspiration came from our desire of creating an e-commerce platform from which people can buy items, enhance their ability of taking risks and maybe have some fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform is based on an auction system. There are a number of 5 to 10 auctions a day during which Buckets of goods are bought. Out of a bucket you have details(description and photo) of only three of these the rest of them are unknow items or maybe the BIG DEAL! The Big Deal is announced in the morning but no one knows in which of the buckets it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we run into was to estamblish the paypal payment system. Another problem was to think about a system that is not too risky and makes people want to bid even if there is a chance of losing money. This is why our current version is not the one that we started with.With out current version even if people lose money they always get something out of their trade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to create a easy to use platform with a straight forward design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what is the main process of developing a paypal payment system, how to estamblish a layershift server, how to work on git different branches without affecting the master branch, what bloomberg is and how to play warewolf.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TradeIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking of going further with the development, build dynamic auction rooms, implement esential features, think about who could provide the goods that are used (external vendors or find finances to buy our own goods).
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S.: Our application is using the LayerShift and Brain-Tree services.
