                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to cut down energy usage during the peak power time to both save overall energy, therefore limiting reserve power plants from being used as well as save customers money by conserving energy, especially during peak hours.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors the ways to reduce energy consumption in the home during peak hours and allows you to choose areas to save energy
