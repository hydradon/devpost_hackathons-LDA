                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing all of the amazing women in tech who fought hard to get where they are now, it made me almost disappointed that nobody ever knew of what we had to face to get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple, informative website which opens people's minds to the outright bias in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a template, I reconfigured the website with my own code (mostly html and some css) and made it an easy to understand interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the previous code that was there became useless, so I had to scrap it all and start the "Advice" page from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is also my first hackathon, so I am proud that I was able to finish my project and submit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to not take the easy way out and take time to be picky because that's what makes the website yours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Problems, Prejudice, and Partiality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this hackathon, I hope to proceed to update the website every time I come  across a new struggle that women face in tech.
                </p>
