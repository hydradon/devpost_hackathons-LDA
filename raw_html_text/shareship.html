                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of paying exorbitant shipping prices for products with a marginal value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aggregates a list of people ordering from a particular retailer; thus others can place an order with you and save out on the cost of shipping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built on Ruby-on-Rails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the Chrome Extension, and populating the database with test data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished on time, and the team learned how to use Rails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team had never used Rails before, so it was a great learning experience as all of us got exposed to Rails for the first time.
                </p>
