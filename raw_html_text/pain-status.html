                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Give the NY presbyterian patients a way to communicate with others and Nurses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app is very basic and only has the ability to select a pain level
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase as our back-end and javascript. Some bootstrap so we did not have to worry about much design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a language I am not familiar with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was able to get a feature done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use a language that I know well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pain Status
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to make a web app that provided chat, games, and pain notifier. If we were to improve it, it would have many features patient could use to be entertained, talk to others, and a way for nurses to better know what is going on based on what the patient tell them in a centralized location.
