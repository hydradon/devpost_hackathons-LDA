                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know the importance of updates, yet our systems aren't always up to date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's why the idea for an information campaign was born, which is intended to encourage sysadmins to update and patch their systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A website for the campaign is made, which contains arguments for patching, and examples of what happens if systems aren't patched.
