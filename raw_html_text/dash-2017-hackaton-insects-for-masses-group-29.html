                    i. Project name: Strange Things Inside  #doesntbugme
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. One sentence describing your project: Changing people's negative perception of eating insects by triggering curiosity and encouraging exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. The technology behind the project: Keeping it simple by including our product to existing web-based platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iv. Team members: Teodor Georgiev, Milla Alaraatikka, Jasmina Aleksic, Marta Adamska, Sonja Nielsen
                </p>
                <p>
                    v. Inspiration:  How did we lose the desire to explore food through adulthood? How do we get back in touch with our childlike curiosity?  We want to address the community of adventurous food lovers as well as enhance the &ldquo;why not&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;why should I&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does: Or product triggers the customer's curiosity and encourages exploration in sustainable food resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it: We envision our product as being a part of everyday life. It was created with the idea of sharing and enjoying exploring more sustainable food resources with others. By building an authentic and transparent web page about the products that we consume.
Instagram &amp; Web 
Various social media channels became an essential part of our online marketing strategy. Through the web and Instagram, we communicate, connect and update the community.  Which would give a great opportunity for the product to expand in the community of adventurous food lovers. The material chosen for the packaging is carton made from natural brown unbleached paperboard that retains the color of the wood fibers and has a visible fiber structure and it's also 100% recyclable.

                    Challenge faced: How do we eliminate the fear of insect-based food and help people overcome their barrier of the YUCK?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quotes gathered from conducting research, which led us to the insights of: 
People being aware of the nutritious values of insect-based foods, but yet struggling to overcome their barrier of the visual disgust
The visual appearance of the insects affects people negatively however by disguising the food more are willing to try it!
People are open to exploring new foods and combining with their existing food lifestyle, but the lack of knowledge about the insect food is discouraging to take the next step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I know that insects are very nutritious that&rsquo;s why I wouldn&rsquo;t mind eating them,  but only if they were disguised, so I don&rsquo;t have to see the whole insect in the food.&rdquo; - Hector 23
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;When I was 11 years old my father bought flavored crickets and I tried it. Now I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to try them because I would get disgusted by seeing the whole insect. - Julia 18
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Well if I knew that a dish contains insects, I would probably not want to eat it... maybe I would consider trying it as a powder. I don&rsquo;t need to know that it is actually insects&rdquo; - Barbara 23
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have learned that people are aware of the health benefits and how the food production is affecting the climate change but still not ready to take the step towards eating sustainable protein sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step for our project is to launch a web page and social media platform to start marketing the community of strange things inside  #doesntbugme. So that more people can get involved in the food revolution and start sharing their experiences by becoming ambassadors for the new sustainable insect food community.
