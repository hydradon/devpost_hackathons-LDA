                </h2>
                <p>
                    KokoRawr at its core is a Slack App that facilitates new types of interactions via chaotic cooperative gaming through text. Every user is placed on a team based on their Slack username and tries to increase their team's score by playing games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Battleship, and Rock Paper Scissors. Teams must work together to play. However, a "Twitch Plays Pokemon" sort of environment can easily be created where multiple people are trying to execute commands at the same time and step on each others' toes. Additionally, people can visualize the games via a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We jumped off the deep into the land of microservices. We made liberal use of StdLib with node.js to deploy a service for every feature in the app, amounting to 10 different services. The StdLib services all talk to each other and to Slack. We also have a visualization of the game boards that is hosted as a Flask server on Heroku that talks to the microservices to get information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to add more games to play and expand the variety of visualizations that are shown to include more games. Some service restructuring would be need to be done to reduce the Slack latency. Also, game state would need to be more persistent for the services.
