                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2016 alone, the opioid epidemic has taken more than 64,000 American lives from overdoses. This major crisis is on a rise due to the use of prescription and non-prescription opioid drugs in the United States and Canada. What makes opioids a dangerous substance is due to the fact that it can affect anyone at anytime. It can affect your friends, your co-workers, and even your loved ones. Teenagers between the ages of 12 and 18 have been identified as extremely vulnerable to opioid abuse and we need to find ways to educate them. Others have already made the mistake of misusing opioids, but our children don't have to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application is created to prevent people, particularly teenagers, from abusing opioids, by providing testimonies, local resources (based on location) to call, and a list of events around your local area with Google Maps integrated, where you can attend meetups to find help or to just learn and understand the danger of opioid abuse. At any time, we also encourage our users to take the pledge to fight against the opioid crisis and to share these resources with their friends and families by posting to Facebook. This feature can be expanded to other social media apps like Twitter and Instagram. Be committed to your community, be committed to your friends and families, and be committed to yourself! Take the pledge!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this Android application in Android Studio using Java. A bulk of the information was scraped from
                    <a href="http://www.outthemonster.com" rel="nofollow">
                        OuttheMonster
                    </a>
                    . The information for providing phone numbers and websites of different local resources was obtained from
                    <a href="http://www.drugfreegreaterlowell.org" rel="nofollow">
                        DrugFreeGreaterLowell
                    </a>
                    and parsed as JSON info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to find a way to provide useful information that was effective in reaching out to teenagers and making a social aspect that furthered our ability to prevent teenagers from using opioids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we created an informational application that helps teenagers avoid opioids with a social aspect involved. The app has a lot of content to explore and interact with to educate teenagers about opioids and provide them with ways to find help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opioid abuse can happen to anybody at any time. Preventing opioid abuse is not something that technology alone can solve. It requires the help of friends and family to create an impact by being active about the cause and utilizing an app like this to create a social media footprint. It is up to the people to make an app like this revolutionary.
                </p>

                    What's next for Opavoid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more social media links like Twitter and Instagram in addition to Facebook for pledging to not abusing opioids. Additional useful resources can populate the app and a chat system can be implemented to interact directly with online counselors. We already registered
                    <a href="http://opavoid.com" rel="nofollow">
                        opavoid.com
                    </a>
                    on Domain.com to market the application and provide our message and goals to teenagers. Currently, it redirects to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's page for opioid overdose prevention as our way of promoting the prevention of opioid overdose. The app can later be expanded to an iOS and web page version.
