                <p>
                    Here's how it works! In this prototype, user can enter an Amazon URL and the bot will save that data. Once a data, the backend will run a script and see if the price has lowered. If it has, the bot sends a message to the user about it!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Facebook's Messenger API with webhooks to get data like the inputted URL and to index user IDs. We then put this data in database in Google's Firebase. A Python script in the backend would read this data, scrap through it, and make changes. If any desired change is seen, front-end will rev up and show the user the difference in price observed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran in a lot of challenges, the most with deployment on heroku, since we had to deploy the whole front-end script to heroku to test it. Another big challenge was getting our backend script to parse data in any kind of page of Amazon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Messenger Price Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to use this app for not only Amazon but any other retail website you would like to keep a price check on.
