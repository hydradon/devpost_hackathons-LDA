                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend was using wolfram to control an arduino and I wanted to control my Basys3 FPGA but couldn't find any examples online so I made my own code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It outputs the dev board switch statuses to serial and wolfram reads those values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found a Serial out module for the FPGA and adapted it to send the switch values. Then I wrote a very small amount of code on the wolfram desktop app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was that my laptop crashed so I had to develop this entirely using my surface touch screen keyboard. The biggest technical challenge was the implementation of serial on an FPGA.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It actually works despite!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more VHDL!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for wolfram FPGA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally I will write a more complex library for the two to communicate with allowing FPGA users to use wolfram on their projects.
