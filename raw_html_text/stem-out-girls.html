                    We all met at FemmeHacks 2018, bonded by our interest in hacking (and doughnuts!). We are all beginners and learned A LOT from the experience.

                    Although the event was a lot of fun, we all knew that there could have been so many more people participating. Thus, we were inspired to begin spreading awareness not only about hacking, but to all females of STEM. Especially young women who miss opportunities because of lack of encouragement, interest, and communication, as well as the unfortunate stigma surrounding females in STEM.

                    Our goal is to connect and inform females interested in pursuing STEM, of all ages and abilities.

                    We enjoyed this hackathon so much and are very proud of what we learned and the work we have accomplished!
