                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a climate change conscious team, we wanted to build a solution to reducing carbon footprint while traveling. Precisely, targeting alternative means of transport to planes - the biggest issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Global air travel has been responsible for 918 million tonnes of CO2 last year. And 2019 is setting a new record expecting 4.6 billions passengers between 45 millions flights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just before the hackathon, we took a flight from Barcelona to Berlin to attend the event. 2 hours and 40 mins of flight + 2 hours of airport transfer commute got us thinking: &ldquo;How much CO2 did we generate?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What would have been the alternative route?&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ecotrip is a platform that offers a solution to planes&rsquo; large CO2 emission by showing routes from user&rsquo;s origin point to their desired destination, suggesting alternative means of transport ordered by their level of sustainability.
