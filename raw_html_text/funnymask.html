                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have time to get far but Noah wanted to make a game based off this premise:
    In 20&Ocirc;&Oslash;, in the Union province of the United States of Pangea, Funny_Mask takes a call from behind a trashcan in the dead of night. Everything Corp. resides on the other end, whispering into Funny_Mask&rsquo;s ear. Everything Corp., one of only two firms in the Global Economy, demands a debt be paid. Funny_Mask is tasked to infiltrate Standard General, the only competition of Everything Corp.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stealth game with a player that can teleport using computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planned on making 3d models with Blender and creating the game in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have very little experience with making a game and it we were too tired and time-constraint to get it to actually function. We also came across technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea, the character designs, and the audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not to bite off more than we could chew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FunnyMask
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably nothing.
