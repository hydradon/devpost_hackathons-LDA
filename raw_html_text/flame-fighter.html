                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop a robot that could help firemen survey a room or building and record the different temperatures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flame Fighter records the temperature at different areas of a confined space and at the end of surveying it goes to the the point with the highest temperature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino tank bot and attached sensors to it to record the temperatures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the different algorithms to record temperatures at specific points of the room. Also to create code to combine all of the senors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to use the ultrasonic sensor to record its position in the room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We acquired intuition on how to begin a prototype and how to carry it out until the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flame Fighter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing it to adapt to rooms that don't resemble a polygon.
