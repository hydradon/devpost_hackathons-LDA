                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've worked a lot in France. I've witnessed many requirements being written. On major contracts (government or contract-based), what they need is to capture requirements in Confluence, and reference them in JIRA. Because requirements are text, they're static, while issues represent changes and development tasks. So, that's what I've done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "Yogi" comes from the simplicity of the product, which is supposed to make you a master of the requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Integration in JIRA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I've created Requirement Yogi last year, the new part is the JIRA integration. Let's begin from the start. You can type requirements in Confluence, usually in a table (ICAR tables). You can set requirement keys (such as REQ-001) using Requirement Yogi. When you view the page, you can hover over the requirement key and you get links to places where the requirement is referenced. This is very useful when the requirements about a webpage reference requirements about the business logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From JIRA, it is possible to create links to Confluence requirements. There's a search feature: Requirement Yogi details the headline of the requirement, you can lookup by keyword or by key. When clicking the link, you reach the page in Confluence, scrolled at the right place. It's a very simple plugin, yet I find it surprisingly beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    For whom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as there's a formalized software process, functional analysts, tech writers, testers and/or UI designers will start drafting screens, workflows and listing requirements. It will enable testers to have clear lists of items to be tested, and when raising bugs in JIRA they can add the link and quote of the original requirement. It also accelerates the work of the developer who can find the original document to put the requirement in context.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very simple JIRA-and-Confluence tool. It is for the server-only versions of the products. The most important part was UI testing with customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The JIRA API was new to me and I wanted to make communications secure and authenticated. Applinks (it's an Atlassian module which connects JIRA and Confluence) was a piece of cake compared to Active Objects (the ORM). In the end I'm very satisfied with the apparent simplicity of the plugin. Everyone seems to find it easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Military customers! and government branches. I don't know whether I should be proud of that, but it shows that there's a lot of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There must be a lot of requirement writing in military.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Requirement Yogi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few ideas. We could manage requirement versions and baselines. Testing sessions are another idea. Raising an issue by clicking a requirement in Confluence would be great. Amazon invented the 1-click-purchase, we could make a 1-click-testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in any case: I'll keep it simple!
