                <p>
                    I was inspired by Louis Guthmann at EthCC who said that even the biggest Zero-knowledge companies do not use GPU's to accelerate their Proofs. I thought that we can easily change that by executing the slowest (and highly parallelizable) on a graphics card.

                    GPU-Snark executes the Fast Fourier Transformation on Finite Elements for Snarks.
It is several times faster than the existing CPU implementation Libsnark (used by ZCash).
It is fully templated, so it can calculate different datatypes. 
The Interface matches the interface of

                    The implementation is in CUDA so it can only run on NVIDIA Graphics Cards.

                <p>
                    I've started Friday evening and build the first version without compiling it since I do not have a Nvidia GPU in my Laptop. I tried to set up a AWS Student account to test it in the cloud but Amazon was a bit slow.
In the end I got access to a university server to test and benchmark GPU-Snark.

                <p>
                    Next Steps for GPU_Snarks are cleanup of the code, with more time I can probably make it even more efficient, Proper integration into [Libsnark] and

Porting the code to OpenCL.
Proper Open Source Licensing. 
Looking for other parts in Snarks that can be executed in a highly parallel fashion.
