                </h2>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Html, css, and javascript was used for the frontend. Python and jquery were used for the backend.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customizing a customer's travel experience requires a lot of information and API's.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to continue to expand on the options that users can explore for what's going on in the cities they are departing from and arriving to such as languages and time zones.
