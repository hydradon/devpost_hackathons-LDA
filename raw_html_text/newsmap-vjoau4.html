                    Main issue is leaving it up to the user to decide where are the most important areas of interest.
Day-by-day, these areas of interest can change.
With our program, instead of having to constantly be updating or calculating where is most important, the user can hover their mouse over a region of the map and be given the headline that&rsquo;s originating from there.
This is beneficial compared to conventional news sources because the user will see a cluster of relevant stories in one spot if something noteworthy happened in that location.
Now it&rsquo;s up to the user if he wants to completely ignore the cluster in Canada and instead focus on the lesser clusters in North Korea.
Over time this data may be instrumental in determining useful information about a country, if not simply how vocal their media is.
