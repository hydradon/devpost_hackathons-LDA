                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The use of IT has grown to such an unprecedented stage that it is now possible to do much more than was possible heretofore. It is considered equally important to seek adequate weather condition for planting as it is to utilize the right seedlings. This work is inspired by the vast possibilities that can be achieved with IT and aims at developing a system which monitors, and guides a farmer before, during and after planting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors the weather condition automatically and sends proactive instructions to the farmer in regards to the specific plants on the farm i.e. a given location. Some of the weather conditions being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed. Soil PH and water content level are also monitored to ensure an enabling environment for plants production. In the case of animal production, PH level of the aquaculture is monitored for fish production.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application is a java desktop application with a robust database containing data-set of climate weather condition for crops and animals. The integration of the desktop application and the hardware part is also carried out. Hardware section consists of a micro-controller and sensors. Assembly language is also used for the micro-controller programming.

                    Challenges in development
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that will be encountered in developing the system is that of the finance for the procurement of the relevant sensors.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we are able to come up with a partially working system which when given time to revamp the software will be full working application and ready for implementation
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are able to learn the advantage of teamwork and the synergy it aids us to come up with this wonderful idea
