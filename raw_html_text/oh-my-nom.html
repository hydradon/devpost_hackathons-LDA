                    A quicker way of finding some inspiration on what to cook or eat.
Our website gives the user a random recipe with an ingredient list and
gives a link to the full recipe page. The user is able to filter the
recipes based on dietary restrictions, and generate random recipes
with a click of a button.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Meteor js.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first it was challenging to come with an idea. It was difficult
finding a free recipe API, especially one that included the items we
needed.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we came up with this idea that even we would want to
use and that it is somewhat functioning since we did start a lot later
than when the hackathon began.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Meteor and how to use it to make a website. We also
learned CSS and HTML, as well as client and server interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oh, My Nom!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is so much we think that Oh, My Nom could do. For the website,
we want to add allergy filters to not include the foods the user is
allergic to. We want to add more dietary restrictions to the filters.
Along with recipes, we want to include going out to eat. We would need
a restaurant menu database to filter the foods based on allergies and
restrictions. The user would be able to choose to eat out or eat in.
Along with getting random recipes with a click of a button, we want
the user to be able to create an account and save their preferences as
well as save recipes. Oh, My Nom would also be an app. The app would
start with a login, then preferences for allergies and dietary
restrictions, then recipes show up as an image with prep and cook
time. The user can swipe left to get a new recipe or swipe right to
save it for later. Clicking on the image allows the user to look at
the full recipe page.
