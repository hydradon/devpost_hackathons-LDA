                    is a Slack bot we use in a large Slack group chat. It can compose haikus, play games, and generate images with a single command. However, until now, it hasn't had a presence in real life!

                <p>
                    The panic eggplant is Botty's real-world avatar. With two wacky waving arms and a fresh eggplant from the grocery store, it's capable of many different functions, all of which involve flailing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used one of the TerribleHack robot kits, a lot of cardboard, and a few 9g RC servos. On the PC side, a Python bridge connects Botty to the Panic Eggplant using PyBlueZ.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the servos burnt out after I tied both power lines to ground and the signal line high. Luckily, we had a replacement on hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting the bluetooth stack set up took a while, as did actually making things connect. There's like no documentation for this it seems.
                </p>

                    Panic Eggplant will soon be moving to New York to start its independent music career. Subscribe to their twitter for tour announcements, flailing GIFs, and more.
