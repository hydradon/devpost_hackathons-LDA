                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a research carried out by the US, most of the car damages happen while reversing a car in the parking lot. Like this, people lose million of dollars, which is not a good news at all!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we made a project that indicates how close we are to an object while reversing a car or equivalent via different LED bulbs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Arduino and C programming via Arduino Uno, LEDs and an ultrasonic sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges we ran into included organizing all the elements and controlling the anomolous behavior of LEDs at various times.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to make a system which can be of use for the society
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enhanced our knowledge on Arduino and C due to our extensive research. Moreover, we enhanced our circuit and code debugging skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ultrasonic Parking Aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make it larger by increasing the number of ultrasonic sensors in order to enhance it's accuracy. We can also add it in different directions in order to enhance data collection and processing.
