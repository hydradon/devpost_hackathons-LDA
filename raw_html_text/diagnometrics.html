                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has numerous family members suffering from mental illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Dementia, however an ongoing struggle for us was allowing them independence while simultaneously monitoring their mental state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By creating this project, it allows us to monitor their well-being for ease of mind as well as providing useful data to provide to care givers such as physicians.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using medically recognized test criteria, we obtain answers from the patient and store them in a database for easy viewing for caregivers, family members, physicians, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the Google Home side, we used Dialogflow, Google Actions, Node.js
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build the Android app, we learnt JSON querying and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time developing any applications on these platforms, so we spent a lot of time learning how they work on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to get a working demo completed on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Diagnometrics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diagnometrics can be expanded by adding more data analysis. We could add machine learning to parse the input and determine the state of a patient.
