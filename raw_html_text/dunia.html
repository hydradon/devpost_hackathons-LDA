                    What is Dunia?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After experiencing amazing adventures throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas our team wanted to share the stunning places we lived in with others. Current mapping platforms don't provide any collaboration or goal-achievement support, so we set out to build our own application. Dunia gives users the chance to connect over the adventures they have experienced and the ones they are about to embark on by enabling them to share their favourite travel locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dunia runs on the Firebase Realtime Database so every user sees instantaneous updates when new adventures pop-up around the world. We built an interaction layer on top of the Google Maps API with Firebase so we could create and store locations around the world where people are interested in adventure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so excited by the way that adventures can be shared with friends at the
                    <strong>
                        exact same moment
                    </strong>
                    that the location is recorded by original poster. The speed and ability to share places makes this a web application we will continue to use in the future. It was often challenging to make sure that data structures were appropriate and functions were called in the right order so that the asynchronous nature of the application was maintained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dunia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it into the hands of our friends who can get the benefit out of it that we are already experiencing.
