                    CodeCrowd is an email notification software to help pair programmers with open-source repositories that meet their skill-level and interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By signing up with their email, individuals can choose their proficient languages, decide their technical topics of interest, tell their overall experience with open-source software, and choose the size of team they like to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of these factors are taken into consideration to introduce software developers to repositories that perfectly match their interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each week, an automated email is sent to the user with a list of 5 of the best-matching repositories that we believe the user will most enjoy working on.

                    CodeCrowd is implemented in .NET Core version 2.2. The user interface is written with an HTML/CSS/ReactJS stack before AJAX calls are sent back and forth between the C# back-end to transfer data. Information from Github is obtained with the Github API found at

                <p>
                    CodeCrowd is not intended to be a one-time message sent, but is meant to be consistently used to introduce developers to new and trending open-source repositories that can change as a developer's interests and skills change. In order to do this, user data, including their email, password, and preferences are saved in a MySQL database to be sent week after week. Emails are built through the MailMessage class and sent via an SmtpClient.
