                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore is such a vibrant society, with so many events going on around them it is a shame that the people often end up missing many events they might have wished to be a part of. We, therefore, identified this issue and took up this challenge to create an
                    <strong>
                        open-public platform
                    </strong>
                    for our audience to help them stay connected and informed about their surrounding on-going activities at all times.

                <p>
                    Our application allows its users to find events, such as parties, competitions and concert, and with the use of a personalized account, the application will be able to make smart choices on its own for an efficient and personalized experience for the users. When you open the application the app will give the user a prompt to switch to his/her location. Using Google Maps and our database of events which will be updated every hour (or major event update) we can recommend the user places which may interest the user, we will also offer services to buy/ reserve tickets for the user; this form of payment will be our key Income.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since all the members of our team have no programming knowledge/experience of any sort, it was difficult for us to figure out a way through which we could develop the software we imagined of having. Soon we came across a Third-Party App Development Software which helped us simplify the process.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    hAPPening has a far and steep future which we plan to accomplish by incorporating many new features such as, Personalized Events which will analyze previously chosen events, providing a street view along with the current crowd level of the event they may be interested in, providing the option to buy tickets to the event (if it is a premium event) through the application rather than making the user search for it online).
