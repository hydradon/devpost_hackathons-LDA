                    Everyday people are victims of crime. Whether you are suspicious of activity in your area or your life is being threatened, the most important factor in resolving the issue is efficient assistance from authorities. 
This is what SafeZone allows users to get. At the click of a button on your mobile device, support such as police, ambulance, or fire will be alerted of your need for assistance immediately. A simple to use application with built in features such as alerts, maps to show recent activity in your vicinity, and contact with support, will enable victims reach out for help at crucial times of need.

                    Some challenges we ran into as a team were thinking about how this app will solve our problem of making emergency contact for help more efficient, without making it more complicated for police, paramedics, and fire departments.

                    SafeZone has an array of applications. Not only is it scalable to large markets such as college campuses or neighborhoods, but we can go so far as to implement this within an impoverished community with a lack of communication tools and a proper system laws.
