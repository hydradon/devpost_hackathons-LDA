                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I trade stocks. When I see the earnings report date of a company I'm interested in, usually I'm already too late. So, I wanted to build a tool that can gather several companies' earnings report dates in a simplified fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The python program takes an input of a list of tickers and goes onto nasdaq.com and parses through its HTML and retrieves the relevant data of the expected earnings report dates and the EPS consensus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made the Python program using PyCharm. I made the website using a bootrap template and added some other HTML elements for my usage case
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing Python with HTML/CSS. Didn't have enough time to get a python framework set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Python program works and is actually useful to me because it provides a type of service that may have been not as optimal and/or costs money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a bit about data scraping.

                <p>
                    Get a website fully set up and be fully integrated with the Python program.
