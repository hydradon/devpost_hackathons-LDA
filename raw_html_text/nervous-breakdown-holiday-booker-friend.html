                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a friend who saves money for extended periods of time. When she has a substantial amount she packs her bags and goes to the airport and asks where there are cheap flights to. I got really stressed at the 20 hour mark of this hackathon and wished I could book a holiday. I couldn't be bothered to go through the long process of booking a flight and checking if I could afford it. I decided to create a text messaging service that will suggest a flight to you. Hopefully I would be able to link it to a banking api to allow it to pay for it completely.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It helps you find flights to go on holiday and can book them for you.
