                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many underclassmen on meal plan cannot finish their swipes by the end of the year, while upperclassmen off-meal plan cannot afford to eat off campus or have time to cook. Swipe Me In incentivizes people to donate and buy swipes by donating the money from each transaction to Second Harvest FoodBank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can register to be a Feeder (giving swipes) or Eater (buying swipes). Each meal by default costs $5, which the Eater will pay for by depositing money into their account. To begin, the Feeder shares a meal onto our platform, specifying their location and time duration. Then, an Eater will claim the meal. After they meet up outside the dining place, the Feeder will swipe the Eater in and confirm the meal swipe on their account. This triggers a payment confirmation on the Eater&rsquo;s account, deducting and donating $5 to the charity food bank.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Swipe Me In consists of two parts. First, we built the front-end with Bootstrap and optimized it for mobile use. Then, we wrote an App class with Python that has functions that are called in the HTML file.

                        Integrating the Stripe API was difficult for financial transactions, so the final implementation does not have a fully developed deposit/payment functions.
