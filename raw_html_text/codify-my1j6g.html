                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning programming in a classroom isn't as interactive as it should or can be. We go to class and listen to a lecture rather than actually interacting with the code itself. And when we do interact with the code, there is a limited amount of collaboration. The inspiration for this project stemmed from our desire to learn and our need for fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenge when it came to the backend. Without any knowledge in databases, we struggled building and using our database as well as handling all of the information that the user enters in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our user interface was pretty much done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little bit about Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for codify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be continuing this project with the goal of overcoming all of our challenges and then some.
