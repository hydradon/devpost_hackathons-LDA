                    Initially out of self-interest, we undertook teaching elementary school children programming for extra credit. It was both a fun and cumbersome experience. However, as we got more and more involved, we wanted to teach more for the sake of teaching than our increased grade. Sadly, we struggled with teaching the myriad syntaxes of programming in even the most rudimentary languages. Driven to change the status quo of our initiative, we decided to make a software where the students would only have to speak their mind -- what they wanted their code to do in simple English. Our objective was to teach them the concepts, before graduating to the syntax. Now we feel once they see the culmination of their technical thoughts in front of them, on the screen, compiling and running effectively, they will have an increased drive to code and will attain a greater level of satisfaction at the end of class.
