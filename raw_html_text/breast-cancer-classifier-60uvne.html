                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just needed something to do. A few of my concepts didn't work out and I overslept. After that, I decided to do what I knew best. Machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the data from a bunch of samples of suspicious breast tissues and tries to predict if it is benign or malignant. Malignant tissues are dangerous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tons of sweat, tears, and anxiety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't determine the correlation between the diagnoses and its' factors. It had something to do with the data type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to develop more software.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    More testing. More editing.
