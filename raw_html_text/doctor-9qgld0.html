                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our time in and out of the hospital, one thing we noticed was that paramedics would always give the triage nurses paper forms for them to read over and transcribe.  This is an incredibly slow process that may delay a patients assessment.  We decided to make an app where you can just take a picture with your phone and it would automatically enter all the information on those forms into a database, ready to be used for any application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can take a picture using their smartphone, and using the Azure Computer Vision API, dOCtoR uses Optical Character Recognition to extract different data fields and their entry from medical forms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basis of the app is Microsoft Azure's OCR API which returns a JSON object upon uploading a picture.  The JSON is then parsed by an in-house JSON parser which submits the results to an SQLite database.
                </p>

                        We don't need to implement OCR algorithms if we use APIs

                <p>
                    Although the parts work independently, we have to put everything together.  Some of the implementations need to be refined and we also would like to expand to iOS support.
