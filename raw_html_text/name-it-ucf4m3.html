                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first game, not to mention web app, there was a major learning curve. Design and development on major game elements, complexity of the game, and research took a great deal more time than what we initially had planned. Trying to keep the game simple and creative but true our educational perspective was the biggest challenge of design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we were finishing backend and getting frontend development underway, we ran into some trouble when our original Python code and associated web app frameworks would not run on the server. We had to write the entire program a second time, starting from scratch with a language that no one on the team has had previous experience with before (
                    <em>
                        node.js

                    ), in less than 15 hours.
