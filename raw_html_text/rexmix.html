                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is given to an existing problem in CUCEI, we might even say with no risk of error that exists in UdeG, and miscommunication there. Eg, when there is a call for an economic scholarship the department of scholarships and exchanges is in charge of posting these notices on their Facebook profile, which means that to be informed about these scholarships must be friends of the unit responsible in social networks and even so for diverse reasons it is difficult to know about it. That is where our
                    <strong>
                        app
                    </strong>
                    comes to replace those media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application shows in the form of cards, using the Material Desing from Google interface, information concerning the university. Information as invitations for scholarships, academic programs, job listings and more. Thus also the coordinators of the careers can create new cards with notices to that in this way the students and professors can be aware about it. A more useful is for massive events of each university center, such as the Divec CUCEI Fest. You can use our application for events and to be informed about which conferences, workshops and cultural events are being offered.

                <p>
                    We build it with the develoment tool Bluemix and python.

                <p>
                    The principal challenge that we face with the app is that it is not used or accepted by the student community.

                <p>
                    The first step is to consolidate the app in CUCEI as the preferred mode of communication for the university to communicate about everything you have to be reported. Then it will be all the university network.
