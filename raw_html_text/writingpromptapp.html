                <p>
                    This is a tool so simple, so pure at its core that it could appeal to anybody: unstimulated amateur writers, students who want the practice, seasoned professionals, disorganized freelancers,  aspiring authors, bored hermits, and so on!

                    ○ Access to unlimited prompts curated by other people just like you
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ Each day a new awaiting prompt will be signified by a blue pencil button at the bottom of the screen; once you've completed today's prompt, this will be replaced by a green check mark congratulating you for your work!...until the next time
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ The prompts themselves will be unpredictable: silly, nuanced, mind-blowing, or dark...but always thought-provoking, getting you itching to write down your first line
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ Always know when you last modified a response as it is stated at the bottom of each list cell
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ Keep responses safe and intact in your account for your viewing pleasure no matter what device you choose to log in from!
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ Press the cute robot button linking to the profile of the ingenious Reddit user who contributed to the current prompt, where you can feel free to start a conversation, search through any others they've submitted to the site, and maybe even delve into the world of /r/WritingPrompts itself (highly recommended).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ○ All users will encounter the same daily prompt, optimal for discussion and brainstorm with fellow writers
