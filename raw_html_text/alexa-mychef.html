                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're two Umass Amherst students who want to spread the benefits of nutrition to as many people as we can. To that end, we decided to use this hackathon as an opportunity to make Alexa into a compact, nutrition assistant.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa MyChef will allow for on the fly meal suggestions and nutritional facts based on our own preset information as well as food data from the USDA. Preempt any suggestion with "Alexa ask my chef - "

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyChef was built node.js and clay for the coding, using amazon developer services to set up the necessary voice dependencies.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main features we desired to implement was constructing a meal from our data. Now while had all the data needed for construction, we found that creating strings for alexa to say based on the data to be broken.
