                <p>
                    When it comes to traveling and exploring in a city, we feel that local knowledge is often the best source of advice. Locals know the best places to visit, the obscure hole-in-the-wall restaurants that make the best food, the most efficient ways to get around, and answers to many obscure questions that you won't find answers to on Google. We believe there should be a platform that allows everyone to capitalize on this valuable source of information.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cityslate uses a Firebase Realtime Database from Google Cloud for its backend data storage. The mobile app is built with React Native and Expo, making it cross-compatible with both iOS and Android. We use various React Native component libraries and public npm packages throughout the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used React Native before, so learning it as we went was a huge added challenge. We broke things often and spent a lot of time debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a functional app prototype and learning a brand new mobile framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript async is harder than it looks. There's an npm package for everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cityslate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features, such as more robust user accounts and reputation, search, editing tools, and smart question/answer ranking.
