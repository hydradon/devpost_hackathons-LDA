                <p>
                    HCA-21 redefines healthcare. The US national health expenditure (NHE) in 2015 was

                    , $9,990 per person. It accounted for 17.8% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2016-25, the NHE is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.6% per year and will reach close to

                        20%
                    </a>
                    of GDP by 2025. In 2009-14, the personal healthcare spending in the US grew at an average rate of 3.9% per year. A principal reason behind the continuing rise in healthcare expenditure is inefficient, limited, and fragmented use of ground-breaking technologies such as, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, &amp; automation. Perhaps the healthcare industry has been a little bit hesitant in taking full advantage of the wonders of the 21st century. HCA-21 aims to change that.

                    This command uses infermedica.com API's
                    <code>
                        /parse
                    </code>
                    &amp;

                        /diagnosis
                    </code>
                    endpoints. The
                    <code>
                        /parse
                    </code>
                    endpoint uses Natural Language Processing (NLP). The command requests the user to enter their sex, male or female, and then their age. Then it requests the user to express what they are feeling. This question accepts plain text input in English with a limit of 1,024 characters. The spelling error in the Testing section in the answer to this question is intentional and demonstrates the command's capability to deal with spelling errors. The command can also interpret some negated mentions and that is also demonstrated in the answer to this question. The command extracts the symptom mentions from the plain text input and sends those to the
                    <code>
                        /diagnosis
                    </code>
                    endpoint as evidence along with sex and age. The endpoint returns a follow-up question along with an array of conditions with their respective probabilities. The command then asks the follow-up question to the user. The user can answer in
                    <code>
                        yes
                    </code>
                    or
                    <code>
                        no
                    </code>
                    and anything else is treated as
                    <code>
                        i don't know
                    </code>
                    . The user response is used to determine another symptom which is pushed into the evidence array and resent to the
                    <code>
                        /diagnosis
                    </code>
                    endpoint along with sex and age. The endpoint is stateless so the new symptom must be sent to the endpoint along with all previously submitted symptoms. The endpoint again returns a follow-up question and an array of conditions with their respective probabilities. This process is repeated until the first condition returned has a probability more than 90% or the interview reaches the 10th question, including the
                    <code>
                        What are you feeling?
                    </code>
                    question. In the end of the diagnosis, the user receives the result of the diagnosis, a list of possible conditions with their respective probabilities.

                <p>
                    This command uses the betterdoctor.com API to retrieve accurate provider information. The command begins by requesting the user to enter his choice,
                    <code>
                        a
                    </code>
                    for doctor information and

                    </code>
                    for practice information. If the user enters anything else the question will be repeated. If the user chooses
                    <code>
                        a
                    </code>
                    , the command will request the user to enter doctor name, US state postal code, and keyword. The keyword is for narrowing down the search. If the user is searching for doctors who specialize in family medicine, the key word can be
                    <code>
                        family
                    </code>
                    . The command will return a list of doctors who match the specified criteria. For each doctor, the user will get, Name, Gender, Languages, Bio, Specialties, &amp; Practices. If the user chooses
                    <code>
                        b
                    </code>
                    , the command will request the user to enter practice name and US state postal code. The command will return a list of practices matching the specified criteria. For each practice, the user will get, Name, Address, Languages, &amp; Phones. If you see repetition in phone numbers, that's because it's a common practice to use the same number for landline and fax. This command also supports "not applicable or available" input. To indicate that an input is not applicable or available, the user needs to enter
                    <code>
                        na
                    </code>
                    . It should be used on a limited basis as the command cannot search for providers if all inputs are
                    <code>
                        na
                    </code>
                    . For retrieving doctor information,
                    <code>
                        /doctors
                    </code>
                    endpoint, and for retrieving practice information,
                    <code>

                    </code>

HCA-21 puts a weapon the stakeholders in healthcare need to fight this menace and ensure high-quality medical care for everyone while bringing down the costs at the same time. HCA-21 would not come into existence without Cisco Spark &amp; Botkit. The tireless efforts of engineers at Cisco Spark have made it a unique platform which has the power to revolutionize healthcare at its core. During development of HCA-21, wonderful support was received from the Cisco Spark Developer Support Team. Botkit is now a bot developer's first choice for building a Cisco Spark bot due to its modular and simple architecture and lucid documentation. The effort the Howdy Team has put into Botkit &amp; Botkit Studio is admirable without a doubt. HCA-21 puts highly valuable information from reputed sources within the reach of all stakeholders in healthcare, and that has the potential to change the US healthcare for the better.
