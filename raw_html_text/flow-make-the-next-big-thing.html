                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My main inspiration for this project was my own way of zoning out to develop and come up wth new ideas, which is an experience we're trying to simulate in a fully Virtual Reality
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   Creates a virtual workflow with ideas contributed by your teammates, which swirl around in the empty space with you, letting you think of ways they could be better or how they could link

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  I utilized Unreal Engine. Mostly blueprint programming.
</code></pre>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  I learned some more about using Unreal in a way other than videogames, which is definitely an interesting experience

                    What's next for Flow: Make the next Big Thing
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   - Editability (Being able to feed inputs to the VR remotely, hopefully even live while someone uses it!)
            -Being able to move ideas around to your liking, no need to rely on the preset patterns! (may or may not be a good idea to migrate to Vive)
   -Support for more structured diagrams and ability to re-structure and re-evaluate them
