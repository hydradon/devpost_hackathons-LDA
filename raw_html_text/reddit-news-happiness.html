                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am part of many communities online, but I have found that many people in each community often have varying views on the quality of their subreddit. My goal is to use more outside and automated ways to answer the question: "Which subreddit has it worse?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the top news links on each subreddit looked at. Once it has these, it sends the contents of each article over to Microsoft Azure, which uses its language processing to return a value of 0 to 1 based on how negative the article was. My program then averages these result for each subreddit and displays it as a graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each subreddit gets a "Happiness Index" where a higher score means that the articles there are more positive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built entirely with python libraries. I used
                    <code>
                        Praw
                    </code>
                    to access Reddit's API,
                    <code>
                        Article
                    </code>
                    to download and get the contents of each article,
                    <code>
                        Microsoft Azure
                    </code>
                    to process the articles, and
                    <code>
                        matplotlib
                    </code>
                    to finally plot out the result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Testing this script was fairly difficult, as even a small dataset of 15 articles takes a while to download and parse. There were also bugs that would only reveal themselves
                    <em>
                        after
                    </em>
                    I would wait for 10 - 15 minutes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used any of the above technologies in one of my projects, so I have learned quite a bit the different technologies involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One common sentiment I have seen is that
                    <code>
                        r\politics
                    </code>
                    is seen as more depressing than other subreddits. Looking at the output, this is confirmed with the numbers! As well, we see that
                    <code>
                        r\UpliftingNews
                    </code>
                    is near the top, which is also to be expected from this report!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to access various web API's and how to deal with downloading and parsing articles with scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reddit News Happiness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of filtering by the communities that share the articles, we can filter by the source of the article itself, to see how positive or negative each news publisher is. Another way we could go is to try and read regular text posts, which could give a different answer to "What is the most depressing subreddit"
