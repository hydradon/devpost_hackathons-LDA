                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a huge population of elders. They need company and love. However, we don&rsquo;t have time to hear all of their stories although we care about their stories a lot. 
LEGEND is an APP that will help trigger the elders&rsquo; memories and record their stories. Then LEGEND will convert their stories to text, show their life footprints, family trees, and encourage them to find people with similar experience in our online community.
Then, their stories and spirits get to be passed on to the next generation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Home screen: The stories page displays the stories with the date it is recorded. I can click on the recordings and listen to it or read the converted text. 
Add recordings: I can click to record my own memory about this specific prompt or event.  When it is done, it will be automatically converted. If I don&rsquo;t have anything to tell about this prompt, I can swipe to the next prompt. I can listen to other people&rsquo;s recordings as well. 
Footprint: Automatically recognize the content of the recordings and link it to the timeline. It shows the life of a person since birth, 
Family Tree: This feature displays the family tree, where the user can read or listen to the memories with their family members and friends. 
Community allows users to share their memory with other people. I can search for other interesting stories as well.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with React Native, using AWS Transcribe API for speech to text transcription, using AWS Comprehend to extract keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First challenge is UI design. We used photoshop to build our first UI, and we talked to people in Westfield UTC, and neighbors. They suggested that we should use warm color and user-friendly UI for the elders. So we redesign our UI design several times. Second challenge is the APP building. We build the APP from scratch, and stay up for almost two nights. Third challenge is AWS. We use Amplify (AWS API for React-native) to get the key words from voice records, so the users can have a text overview to their memos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon, we&rsquo;ve made an app with a high degree of completion. Besides, we learnt a lot about the elderly. We heard the story of lovely ladies and gentlemen, and had a deeper knowledge about the years before we were born. We were shared with the collective memories other than those numerical history written on history books. 
It is really proud of us that we did find what the elderly need. And we start to know about the history we are carrying on, and the responsibility we must shoulder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Process of marketing research
Use of AWS into related product
Frontend develop and testing of app
Business pitch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Legend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will make an easy-to-understand user guide for our users (both in audio and visual form) 
We will do more marketing research on the elderly so that we will make our app more attractive and adoptable.
We will add a robust backend to the app.
We will implement the record and play audio functions on smart home devices, allowing visually impaired users to enjoy our app
