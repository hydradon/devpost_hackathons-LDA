                    An iOS app that recognizes faces using Core ML and displays the identified person's Business Card if they have registered for the app. Additionally, the user is given the option to save the business card to the app's local library which can be sorted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split our team into two groups which worked on front-end and back-end respectively. After a few hours of thorough researching, we managed to make the app open up the camera, click a picture and send the picture as an input to the machine learning file. The machine learning file had been trained with the face models of various members of the team prior to being integrated into the app folder. The ML file processed the image and then returned the name of the predicted person, which was then sent to firebase for the remaining details on the person. Using these details, an activity containing the registered business card of the person detected.
