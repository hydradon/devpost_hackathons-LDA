                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people are tired from the usual fast-food type food and are looking for unique food from all over the world. A lot of people are addicted to South Asian food such as Indian dishes. I wanted to create this Amazon skill so people can learn more about other types of South Asian food more specifically, Nepali food. One usually assumes that Nepali food is mainly soup and such due to the Himalayas but I can surely tell you that is not the case! Enable this Amazon skill to explore some unique Nepali food!

                <p>
                    It is an amazon skill which you can enable it in your amazon device. From there on, let your voice guide you!
