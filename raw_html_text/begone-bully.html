                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for making this program is brought by the pain of having to watch our fellow classmate get bullied on a daily basis. We strongly believe that if he used our program, maybe he would understand how to stand up for himself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Begone, Bully is a program that simulates having a bully. As the bully continues to taunt and tease, an assistant pops up with choices for how to respond to the situation. Some of the choices are better than others, and the assistant helps you realize the best way to react and take further steps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Divya and I built this program by using an application called Codesters. We wrote the code in python, using some of the open-source that Codesters provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As easy as it seemed, Codesters was much harder to manage than we thought. Especially being first-time hackers, we found it difficult to debug and troubleshoot some of the confusing issues Codesters gave us. In one particular issue, it took 4 mentors to finally figure out what the problem and solution was. Sometimes, it seemed as if we would just have to give in to a variety of 'unfixable' errors, but thankfully we pushed through and managed to create a product we were proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our favorite part of this whole process was getting to create our logo. Although we couldn't incorporate it into our final product, we were extremely proud of the work we put into it and loved the way it looked at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to push through problems even when we felt exhausted and craved sleep. At the end of the day though, the best thing we learned was how to stage.wait, among other functions that we know we'll use in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Begone, Bully
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, as time progresses we'll be able to ease off of Codesters and get into hard-core Python. Plus, we are planning on making a more informational portion of the app, where users will be able to read tips and trips on how to avoid bullying, how to recognize it, and much, much, more.
