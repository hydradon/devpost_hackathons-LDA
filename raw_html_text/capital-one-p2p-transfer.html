                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main drive was to become more familiar with cloud based technologies, more specifically AWS. We believed that programming the Amazon echo was a great starting point to gain greater familiarity with AWS. Additionally we wanted to create a practical project that others could use and we could build upon in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows P2P transactions between Capital One users using Amazon Echo. Utilizes a pin before transactions or information can be retrieved. Maintains a user set transfer limit. Allows user to get transaction history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Capital One's nessie along with Amazon's Alexa sdk and AWS Lambda, we built an Amazon Echo application that allows Capital One users to transfer money between one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was the asynchronous tasks of the application. More specifically doing multiple ajax requests to the nessie API and attempting to get DynamoDB to work with the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully, created an interactive application that links to nessie api and can do P2P transfers between users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, AWS DynamoDB, Alexa-SDK, Capital One Nessie API
                </p>

                    What's next for Capital One P2P Transfer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect with DynamoDB, create a more secure encryption strategies, two-factor authentication.
