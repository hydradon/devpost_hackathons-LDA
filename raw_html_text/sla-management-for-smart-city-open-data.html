                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasingly government departments around the world are offering up open data as a service to their citizens. This is often done using the CKAN platform. Unfortunately, most of these services are offered on a best effort basis and represent a shaky foundation for third parties to build apps and offer commercial services. There is  clear need for cost effective and ideally open source service assurance solutions which can alert the data providers about outages. We are illustrating how an existing open source service assurance platform can be effectively applied to this task
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution performs synthetic json transactions against the various data sources and reports on the service availability as perceived from the user perspective. It allows a business service view to be constructed which shows how a service which utilises several data sources will  be effected by an outage in a sub component.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build an OpenNMS platform on Bluemix and integrated this with Elastic Search and Kibana also hosted on Bluemix. We configure polling of the json services on a 5 minute basis for a selection of services listed in

                    </a>
                    . We tested the ideas by talking to various government representatives as we built the demonstration. We utilised the latest feature rleased in the last few months by the OpenNMS project called 'Business Service Management' to give a topology view of the managed services. We built a TM Forum SLA interface for OpenNMS to allow user to register for SLA events.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the json api's and working out the best way to poll them to exercise the back end.
Data Quest stopped supplying their GIS map tiles yesterday (July 11th) disrupting the gis view of services.

                    SLA and Trouble Ticket interfaces
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last Hackathon we added the TM Forum trouble ticket API to OpenNMS. This would probably be the preferred interface for dealing with trouble. However this hack we worked on the SLA interface but just implemented the notification profile for clients which register for notifications.
