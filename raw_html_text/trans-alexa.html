                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TransAmerica wanted to have an automated conversation application to help them with leads in marketing. We delivered exactly that, and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first iteration of the application is exactly what was asked for in the sheet they gave us. With further iterations, we built a twilio calling system to call the user after a certain amount of time after their initial experience, and we also added some extra intents to handle some inquiries users might have about the product. We integrated twilio to call users after a certain amount of time, but we ran out of Twilio credits. We even have an API endpoint in which admins can upload custom brochures and information to custom intents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using twilio's API, Flask-Ask, Flask, and a little bit of smtpblib
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with the Flask-ask documentation. It was really badly documented, and we had problems understanding how to implement many of the features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we got it working so quickly, and it's really effective!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to never trust rogue developers to write good documentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trans-Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    World Domination! Perhaps a general template for an Alexa application that can be adopted by many different companies and users
