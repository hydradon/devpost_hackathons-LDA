                    We learnt ReactJS in a introductory course. We were fascinated with the abilities of ReactJS and decided to come up with a project of our own using ReactJS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project is a simple expenditure tracker website. We used Firebase as our backend database to record user's expenditure. We also used Firebase Authentication to secure access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learnt from tutorial videos and applied it to our own project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ReactJS and Firebase were very new to us so we struggled with the syntax and integrating the platforms together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first webpage we have built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are now more familiar with ReactJS and Firebase and also about interactive user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this project, it had definitely motivated us to come up with more projects of our own.
