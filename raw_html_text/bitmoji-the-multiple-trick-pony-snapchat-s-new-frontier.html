                    We grew up in a generation where games connected us. Social games, games that involved deduction and personal knowledge about one another were the connections we formed between one another. From Mii Play to Charades to Clue, games brought us together even as technology began to pull us apart. 
Today, it feels a lot different. Yet everyone yearns to be connected still. Looking at the successes of social gaming apps such as Game Pigeon and 8 ball pool, people play games to make friends and to make friendships better. In Snapchat and Bitmoji, we realized the potential in Bitmoji's unique avatars, seeing their similarities to the beloved Miis from the Nintendo Wii. From Guess Who?(tm), a game where each guess narrowed down the suspects, to Find Mii, a change there is a wide range of games that could be developed that utilize the full extent of bitmojis. In particular, we were excited about the potential of Guess Who in fostering human interaction and serving as a conversation helper, similar to Game Pigeon. With the chance to develop online networks and the ability to utilize Snapchat's friend lists to create mutual friend avatar pools, options that were not available to us in the last 22 hours, our website/app could emphasize the human connections and relationships that we all live in today and emphasize the unique qualities that Snapchat has to offer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our limits were situational, revealing even more potential within Bitmoji than we had realized before. However, neither of us had any experience building apps, and only very limited HTML/ CSS/JS knowledge between us, forcing us to use the web option and capitalize on the login. Both of us are taking AP Comp Sci at the high school level, and have worked almost exclusively in java in the past. We found a seemingly easy to use javascript library ("Libmoji") and had a lot of trouble getting it to work.
In the end, we were able to make a simple match game using urls that we generated from the snapchat login, with a few non-automated steps in between. Other game modes could be created from using match as a basis quite easily.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenge one: not knowing how to code apps
We played off of the strengths of the Login kit for web
Challenge two: not being able to create an online network in time w 2 people
We created a timed demo that could easily be extrapolated online (just like Game Pigeon)
Challenge three: not enough time to understand the traits engine for Bitmoji
We used randomized poses of me, rather than randomized characteristics in the demo
Challenge four: not knowing how to use github
We made two separate parts of the program
Challenge five: after attempting to use Node.js and PHP for a little bit, we had to abandon online features for the core game and for the authorization.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an idea and we were able to implement a working version of it by the end. 
Going into this hackathon, we had very little knowledge about the majority of the concepts we used in our project and we were still able to create something, learning a lot the whole way. I'm also proud of the website I made; I had a good sense of design but no experience to match it.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Bitmoji the multiple-trick pony:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More time to figure out the Libmoji library, making randomized traits would make the whole project more aesthetically pleasing and the games more fun. I honestly think the idea has a lot of potential, even if our implementation was limited by our current skill level. From a solid login-&gt;bitmoji-&gt; random generation, creating new games is relatively easy, and server creation etc, search functions, friend networks would require instruction, but we think it will be simple in principle. We also would have definitely done an app if we knew swift.
