                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are six different dining halls on campus, each with menus that they post online. However, they only post that day's menu! And I want to know if any of them are serving steelhead trout, a favorite dish of mine. It's a hassle to go to six different links just to see if they have a word, so why not make an extension that does that?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a search term as well as at least one URL (and title for the URL). It searches for that search term in those URLs, and lets you know if it finds a match. It also displays the title of the website with the match!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using HTML (with CSS) and Javascript. I also used JQuery, Node.js, and Express.js, and got a lot of help from mentors and friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time writing Javascript, so it was an adventure to learn on the fly how to use it. Additionally, due to the cross-origins policy, websites would only accept a request for data if it came from a server, so I had to set up a quick one capable of passing information between the extension and the website.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering I went into this without knowing
                    <em>
                        anything
                    </em>
                    , I'm happy that it works! And fairly well!

                <p>
                    How to use HTML and Javascript together, how to set up a server (a localhost for now), how useful a nice cup of Joe is late at night after only four hours of sleep...

                <p>
                    I want to be able to search for multiple terms, each with their own list of websites, at once!
