                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to buy a bag of Doritos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user searches for a product, Doridos returns the stores which are geographically closest to the user along with the corresponding prices for the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Once the user searches for a product, two actions occur. The first is that the product is sent to a web crawler, which returns the retailers that offer the product. The URLs of the pages containing the product are then sent to a web scraper which looks through the pages for the price, retailer's name, and other product information. The information is then pushed to a database (MongoDB) which is then retrieved by the Javascript to be displayed on the web page. The second thing that occurs is that the Google Maps api is called and the geographical locations of the retailers closest to the user are displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to push and retrieve information from MongoDB. Another problem we had was accessing information cross-languages (i.e., calling Python using Javascript)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully built a web crawler, web scraper, and used the Google Maps api without having previous experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use various libraries and softwares such as jsoup, ajax, and etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doridos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve speed of operation.
