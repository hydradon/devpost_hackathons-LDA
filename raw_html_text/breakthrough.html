                    Proposed: Homeless problem is not just based on employment and housing.
While it can be in San Jose, we wanted to find a solution we could apply anywhere.
Focusing on work wages or house prices is not enough to address the scope of homelessness outside San Jose.
Even in states where housing prices are lowered and minimum wage jobs are available, the homeless rate remains high.
We want to reach out to communities, giving people with busy everyday lives an easy, quick way to help others.
Even to the software industry, showing people that technology can be heartfelt, solving both technical and social problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution: People can submit the location and description of an area they found homeless people in Outreach programs get notified.
Building community incentive: reward program, point system. Business, restaurants, and fast-food chains reward users with coupons, and could also donate to charity. For example, a burger coupon for you is a donation to charity as well by the company. In turn, these partners working with us get the benefit of advertisement for their own business, and build a good name for themselves, as people get rewarded to try their products.
