                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A random thought about how to implement both Google Cloud and Nexmp to do something amazing that we would personally use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enables you to listen to music without an internet connection. You can just call a number, request a song and it will play the music you want from youtube. For those who are familiar with the gaming community &amp;&amp; Discord, it's like a Rhythm Bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud and Nexmo to develop our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, there were plenty. Figuring out how to deploy nodejs on Google CLoud platform, how to store files, stream only the audio from youtube and getting the things to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with something that we would personally use! We managed to create something from scratch using technologies that we haven't used before and created something amazing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned, that managing the workspace is very important, but not as important and backing up the progress you've made. It's a matter of a single error in judgment, and the whole thing explodes in errors and then you're just sitting there and thinking about how you ended up in this very moment. What events in your life lead to this disaster. Maybe you should've dropped the uni and become a streamer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unrequitedmusic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it a scalable service that could even compete with the likes of Spotify and SoundCloud. I mean, the call rates are incredibly cheap, to the point where you could listen to music off of youtube for free without needing access to the internet and for around 2 dollars a month. Now that sounds awesome to me!
