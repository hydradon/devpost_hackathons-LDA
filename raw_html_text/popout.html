                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We challenged ourselves to think outside of the box! We became inspired by DC universitys' culture to 'Pop Out' and we wanted to incorporate that theme to help underserved communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Underserved areas in District are not obtaining enough outside traffic, hurting the financial revenue of the area.
POPout facilitates events that bring consumers into underserved communities.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used HTML &amp; CSS with repl.it.
