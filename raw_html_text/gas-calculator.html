                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really don't like doing ideal gas law problems in chemistry, so I set out to make a tool so I no longer have to do them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in any three of pressure, volume, temperature, or moles, and returns the value for the fourth of an ideal gas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built an Interface object that got input from the user and converted their input into units convenient for calculations and then sent those numbers to a Calculator object which was able to calculate the fourth value. The calculator then gave that back to the interface object, which printed it out.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly syntax bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The unit converter is really convenient to use and it has most of the commonly used units.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I should separate functions between my objects better. The conversion of units should've been done in the calculator object, not the interface object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gas calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving unit conversion from the interface object to the calculator object. Also make mass and element make-up an option as input for the moles aspect.
