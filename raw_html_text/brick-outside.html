                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly one in ten americans are living in abnormaly dry areas, this quantity reaches up to 1 in 3 americans near november. Brick Outside helps people in areas vulnerable to drought to better take care of their plants by integrating an array of sensors and features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It measures soil moisture, temperature and atmospherical condition and sends the data to our integrated cloud platform for user monitoring
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device was built by combining several sensors into an arduino board. A series of servers were put on place to recieve and process the data sent by the device. Finally, a react web client was created for user interaction
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating a propietary cloud platform for the project. Additionally, the web application looks very nice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about distrbuted systems and their applications, moreover, we learned about the interaction of serial monitors and the internet. Finally, we learned more about I/O streams.
