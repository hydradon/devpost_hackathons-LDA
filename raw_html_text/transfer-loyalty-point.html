                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain is the hot topic nowadays, so my team felt it was amazing to explore and experience. This is the reason why we joined the blockchain track of Hack Junction competition.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My product was created to deal the problem relating to the loyalty points for consumers. We had a contract to require all partners (the business companies or groups) to follow to our rules for changing from "real money" to the points. And consumers would have an account for accumulating the points instead of a lot of accounts of different companies to earn and use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the smart contracts in Solidity and created a front-end website in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was related to NoteJS, so we could not understand clearly about it and we have not had experience with this language as well. This caused that we could not apply it in our project although we tried so many times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt quite pleased with smart contracts that we've already done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of things we learnt from our product. We knew more about Infinito API and smart contracts. We understood clearly of the function for transferring points from the current address to another even though we could not complete it in our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Transfer Loyalty Point
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expect that our idea of Transfer Loyalty Point can become real in the daily life. It will bring a lot of convenience for consumers and maybe open a new world for e-business.
