                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Pre-Hackathon Discovery Sessions, &ldquo;If a Crew Leader could know that someone is getting too hot&rdquo;, and/or &ldquo;if the Crew Leader could know that someone is slowing down in their productivity, track heat exhaustion/dehydration (or proper hydration)&rdquo; would be extremely valuable to improve farmworkers health. For our platform, we implement a solution to these problems by using the open-source Fit-Bit and its API to track data from the farmworkers. The farm-workers will wear this device during their shift and collect data such as: heartbeat, steps/movements, and level of activity. The data collected will be uploaded to cloud-computing through bluetooth every time they clock in, clock out and clock for their break/lunch. The data will upload under an account for every company and every company will be under an OSHA account. This data will help each company and OSHA understand what is happening real time in the workplace, and will allow them to adapt features to their workplace depending on the workers&rsquo; health conditions.
