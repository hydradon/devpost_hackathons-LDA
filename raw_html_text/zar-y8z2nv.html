                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terminator movie.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use a device that has a camera to recognize some Image Targets and projects different augmented elements on the device screen over the real images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vuforia SDK in Unity3D. Vuforia comes with support for AR elements such ARCamera or ImageTargets and Unity3D helps us to build a virtual environment on top of the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focused on presenting some of the key elements of the AR world  when some predefined images are recognized by the device: play a movie, interact with objects (open, close elements), keep on-screen information like the weather, new emails, clock etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of challenges, for example, it was much more difficult than we thought to configure the objects to stay in place, in a virtual 3D world and interact with them.
                </p>
