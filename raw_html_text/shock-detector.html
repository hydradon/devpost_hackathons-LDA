                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many packages that have been shipped don't reach their destination in a supposed state. So we wanted to make something to track that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This shock detector detects the motion of the package and reports to the web server when it reaches a certain limit. It sends the date and time of the event. Then the package owner/carrier can get information about when the event actually happened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the web server which sends the info to cell phone of the user but it kept on crashing so there were problems connecting with the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time of making an android app so we are proud that we at least did something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use the tools like android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shock Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will keep on working and see how it can better. We want to include the ability to send the data directly to the server of the carrier so that they could decide if they want to send the data to the user or keep it to themselves for research or so on.
