                    The Coleman Foundation _____
What is the problem we are solving? 
Creating an easier way to find the files that people need to find. We don't know of any applications that can find a specific file based on its content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who are the Users/customers?
The messy computer users. Users with not much organization on their computer folders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's currently missing that they need and which your solution provides?
They need organization in their files, or at least a quick and easy way to find the files they need. We offer that, in a great intuitive way and beautiful UI.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are always struggling to find the exact files they need when searching through their computer. We hate the headaches these situations create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application scans a file directory/folder, looks for specific file types (.txt, .docx, etc..). We copy those files into a new folder to get ready for crawling. We crawl every file for the specific word or phrase that the user desires, then we output results based on our own algorithm, to what we feel is the best match for those keywords/phrases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Flask, Java, Python, and tried to implement all of the output data to the web browser but it became extremely difficult being that Java does not run on web. We then switch to Node.js and built a javascript file to crawl the files instead. All of the information is inputted and outputted through Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to run a Java application with any web related ideas, or Firebase. We also ran into alot of walls when it came to the logic of crawling files.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, for our first hackathon together, we accomplished alot and have much to show for it. We all learned about different technologies that we did not know before coming here. We are all very proud of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Java, Node.js, Python packages, Front-end development, and many other technologies.

                <p>
                    We will take this new infomation and build better applications that will be used by many people!
