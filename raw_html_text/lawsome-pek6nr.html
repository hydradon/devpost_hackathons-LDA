                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few weeks ago I took part in a mock trial. I wrongly convicted an innocent man based on his own testimony. Perhaps if he had known he had the right to not take the stand, he wouldn't have been convicted. Many are not aware of their simple legal rights, like requesting a new barrister or whether the police can search you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the legal information and laws you would need is condensed and simplified into one app and website so everyone, regardless of background, has access to this vital information. The app itself is free. The app and website can also train up amatuers. These are called lawsome ambassadors who will help run workshops in schools, especially rural schools who may not have a local garda&iacute; station and socioeconomically disadvantaged. A community of people teaching and learning together, working towards a future where everyone has access to information and everyone is completely equal before the law.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering the information was extremely difficult as was developing the demo. But these were overcome with help from others.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the overall idea. It's a real move towards making the world fairer and more justified. It can also aid those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I further developed my coding skills and web and app development skills. I also got even more informed on various trivial elements of the law

                    What's next for Lawsome
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to run a variety of workshops in schools as well as getting both the app and website up and running.
