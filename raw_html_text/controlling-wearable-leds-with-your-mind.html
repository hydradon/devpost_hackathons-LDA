                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend and I were discussing what I should do for the Hackathon. He jokingly said "you should control LEDs with your mind! I accepted the challenge and wanted to see if I could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to start getting into Wearable Hardware, so I figured it would be cool to make them wearable LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You wear the Mind Wave headset and an unconnected T-Shirt with Flora LEDs sewn into it. The color of the LEDs will vary from Green to Red depending on Relaxed (Green) or Focused (Red) your mind is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The headset  came with a USB RF Dongle for interfacing with a PC.  I made some hardware modifications to the RF Dongle to redirect the communications to an Adafruit Flora (Wearable Arduino). I wrote an Arduino Sketch to control the RF Dongle based on Neurosky's documented protocol [3] and a guide on their Developer Wiki [2]. The Sketch receives periodical updates from the Dongle as to the wearer's meditative and focus levels, and varies the colors of the Flora LEDs based on them. I also added a chain of 4 Adafruit Flora NeoPixels to add to the effect. All of this was sewn onto the Hackathon 2015 shirt!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did do research related hacks that some other people had done with the Mindwave headset beforehand to get an idea what I was in for. Special thanks for a wealth of information that helped make this possible. I referred to the following resources:

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Number 1 challenge was sewing!  Sewing is hard!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of power related issues--because I am not using the USB on the RF Dongle, it needs to be powered from the Flora system. This plus the Flora plus 4 NeoPixels apparently was too much for the standard Flora power system.I had to to cut out 2 of the NeoPixels to get it to function again, and it is still a little flaky. Given more time, I would be looking to set up a beefier battery-based power system that could sufficiently support everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electrical signals emitted from the brain are very subtle and can be difficult to reliably read in noisy environments. I had to leave the DHF and do some of my work at home because there was too much activity in the air.

                    Learning to sew!  Doing a hardware hack without [completely] destroying a $80 piece of hardware. Getting to play with wearables. Having the coolest shirt at the Hackathon! Met a bunch of cool knowledgeable people.

                    I learned to sew [kind of]. Learned a bit about brain control interfaces and wearables.

                    1 I'd like to fix the power issues and see what else I can control with my mind, and also try to adapt what I did to more practical scenarios. There is a lot of potential for helping people with disabilities with brain control interfaces.
