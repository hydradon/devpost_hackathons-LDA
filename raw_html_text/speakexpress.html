                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create SpeakExpress by the many non-native English speakers I've encountered throughout my life who've expressed intimidation &amp; discouragement in practicing their English speaking skills in everyday situations. I've observed that this barrier frequently leads to significantly reduced opportunities for economic advancement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows people to register and create a profile page. They then can browse profiles of native English speakers and learners &amp; submit a "request" or "invite". Once someone receives a request/invite, they then would set up a date, time, and location to meet up with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In following the "pretotype" concept to start immediately, I decided to build a bare bones landing beta webpage using html &amp; css. The website provides a brief overview of what SpeakExpress is, and a simple call to action asking interested parties to submit their email address for updates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Generating signups &amp; feedback from early adapters for testing &amp; implementation.
