                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the problems with the roommate compatibility search around the Davis area for UC Davis students.
Problems in organizing and fast effective way in finding a roommate to fill a room or a person looking for rooms around the Davis city area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes searching for roommates easier through personality tag matching similar to dating apps algorithm based matching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift for IOS development and Adobe illustrator and Invision for UX and prototype testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slow internet, creating a lag in the completeness of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of our app is very helpful for students since every student experience issues in roommate compatibility and room finding in Davis. Facebook groups are usually unorganized in hosting these types of services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to plan accordingly in downloading libraries we need before the event due to the slow internet.
                </p>
