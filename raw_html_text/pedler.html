                    Peddler is a bridge using which small businesses can reach out to previously untouched audiences and launch campaigns for targeted demographics. It leverages the power of the Messenger platform and the people connected to it for its core features.

Imagine you just moved into new city or different part in current city, and now you want some grocery for today.
