                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we noticed that many of our peers face high levels of stress and depression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The NeuroSky Mindwave EEG headset measures brain waves including levels of meditation, focus, as well as alpha, gamma, beta, delta, and gamma waves. We are using these data in our Android app to record users' emotions and give them corresponding suggestions on how to help their stress and depression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using Microsoft's Emotion API to use the EEG headset with our Android app. To build the app, we used Android Studio, JAVA, and ReactNative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, it was our first time using Android Studio, and we had problems trying to implement code from tutorials into Android Studio. We also had difficulty with connecting the headset to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team came in without knowing how to use Android Studio. At the end, we made a functional app with an API connected successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to sue Android Studio and API. We are also in the process of converting from a ReactNative app to an iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moody
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating our first headset app for Moody, we will be adding more features that focus on building one's own motivation and self-confidence. The possibilities are endless as our Moody app will be built on responses and suggestions on how to improve for the user. This includes the possibility of using the app and data to help drivers concentrate on the road of perhaps students when they are taking exams.
