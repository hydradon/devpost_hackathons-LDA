                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spoke to the representatives at Sacramento Autism Spectrum &amp; Special Needs Alliance. They said it would be helpful to have technology to help special needs students to stay organized and be successful at school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows a student to list school assignments. It currently displays three hardcoded assignments for classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I read some tutorials for iOS app development and used them as a template for my project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know about app development prior to this event, so I had to learn it all from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a simple, hardcoded display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create a simple app in swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for FocusLife
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to allow the user to input classes, include due dates, sort by subject and/or due dates, tap the labels to see a more detailed description, check off which assignments are done, input and view their class schedule, and include some way for teachers to verify that the student took note of all the assignments.
