                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our story off wanting to make a "How Related are you" site using facial recognition(almost like one of those gag sites where we compare friends), however, we didn't want people to take that as serious. So we wanted to be less serious, and what can be less serious then comparing yourself to Danny Devito?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You upload an image file of yourself, using the interface. It then runs a facial recognition algorithm which creates a delta between our lord and savior, and the mere mortal which faces him. The facial recognition algorithm works through a bitmap generated using light gradients on the face, which can be encoded and then compared against the other encoding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using FLASK for Python 3.4+, and the face_recognition library for python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into various problems submitting images through a form, at first it was initially only sending a file name, then it was sending nothing, then something but nothing useful, and finally we over came the hurdle. We also experienced some issue on the back end, in terms of building DLib, the issue involved running out of memory, and not having enough virtual memory to compensate. We also ran across various issues in generating the percentage of variance but it was all solved by investigating the face_recognition library.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we're proud of our UI, also how the team stayed together, we were having major issues with our previous attempted projects during the hackathon. We were only really able to start work on this, around 5pm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's alright to be silly sometimes, very often the laughs are what keeps you motivated and helps you cross the finish line. I also believe we all learned how to meld as a team through project management and combining our strengths.

                    What's next for How A Like Danny Devito Are You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably a next good step is associating individual files with cookies, right now you can probably confuse the server big time by two people using the site at once
