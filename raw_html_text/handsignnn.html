                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to be able to use technology in a way which benefits those most challenged in society, and this was an idea which I came up with after a long time of thought.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, it can recognize sign language with enough data and will be able to allow a better way of communication between those who are mute and those who do not know sign language by converting sign language symbols to text.
