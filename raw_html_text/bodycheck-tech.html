                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build this application to better facilitate the process for people to connect to medical experts based on their pain history.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can select the body parts that hurt you and it will record it in the database. This way, when it's been a while since you've been hurt and you now want to seek a doctor to see what's going on, it'll recommend it to you the correct doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic! We first decided on a framework. ReactJS was chosen as it 's fun and challenging! It is also one of the best frameworks for single page web applications. Additionally, a database was implemented using Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew how to use ReactJs or Firebase. Most of the time was spent learning and discovering the way these frameworks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a working website. The body parts can be clicked and hovered upon for further medical evaluation, followed by an appointment database that can be expanded to store medical history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sleep is very important. We learned ReactJS... and everything mentioned above! :D
                </p>

                    What's next for BodyCheck.Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would further clean up the design as none of us are very good at graphical user interface. Additionally, we would make it cohesive and user friendly.
