                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of
                    <strong>
                        FoodPict
                    </strong>
                    sprouted from our team when we were mentioning ideas and making an app that would tell the user what the nutrition facts of their food are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's still in development, but when it's done, it will help people choose better foods to stay healthy and still be able to share the pictures and videos with friends.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One part of our team worked on the Android version of it, while the other team worked on the website. The Android team(of course) used Java and XML, and the Web Dev team used HTML &amp; CSS with the material design

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into was being able to find a functional and free API for analyzing &amp; identifying objects in the scene. Other challenges may have taken a bit, but were not as troublesome as the API problem.

                <p>
                    One accomplishment that we're proud of is getting the Android Camera to properly open and correctly save pictures.

                    What we learned

                <p>

                    <em>
                        MAJOR KEY
                    </em>
                    that we've learned is to make some type of concept or idea before we come to the hackathon if possible.
