                <p>
                    Imagine a time where open source contributers are rewarded like normal programmers writing code for companies? Thats what we want to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projects like DLive/DTube and Steemit which provide a similar service to Content Creators like video producers or photographer.

                        Making it easier to support open source developers for users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Companies want to support open source projects they are using but struggle to do so.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Project supports Developer, which are contributing to OpenSource Projects by rewarding them for pull-requests that get merged into participating open source repositories with gitcoins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a rudimentary Cryptocurrency with Google's Dartlang.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We choose Dartlang because it's easy to learn, but yet powerful and supports a wide variety of Operating Systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frontend is connected via REST api and written in vue.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into two major challenges.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    First
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was choosing a secure signing algorithm to create trusted Transactions between multiple users.
We used pointycastle's RSA Signature Algorithm because it is commonly used by developers all around the globe.
Even though the Elliptic Curve would have been more secure.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Second
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The second challenge was to provide a peer to peer connection between two Nodes(Clients). We decided that each Node is a webserver and also an http-client. That worked out well because http communication is quite simple and fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Blockchain algorithm and the complete project came together in a nice way. We implemented a nice looking frontend in darkmode :). Also our blockchain works on distributed nodes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we just scraped the surface of cryptography and decentralized engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gitcoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to have something like this accepted and implementend by the open source community.
                </p>

                    Thanks for reading!
