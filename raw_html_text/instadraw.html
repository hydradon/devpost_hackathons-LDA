                    which strives to reach out to people with physical and/or mental disabilities and to support them through the arts. On this forum, such disadvantaged groups of people can collaborate by drawing or sharing their art, and others get an opportunity to reply back to the post through art as well. This is very similar to what happens in Instagram, however, instead of pictures people connect and share their feelings by drawing.

                    What it does and How I Built It

                <p>
                    It uses the draw example from firebase to let the user draw pictures and share it. It uses the Facebook API for sharing the drawing. Any other user can come in and look at the shared drawing and comment on it. S/he can also draw a new post and share it to the same page. It is very similar to the idea of Instagram and what it does, except for it uses drawings instead of photos. It uses Firebase Facebook token for authentication. This allows me to access Facebook API in my app, so that users can share the draw.html page with each other. Now all users can come to that page, share their drawings and comment on previous drawings as well.
