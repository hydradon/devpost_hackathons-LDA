                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be used for the robot in .the NASA RMC competition
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plots a path from origin/start point to mining area; can either set predetermined number of stop points or have them randomly generated. Can also give you a random location in the mining area or you can specify where in the mining zone you want to end up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mattlab + aid from mentors + lots of googling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to set it so that the final coord will always be within the mining zone;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!! And even gives you a lovely plot at the end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too much to list here haha. But how to overwrite matrixes, how the use the "varargin" variable to make inputs optional, etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RMC PathFinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    adding more "ifelse" statements so that it can work in sync with the object/obstacle detection components of the robot and learn whether or not the robot can run over the obstacle or if it should plot a path around it
                </p>
