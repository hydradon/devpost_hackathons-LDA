                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make the interactions between Flight Attendants and passengers less complicated and more intuitive.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This mobile app allows passengers to directly contact the flight attendant about their requests for items such as blankets, snacks, beverages...etc.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to create the basic framework of the two sister applications. One application for the passenger to request items and another application for the flight attendant to process the requests. To connect the applications we used Firebase to make a Real-Time Database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase for the first time, we ran into problems one would expect on their maiden voyage of a database engine. One particular challenge we had was reading the data on the flight attendant side. We didn't know how to traverse the data structure that we made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to get the two applications to communicate via Firebase.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement a Real-Time Database using Firebase.

                    What's next for Sky Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obvious UI improvements, as well as adding more features to the flight attendant application. We would like to use the airlines membership structures to automatically apply coupons to the passenger's order.
