                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My idea for the "Alexa Skills Challenge: Kids" was to build a skill which is entertaining but on the other hand educating. With the "10 Tricky Questions!" skill I combined these components to make a quiz for kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The principle is like a basic quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with node.js and the skill is based on the "quiz and trivia" template provided by Amazon.
                </p>

                        Integrating Speechcons without SSML
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating appropriate questions for kids

                    <li>
                        Basically I only write code in python so it was nice to realize that it is possible to write an alexa skill in node.js (with template) without knowledge in this programming language
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My first alexa kids skill

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no need to use SSML for using Speechcons
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 10 Tricky Questions!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to steadily add more questions. At the moment the Skill only contains about 50 questions, which means that questions can repeat in one session easily.
My goal is 200 questions by the end of January.
If the skill finds interest I want to add 1000 questions till the end of February.
