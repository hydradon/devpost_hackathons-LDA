                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to type is something kids can't avoid in our day of age.  Growing up, we had various classes in school that taught us how to type, but none of them were very stimulating for our young minds.  So, we decided to create "Cubey Typing Go!", inspired by our childhood adventure games, in order to appeal to the younger generations and make typing more exciting.  Not only do we want it to captivate kids, but we also wanted to hit the nostalgia factor for the parents as well.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game helps the users practice their speed and accuracy while typing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Unity and C#
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team consists of varying levels of beginners, from some knowing absolutely nothing about code to those who have only dabbled in it a little.  Because of this, we ran into many challenges when it came to learning the system with only a short amount of time.  However, we overcame it with determination, teamwork, and many, many tutorials.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to get the abstract vision in our heads into physical form.  For all of use, this is our first hackathon and the fact that we were able to put out a project was a very rewarding accomplishment.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There so many things about Unity and C# that we learned this weekend, including how to making objects move throughout the space, how to associate certain sprites we had to the corresponding group of words (words related to fire = fire sprite appears), how to do a leveling mechanism, and so much more.  But not only did we learn a lot about this program and this language, we also discovered more about how GitHub works and how useful it is in a group setting.  In addition to this, we also learned how to make our own pixelated sprites using Adobe Illustrator!

                <p>
                    Possibly fine tuning the details by adding more levels and sound effects!
