                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to navigate the teams channel of the HackPrinceton Fall 2016 Slack team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads a message in a slack channel. If it is a message looking for a member or looking for a group, it gives the user the list of members/groups that fit the description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used LUIS to interpret the message to a JSON file. Then I used C# to iterate through the list. The bot was created using Microsoft Bot Framework.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It was a fairly recent technology, so there were not many tutorials that I could take advantage of.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There was not enough data in HackPrinceton Slack channel, so I needed to create my own data to train LUIS.
                    </li>
                </ul>
