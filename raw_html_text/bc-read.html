                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using the users phone camera and google cloud OCR, we take a picture and read the text on a business card into a text file. We then parse the text into relevant categories and store them into a contact onto your phone.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We started by using tesseract for the OCR but it did not work very well.
