                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wasteful driving and the extra burning of fuel pushed us to make this web app to raise awareness and bring attention to just how much extra and unnecessary fuel people burn in their cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Green Route uses a proprietary algorithm (GreenMax) to compute the shortest and more carbon-free route possible based on your car model. It uses a combination of the Google Directions API, Google Elevation API, Vincenty's Formulae, and more to generate very accurate predictions for the carbon produced through different routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API and made our own API which calculates the route that produces the smallest amount of harmful greenhouse gases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the project, we ran into multiple problems many originating from our Cloud Datastore and Firebase login databases. Aside from those problems, we found it quite difficult to write our own API but we never hit a time where we thought it wasn't going to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For starters, we are extremely happy to see this project work the way we wanted it to which makes it very satisfying. This project has strengthened our confidence for future hackathons. It was extremely challenging to build and we didn't have a lot of time, but we managed to finish it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the project, we learned a ton about user account data storage as well as different techniques to integrate APIs into our code. We also explored various other concepts from jQuery and Entity Databases to Vincenty's Formulae and 
Exponential Moving Averages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green Route
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, if Green Route takes flight, we have plans to integrate it into cars themselves in a sort of IoT fashion. This would help reach our goal of a carbon-free tomorrow. We could also fine-tune and improve the algorithm more, to better track carbon emissions.
