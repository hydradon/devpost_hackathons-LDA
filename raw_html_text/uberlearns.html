                    UberEats inspired us. We have created a website that makes learning more accessible and affordable. All the user is required to do is choose the course they would like to take, and we will send the customer the material he or she would like to buy. Our courses are relatively affordable as a course would only cost around $20. We built this website by using javascript, HTML, and CSS. A challenge that we ran into was having a map show up, so the user could see where and when they would be receiving their materials. We are proud that we have a relatively functional and capable website. The next step for UberLearns is to improve the UI, UX, and code optimization.
