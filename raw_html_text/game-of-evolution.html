                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Conway's Game of Life
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each ant robot in the game is controlled by a Neural Network. Ant robots are divided into different tribes. Ants from different tribes can fight against each other, and those from the same tribe can reproduce. A genetic algorithm is adopted to create the new-born ants.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Echo State Network for the NN.
Genes encode the readout matrix.
Crossover by randomly swap the weights.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server does not support numpy and scipy. So the backend code cannot be run on the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a good genetic algorithm for this agent control task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's important to first install everything on the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Game of Evolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find a server that supports numpy and scipy, merge the backend and frontend, and set a website for it so that people can see how the world of ant agents evolve online.
