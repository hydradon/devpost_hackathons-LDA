                    With almost 80% of Americans owning a smartphone, one of the main goals for app developers is to develop software that aims to improve and empower the daily lives of people. 
On average, almost 1/3 of our lives is spent on getting the rest we need to function correctly. This opens up a new market for applications attempting to monitor sleep behaviors and provide the user with useful data in order to improve his sleep routine.

                <p>
                    A quick look at the current market shows that there are already extremely advanced applications that perform accurate data gathering and produce meaningful data analytics. Competing with those applications will be very challenging.

                    Sleep tracker is an android application that attempts to do just that. Sleep Tracker uses an open-source framework to gather sleep data and presents it through a very simple user interface. When monitoring sleep quality, it is crucial to get an idea of what sensor data to measure. Light is very important as it affects the plasma melatonin concentration associated with sleep quality. It is also important to measure period of heavy sleep (REM phase length) as the more heavy sleep you get, the better. To measure the REM phase, we rely on movement detection. This is most commonly done through accelerometer sensors. However, this requires the user to have the phone with him in bed, which is uncomfortable, intrusive and disliked. A creative approach used in the framework is to use accurate sound measurements to isolate movement sounds. These sounds allow us to accurately detect the beginning and end of an REM phase. Using audio also allows us to detect snoring activity as it may indicate the presence of obstructive sleep apnea. The app also measure temperature so that the user is informed of the ambient temperature in the room, which might affect sleep quality.

                    <li>
                        It is very power efficient compared to other apps, using around 10% per night compared to the 80% of other apps.

                    <li>
                        It is very simple. Only one button starts and stops recording and data. It it very simplistic compared to other apps in the market.

                    <li>
                        The framework included is open-source and so anyone can improve upon and get creative with development

                        The ability to interface the app with a pulse oxymeter allows cilinically accurate measurments that can be used by medical professionals to diagnose a large array of sleep-related disorders especially obstructive sleep apnea.
