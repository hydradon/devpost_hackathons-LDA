                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The trans community has long utilized social networks such as tumblr and instagram to share with one another the unique process that is transitioning. We wanted to think about how a modern mobile app could help facilitate similar sharing of personal experiences as well as community knowledge and resources.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create and share stories by taking selfies or by importing images from on-device albums, recording a voice narrative or typing a written one. This multimedia narrative is packaged into a story and presented in the feed. In the feed, users can pan left and write on stories to see multiple pictures in a story to visualize change as well as listen to the audio narrative to witness how one's voice might change during transition.
