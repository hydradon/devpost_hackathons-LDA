                    You&rsquo;re a woman and you enter your workplace -- it&rsquo;s just a normal day at work, but something about the setting is very abnormal. You notice you&rsquo;re one of the few women there. Or, you notice that your boss, just like most of your previous bosses, is a man. It&rsquo;s exhausting, and eventually you&rsquo;re dangerously close to feeling that strangely sad sensation of acceptance. But little do you know, you&rsquo;re a part of the 60% of undergraduate degree holders. You consist of 59% of the entry-level workforce and 80% of the American consumer population.Your worth and potential is limitless -- but it&rsquo;s just hard to see, because of the vicious cycle of underrepresentation.
It&rsquo;s time to destroy the cycle of underrepresentation and show the world the truth. We believe that the female community is a powerful and invaluable tool in supporting and inspiring women to reach for more. She Did That is a platform to elevate women across the world by allowing them to learn about others&rsquo; achievements, to feel inspired, and to engage in one of the biggest worldwide movements.
