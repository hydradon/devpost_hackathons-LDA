                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mother is an oncologist. Much of my inspiration is from learning about what she does and how I can contribute.

                    Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is meant to be a method for a user to get a gage of whether a lesion can be potentially harmful or not. A user can upload a picture of a mole or another lesion and the algorithm can classify it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I definitely needed to learn about CNNs and how they work. At the start of this project, I was completely unfamiliar with neural networks and deep learning, so this experience opened up a completely new field for me. I also learned how to access different datasets and how to work with image data. Finally, I was able to upgrade from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2 and learn the differences between the two.
