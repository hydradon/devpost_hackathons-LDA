                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project was that all of our group members have family affected by one of these geriatric diseases. Although these diseases are uncurable, we wanted to find a way to enhance treatment and information to benefit the lives of those affected. We have seen first-hand the affects of these diseases and wanted to make a positive change to help not only our loved ones, but the millions of others with these diseases.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patient Empowerment is a 2-part tool for doctors: information and treatment. With information, it describes each disease with statistics, causes, side effects, etc. that patients can read up more about to gain a better understanding. The information puts all this information together in an easy-to-read format for these patients who tend to be aged (geriatrics) and may struggle with the complex medical wording of doctors and websites. Then with treatment, this is a supplemental treatment for doctors. For each one of these diseases (type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's), there is a treatment benefit. With Diabetes, patients can enter what they have eaten, their physical activity, and then their daily glucose levels. This data is then given back to the doctors so they can monitor diet and trends in health to better cater treatment. With Alzheimer's, the site provides mental stimulation game, a proven therapy to maximize their brain life.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio Code to build most of the website (html, css, etc.). We then registered our domain with Name Cheap and connected it to the Google Cloud Host to get the site running.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part was connecting the domain from NameCheap to Google Cloud hosting as the instructions were vague and not straightforward. We took a while to link the two and make all of our site public.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to get a functional site available to people everywhere. Although the site is not completely built out with all the functions we have envisioned, we are proud with the massive amount of progress we have made towards our goal.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of web development and cloud development as this was something we didn't have a lot of experience in the field.
