                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in creating a player vs. player game where we could inspire fun game play through competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a survival game where each player has a joystick-controlled base surrounded by a force field that is used to fend off incoming asteroids. The first player to have three asteroids bypass the force field and strike their base loses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two Arduinos to get values from two joysticks and then used Pyserial to move all this input data to Python. The game was then created using Pygame and graphics drawn on Medibang Paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to use Pyserial to obtain readable values from Arduino (which we were using to implement a joystick). It was also difficult to apply collision detections on a diagonally shaped object as well as deal with lagging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of the design and layout, the music, and the game&rsquo;s relative functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate between two Arduinos and Python using Pyserial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Royale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to reduce lag in the game.
