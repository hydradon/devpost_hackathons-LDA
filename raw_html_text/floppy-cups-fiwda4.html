                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found way too many floppy drives and upon remembering how useless they are, we decided to make an orchestra out of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays midi files out of floppy drives. Quite entertaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our electrical engineer built everything, whilst our software failed over and over again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High expectations, people wanting to hear the orchestra, and an unstable audio library for java.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music was made
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never again shall we try and use a library that is not well documented (...we say for the 3rd time)
                </p>
