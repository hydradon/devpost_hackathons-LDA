                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw the current smart locks that are available for sale and thought that they were cumbersome and dificult to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Kinect, the lock is able to take a picture of who is coming to the door and automatically unlock the door if the person is registered in the system. If not, the owner is alerted and can have a video call with whoever is at the door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Kinect SDK to program the Kinect to take a picture of the person at the door and send a request to a Nodejs server that processes the request and handles video chat and then sends the facial recognition data to a python service that will then match the picture to the registered users,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of technology that we tried to incorporate into the project but were not able to. For example, we tried to use a Qualcomm Dragonboard but we couldn't find a way to connect sensors to the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the face recognition and machine learning done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we needed to manage our time better. We spent too much time setting up the hardware which mean we had to rush the code to a certain extent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let Me In
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to make it more accurate by incorporating different technologies like a 3d depth scanner.
