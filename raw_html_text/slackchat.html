                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were heavily inspired by mIRC, the most popular and ubiquitous IRC client used, due to this there are a number of easter eggs hidden away for those who are familiar with certain easter eggs and commands.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to chat to your fellow colleagues, ideally, but currently it's only a public group chat.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The essential concepts and basis can be learned by following guides on how to use socket.io, building a simple chat application with it in express and MongoDB, from there it's customizing it to our scenario with much pain and effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first small hurdle we ran into was learning socket.io for the very first time, after half an hour it was clear how it worked, but then when it came to deployment on Heroku ports were being overloaded. After that and adding more features the next challenge was working our the express route flows, how to map sign in and sign up.

                    What's next for SlackChat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've reached a very MVP product with many small features, but next it will be the bigger ones, channels and private messaging users.
