                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few weeks ago I started learning about assembly and this idea for my project was inspired by that experience. 
I remember encountering difficulties in my debugging process for my programs and GDB, the existing popular debugger was intimidating to navigate as a beginner. I envisioned creating a debugger that would be more accessible and helpful for others who may be in my shoes and is just starting to become familiar with assembly and not completely comfortable with more advanced and complicated debuggers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project is a web application that allows users to simulate x86-64 assembly code in NASM syntax. It provides users with useful debugging information such as the registers and stack in real time. It also gives users the option to go through the code instructions line by line. Additionally this application is beneficial for those who are looking for a visual representation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The foundation of this project was the virtual machine, which provided the essential feature that parsed through x86-64 assembly code and simulated it. This was written in Go. The results were sent to the client side through a web socket.
