                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   While Brianna was in her engineering class, where she uses Ohm's law quite often, she realized that she wanted a shortcut for all the math she was doing. All three members of the group wished for a way to complete math homework and classwork with more ease, something that removed time spent imputing equations into a calculator. The idea for a calculator just for Ohm's law developed into a calculator for any sort of equation, whether it's a chemistry formula, or an algebra formula.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    Formuladd is a calculator for equations. Instead of typing in an entire formula, you can just put in what all the variables but one equal, and then get what the remaining variable is equivalent to. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    Formuladd was programmed using the language visual basic on Microsoft visual studio. The icon was created using blender and source film maker. The artwork was created using a drawing programm called Krita with the use of a Wacom intuos pro tablet. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   A challenge that was ran into was for the first five hours of the competition, we weren't able to get the number inputted, which is a String, converted to a Double, so we would be able to do all the math. We eventually figured it out, and after that, it was a breeze. Another small problem was small math errors, such as forgetting that c in the Pythagorean theorem is equal to the square root of a squared plus b squared, not just a squared plus b squared. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of ##
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    A few accomplishments we're proud of is our logo, and the program itself. We think the icon for Formuladd looks like something you could truly find in an app store, and the programming got a lot accomplished in 24 hours. It's quick, efficient, and effective, but at the same time, a simplistic idea. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   We learned a lot from this competition, and while creating this program. Our main programmer, Chris, learned that you can find the square root of numbers in visual basic using Math.sqrt(), and also learned of other things, such as the existence of Math.PI, and that to square variables you can write a^2 instead of (a * a). Brianna learned the basics of Visual Basics, and how to unite coding and math through that language. Kaela learned a lot more about a new programming language, Visual Basic, and applied her knowledge of Java to help her. She also learned new things about a drawing program called Krita, such as how to invert selections.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    We hope to add a lot more formulas that we didn't get a chance to add in, such as chemistry kinematics equations, derivatives, and resistivity in physics.
