                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing a loved one become addicted to a f*cking Scrabble knockoff. The addictive elements added and not understanding what was going on when put away months of family time and life to play the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches people what video games are including to addict you by having the user follow an interactive story of adding addictive elements to a game they are developing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unreal Engine 4 and Hackathon food
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bugs in the engine, rewriting the game a few times for feature creep
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having it work at the end!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained experience in Unreal Engine 4, learned a lot about loops and logic, and am better prepared to deal with feature creep by making it right in the first place. Also became up-to-date on uploading to the Android marketplace.

                    What's next for E-dicted (Electronics Addicted)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better writing, a longer story, and more information and tricks scrupulous developers add, but first putting the HTML5 version on Blouir.com and releasing on the Android and iOS marketplaces.
