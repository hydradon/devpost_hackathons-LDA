                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When was the last time you checked your voicemail? It&rsquo;s been awhile huh? Well, you are not alone. A recent survey by eVoice, a provider of virtual phone services, found that only 33 percent of people listen to voice mail from business contacts. Only 18 percent listen to voicemails from numbers they don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, sometimes voicemails can be very important. For diabetics, it is crucial for them to be informed when their insulin prescriptions are refilled and ready for pickup. People are so busy now a days that they often miss the calls and unknowingly ignore their voicemails from their doctors, dentists, and pharmacies. Woxi allows our users to rest assured as their voicemails are no longer neglected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Woxi is an android app that efficiently runs in the background and analyzes your voicemails to create smart reminders and calendar events. If your doctor&rsquo;s office leaves you a voicemail asking you to schedule a follow up appointment, Woxi automatically creates a tentative calendar event integrated with smart reminders strategically placed in free time-slots in your busy schedule. The tentative event is confirmed using our seamless Facebook messenger chat bot. Woxi works around you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be wonder : &ldquo;Will Woxi make random events when random people leave voice mails?&rdquo; The answer is NO. Woxi recognizes and doesn&rsquo;t act on spam voicemails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Native Android app built with android studio. Version control with GitHub. We used IBM Watson&rsquo;s Speech-to-Text for converting the voicemail speech into data that we can analyze. Key word analysis with related words. We used Google Calendar API to create Woxi&rsquo;s smart reminder skill. Facebook messenger Chatbot is built with Facebook Graph API, Heroku, and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became very close with IBM&rsquo;s team at this hackathon. We had a hard time initially integrating Watson&rsquo;s Speech-to-Text service, but with their help, we were able to it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our voicemail keyword algorithm used to create Google calendar events with a title, description, location, dates, and smart reminders. The smart reminders sets calendar notifications based on your schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with IBM Watson and the Facebook Graph API. We had a fun time learning these developer tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Woxi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Woxi is currently tackling a small part, voicemail optimization, of a potentially huge cognitive smartphone assistant app used to automate tasks. In the short term, we want to expand our keyword algorithm to incorporate business scenarios. Woxi as an artificially intelligent secretary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to utilize Watson's Retrieve and Rank service to improve our keyword algorithm and smart reminder feature using machine learning. Woxi will be able to learn from each voicemail you get and make more detailed and elegant calendar events.
