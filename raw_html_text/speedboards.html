                    The keyboard is one of most frequently used tools on our planet!
This makes they keyboard the perfect target for innovation and improvement.

                    To understand the future one must understand the past.
As mobile keyboards have evolved, a trend jumps out.

                <p>
                    Back in the days of the Nokia brick, typing a single character required several key presses. As technology progressed full, qwerty keyboards emerged requiring only one touch per character. Then came what was, until now, the current generation: swipe keyboards. A whole word squeezed into a single touch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It became obvious that the next step was a zero-touch keyboard!

                <h3>
                    ComboBoard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The major limitation of both qwerty and swipe keyboards is the amount of movement and accuracy required. It severely limits the speed at which a user can produce their message, which as a service which all of us use several times a day incurs a huge cost in the long run. To combat this we've developed ComboBoard, a keyboard which generates input based on the combination of buttons pressed which means the number of keys and therefore finger movement is drastically brought down.

                    Both keyboards can be used as the default input source, replacing the obsoleted keyboards currently shipped with Android!
