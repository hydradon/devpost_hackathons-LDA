                    It's a game system that uses

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the arduino in combination with the Grove Shield and LCD to create a system that measures the capacitance in
                    <em>
                        mangos
                    </em>
                    and reads for changes from touch.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were a bit stuck up on some hardware issues, the LCD's didn't function as expected and led to problems we couldn't fix. We also had a redesign for the end product a few times and had to rewrite the code several times over. Materials for a physical system were scarce so we tried our best to scrap what we could for use.

                    Keeping away from the tempting

                    </em>
                    proved the most challenging.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating Mangos as a core piece of the project and not an accessory.
Completing a more hardware oriented hack this time.
Having fun.

                <p>
                    Better looking containers and better displays for the game.
More accurate sensors to construct.
