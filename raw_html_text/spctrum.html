                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming ideas for our project by listing issues that we face on a daily basis, as well as listing challenges people with various types of disabilities face. While loudly discussing our issues and ideas, a member from a different team at the table across from us interjected and mentioned that he was colorblind, which got us thinking. This led to the creation of sPCtrum, an app made to help people with colorblindness in their everyday lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our demo app allows the user to input an image by either uploading an existing photo or by taking a photo on the spot. The app then filters the image to make it easier for people with Deuteranomaly, a type of red-green colorblindness, to see the color green. Our demo app currently only have the option of assisting people with Deuteranomaly, but we hope to expand the line of filters to suit the needs for all types of colorblindness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was developed in Android Studio and we utilised the OpenCV Java libraries to help with the image processing portion of our project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of first time hackers, we were all very apprehensive about this hackathon. Our limited skills seemed to limit our ideas, but in the end we looked to the internet to teach us the skills to make this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing a project at our first hackathon! We went into this hackathon with not many expectations- we would be surprised if we even built anything at all. We are proud of our collaboration skills to create a functional app that has both user friendly UI but also looks great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned previously, we learned a lot of skills from the internet at this hackathon. For many of us, it was our first time building an app in general, and it was very cool that we were able to learn and build one in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sPCtrum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are big plans for sPCtrum, as we truly think this app can become a tool that makes accessibility for people with disabilities convenient. Improvements such as a real time camera feed that corrects images in real time, options for multiple filters and customize personal filters, and a cloud where users can share their own filters and leave reviews, so many ways sPCtrum can improve and we hope that these updates can be implemented when there are less time constraints.
