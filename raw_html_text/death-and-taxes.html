                    Canonical "hard problems" in computer science can often seem very simple at the outset, like the traveling salesman problem or whether P==NP. True to form, a contemporary problem in computer science has snuck up on us in recent years, as the growth of technology firms involved in the development and proliferation of digital technologies has been correlated with a paralyzing, exponentially growing, and seemingly essential and inextricable inability on the part of these firms to pay their taxes.

                    Like all "hard problems" in computer science, however, we can accept our current limitations, find the "least bad" option in front of us, and power through the boundaries of our knowledge, illusory though they may prove to be in the future. We aim to show that virtual reality technologies are not just for fun, leveraging the absolute bleeding edge of extant virtual reality technologies represented by the OCULUS RIFT virtual reality headset to bring the full disruptive potential of gamification into the realm of personal taxes. When paired with a state of the art four-channel MUSE electroencephalography unit for neurofeedback, we close the control loop on the player's tax returns using a bio-inspired adaptive algorithmic approach to modulate the player's inputs. Much like the cerebral cortex talks to the thalamus, or the way our javascript message parser talks to the MUSE unit, we show that nobody can be overwhelmed by a deluge of information if they just throw 90% of it away.
