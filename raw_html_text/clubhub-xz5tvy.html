                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All members of our group are involved with clubs from our respective schools, and we all noticed a plethora of communication errors, lack of organization and lack of transparency between students, club managers and Universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a platform that solves all of these issues, while also empowering students and club organizers with tools that promote synergy between both parts. Our platform includes club member analytics, personal calendars and the option to synchronize them with others, follow/unfollow mechanics, mass-communication tools and much more, effectively solving a problem present nationwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an online platform designed specifically for club organizers and students. Upon registration, students provide their .edu and get automatically assigned to a respective University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Club also gets a page of their own, where they can post announcements, create events and manage their members. Club Managers have access to a robust set of tools to manage their club - like custom analytics of their member base and the ability to send mass e-mails to all followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students can easily discover and follow clubs by browsing through their University's ClubHub pages. Following a club automatically updates your personal calendar with all of the club's events, and we've also created systems that allow you to easily add your class schedule to your personal calendar as well. Furthermore, you can synchronize your calendar with your friends to see what time slots you and your friends are free so that you can easily find activities that you and your friends can do together.  In the future, calendars can be synced up with other services like Google Calendar so students are always up to speed on what their Clubs are doing, and students can also use the Newsfeed to see the latest combined updates from all their clubs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By creating this free open platform, we hope to provide clubs with powerful tools for recruitment, management and communication with their members, while also empowering individual users by filling in the communication gaps that currently exist with effective organizational tools. We also believe that the public nature of the club pages and events also increases transparency between these organizations and the University they're in, so all parties can be fully aware of what's being done and where.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end of our project using the Bootstrap framework and the back-end using Node.JS/Express.JS. We used Postgresql to design the database and stitched all of the parts together with sugar, adrenaline and force of will.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a very ambitious project - nothing less than a full platform to be used by students nationwide. Turning this huge undertaking into small achievable goals was our biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a strong concept that solves real problems within the CUNY landscape and beyond. ClubHub is visually refined and feature rich, showing a deep understanding of the issues surrounding students, club members and club managers across the country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working on big projects like this in the span of 24 hours can be draining, it's always worth it if it's a problem you care about solving. We also learned a little bit about all of the technologies we using within our project, as well as how to keep a +24 hour sprint like this organized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ClubHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monetize our platform so it can be truly self-sustaining. We plan doing this in four ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integrate Trelio so Club Managers can send text messages to all of their members for a small fee (or unlimited access for a monthly subscription).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create individual event pages and allow club managers to sell tickets on our platform (for a small convenience fee, or no fee for a monthly subscription)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a job-ad based business model, connecting students to internships based on their student profile and types of clubs they engage with.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Expand the analytics portion of our app, which can be accessed only by club managers who pay a monthly subscription.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We also want to allow club managers to send out mass e-mails to their followers using the MailChimp API instead of an isolated script, giving them the ability to deeply customize their messages and gather even more analytical data (like the percentage of members who opened them).
