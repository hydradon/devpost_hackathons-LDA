                        Great things.
                    </strong>
                    Selling a book:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On creating an account, a user can post a listing for a book they want to sell just by entering the ISBN number, selling price, binding-type
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our App scrapes an ISBN search website and gets details about the book (author, title)  to display on the listings page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While posting a listing, the user can opt to add course information along with the book - by selecting the department (Georgia Tech) from a pre-populated drop-down list and entering the course number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This would enable prospective buyers to search for required textbooks based on the course.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Buying a book:

                    <li>
                        If a User wants to buy a book, they can make a request for the book listed at a certain price by the seller
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The seller can then view these requests and decide which buyer he/she would like to contact in order to discuss exchange

                    <strong>
                        Android Studio, Python scripts, Java
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Our main app is an Android App which we created using Android Studio
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We wrote python and java scripts to pull data off the web - ISBN data, course data from gatech department + course listings
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firebase didn't connect with Android Studio, so we had to decide to temporarily use local storage (with no persistence) until we can find time to set up the database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Under pressure, we had to create a facade that maintains references to the classes and maintains multiple static lists to store data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We initially tried to incorporate a python script we wrote to scrape the web to get book details like author, title from a website by searching using the ISBN. However, Android Studio didn't work with it, so we had to rewrite the script in Java.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That script also didn't work because Android Studio doesn't let you access the Internet during the execution of an Activity. We had to create a separate Thread to run the script as a background process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
