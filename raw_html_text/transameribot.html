                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw this was a category/prize, we had never built a bot, so we wanted to change that
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the basic level, it can answer questions about what TransAmerica does, what they sell, and they can put you in touch with a human.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use api.ai for the language processing and traversing the FSM we made, coupled with a node.js backend to send emails when a user requests a contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never designed for voice before... There's a LOT to learn about smooth interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Google Home simulator can't deal with latency. AT ALL
                </p>
                <p>
                    Api.al can take a lot of getting used to as it's a finite state machine generator that uses AI to accept fuzzy inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot we built can be deployed to Google Home, Alexa, Cortana, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Telegram, SMS and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We already have the bot running on Telegram (@TransAmeribot)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build a natural language processing bot, how to use webhooks, how to deal with ambiguity and come out ahead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TransAmeribot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could add more information, and perhaps connect it to a CRM system for lead generation.
                </p>

                    This is a Google Home submission. While you can interact with the bot over text using the link below, for a Google Home demo please ask Logan.
