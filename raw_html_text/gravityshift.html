                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4 highly creative students gathered around to create the next generation of gravity themed space games: GravityShift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered what the equivalent of car racing in space is? 
If not, we are going to show you anyways. 
In GravityShift you can experience gravity while challenging your friends to your best space game ever created in 20 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is created using Unity and all its design is made by us using Illustrator and Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us it was either the first or second time working in Unity, yet we still encounter difficulties while setting up the movement of the character/objects/background etc. 
However since it is a gravity themed 2d game, the newest challenge we've ran into was definitely the physics integration. It required a lot of research and prior knowledge in physics that was impossible to cover using only Youtube tutorials. 
It was the first time to design a multi player game in Unity while turned out to be a bit tricky, but there is nothing that can't be done by us :). 
The design of the game required a lot of patience and meticulousness, since all the spaceships were created using normal shapes and gradients. Also, the planets and backgrounds were designed using Photoshop, because we wanted to make a project that is 100% ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is the first time to work in Illustrator and to create a multi player game with a proper physics engine.
