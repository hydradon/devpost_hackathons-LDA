                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to prevent cyber bulling in general
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blocks Tweets which are deemed as being offessive to a user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a server running a Python script that detects faul tweets and either blocks it or allows it to be seen/visible to the user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything about the project was challenging since we wrote our own LAD from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we managed to accomplish what we set out to do is enough reason for us to be proud of it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NEVER try writing our own LAD with less than 12 hours left
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clique
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend it just beyond Twitter. The plan is to have it working in other social media platforms
                </p>
