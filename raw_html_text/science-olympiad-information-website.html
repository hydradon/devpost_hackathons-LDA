                    As members of the Science Olympiad Team of SBHS, we decided that publicity was important to our club to increase attendance. Therefore, we decided to make this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has information pertaining to our team and how you can reach us if you need to or have any questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to create our website, and used JavaScript for some features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had some issues with the CSS and it didn't look right a lot of times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to create a moving picture slideshow on the homepage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned that while coding something may seem easy or shallow, it's no simple task and takes a lot of careful effort and time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will try to get a domain for our website, and we will also add more information and features, such as competition history.
