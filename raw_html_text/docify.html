                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roberto was travelling in Brazil when he was feeling unwell and he went to a doctor. The doctor was new and did not have his medical records and so was unable to find the cause of his ill health immediately. We discussed this and realized that it is true for other parts of the world as well. There is no central database of data that can be easily accessed by a range of different doctors. And so, came the start of Docify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Docify builds a central database for people's medical records and provides them with a QR code to access it. People can keep the QR code in their pocket or wallet and in times of emergencies, doctors can simply scan the QR code to immediately find out important on-demand info about the patient. This reduces the need for hard copies of medical records and modernizes a relatively archaic document storage system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby-on-Rails to build the backend components of the app with React-Native for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took longer than expected for many tasks. It's a big application to build with technologies that we had never used before (like React-Native). Learning those completely new concepts first and then implementing them was quite a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implementing the QR scanner was quite a challenge
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setting up the central medical database was another nice accomplishment
## What we learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When trying new things don't underestimate the time it would take. And when using new technologies, we learned the importance of testing and playing around with them to get a good sense of their abilities.
## What's next for Docify
Adding more features like-
Add information for fields other than just medical records
Decentralize it using technologies like Blockchain
Implement a higher level of security to maintain data privacy and protection
