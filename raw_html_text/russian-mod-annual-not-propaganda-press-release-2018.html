                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainstream news outlets seem to exaggerate many facts about Russian military this and Russian military that to legendary boogeyman levels, even more so than the Russian Ministry of Defense itself. I decided to correct these misperceptions in a fun and engaging manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website highlights various instances of over-exaggeration of new technologies by the Russian military over the past several decades, as well as the truth about said technologies, which, while not nearly as embellished as in the Russian Ministry of Defense's press releases, are nonetheless equally interesting.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a standard HTML5/CSS3/JS page; novice-level programming at best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A) Several instances of misnamed variables - it took several frustrating hours of bugfixing to deduce the source of the problem.
B) Writing in broken English like a true Russian is difficult without at least three glasses of Stolichnaya.
C) Trying to format the page in CSS so it looks identical across multiple different resolutions was an indescribably frustrating and, in hindsight, somewhat pointless endeavour. Adjusting the spacing for one element would often wreck the alignment of
                    <strong>
                        every single other element on the webpage
                    </strong>
                    - this often took 30 minutes or more to remedy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CSS formatting described above, though frustrating, did eventually pay off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSS formatting is an absolute pain in the rear and should not be attempted unless one has an unlimited supply of antidepressants and time for bugfixing.
