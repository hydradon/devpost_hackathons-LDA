                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app as we ourselves are becoming adults and several "adulting" things, such as paying taxes and changing our cars oil seems super difficult, and a google search just seems to throw a lot of words at us that don't make sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we created a hub for people starting out on their own, to learn how to cook, change their oil, and file taxes. We've included widgets for things like figuring out a rental budget and figuring out how much to tip on a meal. We've included tutorials and links to outside resources to expand our users ability to gather information to make themselves successful adults!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The original template was taken from Bootstrap and then further modified for our uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea included an authorization problem, and around midnight we came to the conclusion that we could not fix that authorization issue ourselves. We had to reconvene and work around the issue to come up with a new idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite coming up with an idea late in the game, we finished on time and have a website we are proud of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that for our next hackathon, we will look further into the tools needed to bring our ideas to life and learn about certain procedures, such as OAuth, beforehand.
                </p>

                    What's next for Adulting 101
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will expand Adulting 101's library of helpful information and include more tutorials, widgets, and information!
