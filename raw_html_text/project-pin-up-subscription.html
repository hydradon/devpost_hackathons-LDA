                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always have struggle with maintaining our budgeting with just our bank app and sometime we even forget about subscriptions we have made. We thought it would be great if it was all in one app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Track subscription spending as well as regular purchases through bank statements. If anything is paid by cash you can manually add it. There is also a budgeting portion that has your personal monthly spending to help track your budgeting.
