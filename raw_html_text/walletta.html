                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Hi, I am Zahra, the creator of this service and I love traveling. I can't even count the amount of cash I have lost, got stolen, got robbed or washed away. Every time I had to carry a hefty amount of cash, I would always be paranoid about getting it either stolen or getting stood up at a gunpoint. After a major incident in 2016 of me getting robbed on a trip abroad, I decided to actively work on getting a solution for this problem and the goal of Walletta is to make sure their customers always have a safe and secure way to access their finances at any desired time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a back-end service that partners up with businesses to provide their customers with a safe way to carry cash around, especially when traveling abroad. We have developed this platform by combining three databases in Python that uses flasks and connectors to convert that data into SQL and test it out using REST APIs. The customer can convert their US dollars into a foreign currency before their trip to avoid any hassle of converting it later. The customer has the ability to find out the exchange rate for the day of that currency. Once they convert their currency, it gets stored in a temporary e-wallet to separate the transaction data between both currencies. The customer has easy access to their transaction data on a daily basis and can convert currency on the go. The goal is to deliver a "cashless wallet" that can create an eco-friendly environment while providing a secure way to carry cash around.
