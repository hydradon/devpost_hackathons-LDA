                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something cool.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Essentially, iHome is a smart surveillance system that helps you know who it at your home away from home.  It sends you a notification to your phone about who is at home.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Together with my patner, we split up that tasks.  I took care of the hardware and casing of the Jetson, while he took on the software, configuring and programming the necessary

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we encountered was getting it to work, from setting up the Nvidia Jetson TX2 to running TensorFlow on it.  It was a challenge just to get it set up.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so happy that our project just works!  We did not have high expectations coming in and starting of this morning, but nonetheless, we pushed through to create a project that we are proud of.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time attending a make-a-thon, and it was a wonderful experience to work with my hands to create the casing for the project.  For my partner, and experienced hacker, it was his first time working with the Nvidia Jetson, and it was a great learning experience for him to configure tensorflow to run on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iHome
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we envision it to detect a lot more scenarios, and detecting familiar faces is just the start.  For instance, we want to set this up as an IP Camera and make it more smart.
