                    What does it do?

                <p>
                    With an Arduino Uno, a Sunfounder sound chip, and an ESP8266 we created the hardware functionality of our project. It works in three phases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It listens with the highly sensitive sound chip
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It sends the voltage readings through the Arduino and the ESP8266 to our online Firebase relational database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, that information will be picked up by our iOS app, displayed in a functional and clear manner, and a user can submit their complaints about other rooms around them
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon all four of us journeyed into our first hardware experience! None of us have really worked with boards before, which was such a thrill to explore. We started by thinking about the problem of noise and how unaware we can be of it, and then developed the hardware/software from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges &amp; Accomplishments!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once again, learning new tech was a real challenge for us. In addition, we had minimal Swift experience before this hackathon, but we were dedicated to our IoT hybrid solution. Overcoming this challenge has helped us achieve great personal accomplishments. Three of our four members have never been to hackathons before, so getting to gain this experience was a thrilling time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The valuable skills of hardware, Firebase, and Swift will be a great asset in our future. These are languages we don't experience often in our normal coursework, so getting to try something new with mentorship meant a lot to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have a lot of ideas for the future to improve this solution! Listed below are our main goals:
