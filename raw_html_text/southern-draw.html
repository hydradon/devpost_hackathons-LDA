                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like games such as Pictionary and wanted to explore a multiplatform game using multiple technologies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you and a friend to draw on your iOS devices and have your drawings displayed on a browser, the goal is to have the other player guess what you are drawing. You are given a room code when you get into a browser you are given a room code and after two players connect you are both given a prompt and your drawings are live streamed to the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift 4 and iOS for the drawing client. React with typescript for the web client, and python flask for the back end, using Socket.io for communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting socket communication going for iOS to Flask as well as mapping points from different sized devices to a single sized react window. The overall structure of the communication was also difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are very proud to have built a multiplatform experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to communicate using Socket.io. As well as flask server architecture better.
