                    What Inspired Us!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While applying to any office, the citizen is required to produce a bunch of photocopies of all necessary documents as a necessity. This stands as the most tedious task for the application, since many users are not aware of what documents are required, and they have to make multiple visits to the facility in the process of completing the supporting documents, thereby causing process delay. A more cumbersome case is to carry all the original documents to get photocopies of required documents at the spot, which is prone to losing your documents too. Similar is the case about your passport sized pictures required everywhere again and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In another scenario, a person is away from home and requires a copy of all the documents to submit an application at certain organization. This can be very problematic since he/she does not have all the documents at that time and is unable to apply. Another scenario is when a VISA Consultant requires a copy of passport in order to submit a person&rsquo;s application. If the person is out of city, he/she is unable to deliver the copy, thus, causing the process to a halt. These kinds of situations are faced by almost everyone in daily life. Be it a student or a professional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carrying original documents at various places either as a proof or for the purpose of photocopy is also dreary in case the documents get missed due to some means. In case an original document gets missings, it is required to submit a formal application and to physically visit the awarding institute in some particular city and get the original document. This gets very hectic and many people then opt not to go for the original document at all.

                    What the project offers

                <p>
                    eKaghzat is an online web portal which enables anyone to put all the documents over the internet in the digital form, to avoid carrying the photocopies of them everywhere. Be it the CNIC, Driving License, official documents or education documents, one can place it over eKaghzat portal to have anywhere availability. eKaghzat does not restrict the user upon the number and type of documents uploaded. The portal also offers the facility to download the digital form of the document by any authorized office/person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    to the application office to download the digital form of the user document via the portal. User can also give permission to any other person. As some of the documents are confidential, eKaghzat Team have devised a mechanism to enable the access on permission. This will be done via giving a timed access of the only particular document on request.
                </p>

                <p>
                    User registers at the portal
Upload the image of documents with proper naming convention
For Document Sharing:
Send an SMS at the Number for the document required
The system will send an access code via SMS
The user will give the code to the awaited official/party
The awaited official/party will open the portal and enter CNIC (unique identifier) and access code 
Get timed access to the document link

                <h2>
                    What's next for eKaghzat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way forward is to engage a governing body to authorize the documents so these can be considered as original. In case a person loses any document's hard copy, he/she need not to go back to the city to get the original. The document present at eKaghzat portal should suffice the need. This can be done if the governing body scans the document at their center or approves it as authentic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    eKaghzat also intends to engage HEC in order to provide online attestation service. We also intend to engage other attestation bodies to engage for the attestation and authentication purposes.
