                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are designing a board game of our own, and we needed an API to develop and test our game. Our project provides tools to not only test our game but any tabletop game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our API provides a base set of mechanics, systems, and statistics needed to analyze tabletop games. This API can be implemented in a variety of projects to simulate game mechanics and allow for the easy implementation of a turn by turn statistical analysis of a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing everything from scratch while maintaining the abstractness needed for our API to be implemented into almost any game without placing too many constraints on the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing every aspect of our API into four radically different tabletop games ranging from blackjack to war to shut the box to UNO!.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of writing code that kept the right level of abstraction while ensuring concrete methods still exist. Also, this presented one of the few opportunities to program in a collaborative setting which was critical to designing such a large API. Additionally, this was my first exposure to GitHub, and it was extremely useful for utilizing the value of this type of software.
