We think that the first step we might take toward greater sustainability is to raise people&rsquo;s awareness and knowledge of the subject matter. Mayor Badman is designed and created to serve those ends.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Research supported game. We did tons of researches to support the logic behind our game. Each run we calculate up to 14 types of environmental challenges and pollutions. 
The game is engaging. One can comprehend the game in a second, yet it takes him time to master it. 
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    It is challenging yet rewarding for a player to discover how industrial growth, agricultural expansion, and policies can result in different environmental outcomes. 
    The game serves as a medium to raise people&rsquo;s awareness of pollutions of all varieties. As we believe that being aware of the issues is already a great step toward resolution.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>In the game, you can build houses, farms and industries with different costs on grassland. Each of them has different influences upon the food, gold(economy), and merchandise. If one of those factors runs out, you will lose. You cannot build on river, trees, and edges.
