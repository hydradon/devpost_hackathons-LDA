                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game's concept is based on the brainstroming session on 16-Dec-2017 from students from grade 9 to 11 who are interested in developing their programming skills and learn more about this emerging technology, i.e. voice control interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game concept is simple. As a typical high school student, there are many conflicting priorites such as school, social activities and part-time work, and this game is to challenge high school students on how handle those priorities with limit free time outside school.

                <p>
                    Different events (e.g. computer science project) requires different hours and each time it's requirement is randomized, not unlike real life. And the summary is based on the number of hours you put to different priorities.
