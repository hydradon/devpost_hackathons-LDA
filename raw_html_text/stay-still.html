                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a 3D model of a room to try and see how art would look on a wall or how a sculpture would look in a space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a series of depth images to create a 3D map of the environment by combining all of the depth images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Intel RealSense camera to take the depth images, model them using PointCloud, and combing the PointClouds into a single environment recreation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build a robot to take the images, but we were having issues with the serial controls. We also were trying to implement the project in VR but we ran into difficulties with color and exporting a .ply file into a VR environment.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully create a 3D model.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about 3D modeling methodologies.

                    To complete the project and implement the 3D model in a VR environment.
