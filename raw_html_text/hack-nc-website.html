                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the website was inspired by my previous website as I was really into web development when I was younger so it was fun to get back into doing things like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a kind of portfolio for me and my two other squad mates to be able to build their profile and add onto it if needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used html and css to both code the website and design it to match school colors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problems I ran into weren't many except for when we exported the projects that were made on separate devices and they would not open on the main website. I've tried working with them but the errors still occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to design a somewhat decent website in less than 2 hours and helped my teammates with the other parts of the projects that we have at the end of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That is may take more than just persistence to make a great project but you must try everything, no matter how simple it it when you encounter a problem.
                </p>
