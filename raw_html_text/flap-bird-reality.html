                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn Unity for VR. A game is the logical step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is similar to the game flappy bird but you have to flap the controllers like wings and then you fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to create the game and then added it to an Oculus to run it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is horribly intuitive. On-top of that we ran into multiple computer issues from a computer dying to segmentation faults. Unity is really difficult to learn but we over came it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working game in a very short amount of time with a technology we didn't know
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Unity, more in depth C#, and how to build a game.
                </p>
