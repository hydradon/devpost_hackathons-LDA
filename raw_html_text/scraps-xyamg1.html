                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of young software developers and aspiring software engineers, we push our limits by entering competitions, and hackathons. LA Hacks is a very popular and a very well put together competition that we were excited to participate in. We are excited about the application that we were able to push it out in less than 48 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraps is an application that allows users to post pictures of any trash that they might see as a concern to their city. After, the photo that they posted will also send their location to our app and will then appear on a heat map so that people in the area can be aware of the state of their city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Laravel, Python, Vue.js, Vue-x, single page web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Permissions, deployment, not having access to our api's in flask, trouble with being able to use google machine learning vision, Wi-Fi, trouble with geolocation on google maps, and just being sleepy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to communicate clearly with each other, always being on the same page, the ability of putting up with each other for the whole weekend, implementing google map, google ml vision on dev, and each other's hard work and time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a lot of industry knowledge that we would not get from a class room. We learned how to work with people, time management, and knowing when go with the easier approach rather than the better approach.
                </p>
