                    Bot-Friend is an Amazon Alexa social skill programmed with Python. We started off on a different plan for the project. We wanted to create just a website that allows people with similar tragic experiences to connect to each other and give support. From there we branched off into taking a simple Discord Bot that a team member had created previously and thought of implementing it with Amazon Alexa to give a deeper conversation focused on how the individual feels. We had to formulate a behavior pattern for the bot to then know what the Alexa version will be doing. We ran by the slogan "a little bot that makes you feel better" as a mental map for this adventure. Our Bot-Friend attempts to carry a more emotional conversation where it does not refer you away in a singe long response as shown by the preset Alexa skills. It takes more interest in how the use feel. 
    We created the program for Bot-Friend through three platforms. Alexa Developer Console, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda, and Python on Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. Alexa has to be configured with intents and utterances to respond properly. Combining these tools in the Alexa Developer Console with the Python code saved in AWS Lambda allows Alexa to run properly.
                    <br>
                    We ran into many issues regarding the communication between Alexa, the Alexa Developer Tools, and AWS Lambda. We did not understand how these services worked together for quite some time during the event. Once we were able to pass that, we came across Alexa not recognizing the skill we made specific to our project. It ended up being an account issue that left after a few hours. 
    Bot-Friend has the capability to really expand Alexa's abilities with conversations regarding emotions that the known social bots cannot do due to there struct use in the individual's interest.
