                    Staying home with our grandparents, we learned that keeping track of their medication was priority. As well as them being truthful to taking it. The application sets a fixed alarm when to take your medication. The user must check that they have taken their medication. Using Android Studio gave us many issues along the way. The database we programmed with SQLite was not able to hold types of medication only the username and password. For the sake of coherence in the app, we no longer needed the database. Constructing the alarm also did not process within our app. Although many challenges came our way, we continued to reprogram and make the best of our idea come to life. There were many helpful hackers who encouraged us to persevere. With that, we will continue to work on the application outside of this HackaThon and prepare a (much) better version of it. In terms of coding, we learned about constructors and how to use AndroidStudio as a whole. We also made our very first Database. This was an exciting experience and a very enlightening one as well.
