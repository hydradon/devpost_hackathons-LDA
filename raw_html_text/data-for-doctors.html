                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool to help the community and assist people in finding healthcare resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides clearer data using data analytics to doctors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data has been analyzed using Python, and the website was built using HTML/CSS/Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data analyses was often difficult due to inaccuracies, and the UI techniques used to build the website are not commonly seen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of implementing the UI techniques like parallax scrolling in our website, improving the accuracy of our models, and displaying the data in a clean way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new techniques for managing data and new UI techniques. We also learned Django in order to create a backend that could handle the interactive parts of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Data for Doctors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will contact doctors and policymakers to advocate for further improvement of our community.
                </p>
