                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Lightning Network is an amazing new technology that I watched blossom from an idea to main net. I decided that I wanted to participate in this historical project by running my own full node. However, my laptop's storage capacity was insufficient. So, I went out to pick up an external drive and figured out how to store the blockchain there so I could make my first lightning purchase.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a guide on how to setup a full btcd/LND node on a Mac with an external SSD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I put together btcd and LND documentation and laid out the steps from start to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not extremely open source savy, so being able to put together multiple sources of documentation into one cohesive guide was pretty difficult for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Purchasing a Blockstream, "I Got Lightning Working" sticker via the lncli. Now I can put it on my laptop as a badge of honor.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to run a full bitcoin node with lightning on top. I learned how to create a wallet, fund it, and open a channel on the main network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How to Build a btcd/LND Full Node on OSX (w/external SSD)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to extend it to all the other operating systems so this will provide as a useful guide to bootstrap Bitcoin/Lightning enthusiasts.
