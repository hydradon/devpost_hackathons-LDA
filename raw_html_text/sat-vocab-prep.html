                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teams inspiration came from one of our group members, Danya Baron, who was complaining about all the SAT vocabulary she had to learn in order to take the take the SAT test in October. While brainstorming about project ideas, the idea of helping other kids going through the same thing Danya was currently experiencing, and thats when the idea was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our SAT vocabulary preparation web application is meant to help students taking the SAT test memorize more vocabulary words in clever ways. When tested, Danya said she remembered words more, including abhor, which means hate or extreme dislike, and bigot, which means an extremely close minded person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using HTML, Javascript, CSS, jQuery, and JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to get sentences for every single word of all 5001 SAT vocabulary words we had, so we had to learn the different processes needed to scrape the sentences and add them in proper format in our line of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much we were able to accomplish in the limited time we were given. We all learned a lot about coding and programming, and the capabilities we have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program and code a website application, and added lots of SAT words for people to learn. We learned new languages and new tips and techniques for coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SAT Vocab Prep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand our amount of words, and make mini quizzes for the students to test their knowledge. If we had more time, we could develop our web application further and include more features that would differentiate our creation from others.
