                <p>
                    What if nurses and hospital staff could handle twice the amount of patients with a fraction of the effort?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if hospital equipment were smarter, and could learn?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if instead of hospital equipment slowly aging into obsolescence because of the costs, they could update themselves with the latest discoveries as they trickle down from research to medical practices?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if even medical equipment became so inexpensive that remote hospitals, clinics and even police and fire staff had all the latest equipment and technology, right at their fingertips?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if the poorest remote hospitals suddenly had the same, if not more expertise and insights as the loftiest research hospitals?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if even a lone police officer, kneeling alone, beside a dying victim suddenly had access to the most recent life saving insights, turning a tragedy into a rescue?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if a cloud company, could step in and disrupt a "slow-to-change" industry, from top to bottom. from researchers all the way down through doctors, nurses, medical staff, emergency response, patients, and all the way down to the victim lying in the street, with only a lone police officer kneeling next to her.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    A Stretch?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know how you feel, we felt the same way until we realized, that a simple shift in thinking could disrupt an entire industry, from top to bottom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What She Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Florence serves as a real-time extra set of eyes and ears for already overworked nurses and hospital staff.
Every day, and every minute of every day, valuable data is being collected, and thrown away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By moving analysis to the cloud, researchers and physicians have access to data not just of the patient, but in aggregate. The data is collected in a standardized way so it is meaningful not only to the physician and patient, but also for researchers. This way researchers and physicians can learn from the data, and since the analysis is cloud based, the alerting and analysis can be continuously updated with new insights and discoveries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, our case study and first approach is with infants and Neonatal ICU. As the data is collected, researchers can discover new insights, and change the algorithms for alerting and pattern matching. For instance, particular breathing patterns might present as a high risk pattern. Then when this pattern appears, parents, physicians can be alerted weeks in advance. So long before a problem becomes emergent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hospitals save money not having to update hardware boxes with limited intelligence, that quickly become outdated, to inexpensive devices with limitless intelligence since the intelligence is in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poorer hospitals in poor areas, remote hospitals don't have to limit themselves to the number of sensors monitoring equipment because it's cheap and readily available.
