                <p>
                    Throughout history, we've invented better and better ways of interfacing with machines. The
                    <strong>
                        mouse
                    </strong>
                    , the
                    <strong>
                        VirtualBoy
                    </strong>
                    , the
                    <strong>
                        nub mouse thing
                    </strong>
                    on ThinkPads. But we weren't satisfied with the current state of input devices. As computers become more and more personal and more and more a part of our daily lives, we need better,
                    <strong>
                        more efficient
                    </strong>
                    ways of interacting with them. One of the biggest inefficiencies in modern desktop computing is moving your hands from the keyboard to the track pad. So we got rid of that. Yup. Really.

                    </strong>

                <p>
                    It's built in Swift 2.0 (for the easy C interoperability) and partially Obj-C for certain functions.
