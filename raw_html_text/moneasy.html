                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's society, financial literacy is an always repeating buzzword. We wanted to help educate the people, but took the challenge from a different perspective. We were going to teach children the basics of finance, so they have a solid foundation of knowledge when they learn more about it in their teenage years and adulthood. We also thought about how children love using their phones, and how to redirect this enthusiasm to something useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides the user - a child - with a simple way of managing their spending. We use simple graphics, vivid colors and simple userfaces to keep the child engaged. We use unobtrusive methods to give the child financial advice and tips how to better spend their money. We process some of their data to give them customized advice, because we think the more personal it is, the more memorable it gets and can really stick with the child. There is also a goal system in place, giving the child motivation to save up their money for a goal they created. In our minds, the app could be expanded so it gets the expense data from the user's bank account, or even be connected to a parent's account to provide them with their child's spending report or parental controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After spending a lot of time designing and establishing the basic premise of the systems, we had a concept we were happy with. Only after that did we start actually coding and creating our app. We used public domain art for the graphics, Node.js with Express for server-side scripting, Postgresql as our database, basic jQuery scripts for front-end user friendliness,  Ajax for the best UX and tons and tons of CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inexperience with any complex programming or technologies. Our team had 4 students and all most of our skills were web development related. So we did what we could, and created a web app. This was at times tricky, because creating an application in an unusual environment meant we had to think about stuff like responsiveness and browser support. On backend, things also weren't going all smooth. Managing databases and Ajax requests in Node.js was something we didn't know too much about. Ultimately, we managed quite well and pieced together a functioning website.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was the first hackathon all of us participated in, we didn't have high expectations. To our surprise, we managed to push our project to a state, where the basics were fully functioning and presentable. We had a solid idea and executed it quite well. We put our skills together, each doing what they know the best, helping one another, and in the end something all of us were happy with and proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was an amazing opportunity for us to learn new technologies, and gain experience. We all worked on a real-time team project for the first time, tried new technologies like Git, Postgresql and Ajax and improved in Node.js, jQuery or CSS.
