                    How we built it: We built this by utilizing Google Cloud's Machine Learning API (Vision ), along with various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Pillow, and more. In addition, we also used Node.js and Express JS along with Mapbox's API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We've ran into a lot of issues involving Google's API, information gathering and at the end, the realization that the amount of information we had were numerous. It would take over 10 hours to train the model so we have reduced the size of our data for purposes of the hackathon.
