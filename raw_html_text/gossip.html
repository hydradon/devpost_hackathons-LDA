                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game is inspired by a popular children's game where all the kids sit around in a circle. The first kids whispers something to the kid on the right. That kid repeats what he heard to the kid on his right. This continues around the circle until the last kid gets told. That kid says what he heard out loud and this typically sounds nothing like what was first said and shows how Gossip changes as it's repeated from person to person.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application will work like this but will run in Azure and it will prompt for some Gossip. The player will say their gossip and the app will translate it to text and display it on the screen first, then it will send the request and text to the closest service where the application is deployed to in Azure. Using a specified language for each region, we will translate the text it to the closest language of an Azure region where the application is deployed. The game will then display the translated text and show the language it was translated to. This will continue until we arrive back to the English language and we will get to see what the text becomes at the end.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using UWP we built the front end and it will listen to input from the user, save the audio and send it up to an Azure web service. The Azure Web Service will then translate the speech into text using Cognitive Services APIs and display it on the screen. The request is then sent to the next server region where Azure is
