                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build a very simple skill that tells a user if an item can be added to compost. My hope is that a skill like this encourages others to do more composting (and reduce what is added to landfills). I built the original skill last year, and decided to update it to provide Echo Show/Spot support and add troubleshooting functionality.
                </p>

                    Compost Helper can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        tell you if an item can (or cannot) be composted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        give you a list of compostable items
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        give you tips to fix composting problems (if your compost is too wet, or smelly, or dry)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I created a custom slot called "LIST_OF_ITEMS". This slot contains 100+ household items that a user might inquire about
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I created a JSON list of the items, with the following attributes: Item (oranges), Answer (yes), AddOn (" you add them in small amounts and you open split the fruit").
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I use the Fuse.js library to do "fizzy matching" against the JSON list to find the best match (e.g. napkins = paper napkins = used napkins)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JSON attributes are used to construct the reply: "Yes, you can compost oranges if you add them in small amounts and you split open the fruit"
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are a lot of items that can be composted! It took a while to compile the list.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    My hope is that this helps others that want to get into composting. Plus, I have versions in most English speaking locales (US, Canada, UK, Australia, India).

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ultimately want to convert the JSON list into an API that can be used on a website, bot, Alexa, or other devices/technologies. The API would return images (maybe) and additional composting tips (e.g. split avocado pits when composting).
