                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a crisis resulting in mass casualties, victims, and/or missing persons. The current system for reuniting the affected is incredibly inefficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website uses AI Facial Recognition technology to match photos of missing loved ones with people rescued by emergency services. It then notifies the immediate family through an automated email produced through UIPath.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was created using HTML and CSS. UIPath was also integrated.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it most difficult to streamline the process on the police services side as we wanted to make sure that this process did not inconvenience or distract them.
                </p>
