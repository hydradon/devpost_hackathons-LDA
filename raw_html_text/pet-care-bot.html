                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a dog at home who is always alone because the family is either at work or school. Sometimes the dog can cause trouble by chewing furniture. I wanted to create something that can watch over the dog.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, the robot is able to drive around and follow the pet by using the camera that is implemented into the robot.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The body of the robot was made out of a simple weather-proof box in which I drilled holes through. From there, I used two gear motors that are connected to the raspberry pi to move. These motors spun the wheels so that it can move.  I used raspberry pi 3 to control the robot. I programmed the robot using python and the opencv library to create the vision system so that the robot can 'see' the pet.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that I faced was getting openCV to work. It took me a few hours to figure out the problem and how to solve it. Another problem that I faced was getting the motors to work. The code for the motors worked but the motors did not spin. I assume that they fried and are inoperable.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first hackathon and the biggest project I have worked on. I am proud that I was able to get so much done is such a little time. It was great to see how the robot was able to grow

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about vision systems and hope to continue
                </p>

                    What's next for Pet Care Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to complete the tasks that I was unable to finish. I also hope to continue with building the robot by implementing a feeder into it and even a speaker to communicate to the pet. At the end, I hope to put it out to the public so that everyone can have one.
