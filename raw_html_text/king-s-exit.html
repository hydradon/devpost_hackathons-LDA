                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a turn-based strategy game essentially on a whim.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    King's Exit is a simple turn-based strategy game where players move pieces across the board to try and reduce the hitpoints of their opponent's gold piece to zero. Different pieces have different movement speeds and attack ranges and strength. Orange pieces move 1 tile at a time, purple ones move two at a time, and brown ones can attack an opposing piece from four tiles away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built entirely from scratch in NetBeans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had any real experience with graphics programming in Java. We spent a significant amount of time just figuring out what we were doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that the game is actually in a playable state. (If you have two players) Our lack of graphics experience consumed a large amount of our time.
                </p>

                    What's next for King's Exit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially adding a computer player functionality or putting it up on a server somewhere with multiplayer functionality.
