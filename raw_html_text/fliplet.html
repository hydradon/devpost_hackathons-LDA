                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Reactjs for our frontend. We try to store it on our data on Google FireBase database but ran in to issues, so we use and array objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into set up a configuration to our Database. We tried to fetch data from our Firebase DB but it would only return the response body with no data. We ended up getting our account temporarily shut down due to the large volume of requests we were sending to the Database. Also learning CSS from scratch is harder than expected. All the elements a while to align. We still have an issue with up scaling and down scaling the screen size. We also had a hard time learning the event of javascript. no one had any idea what is happening and why is it breaking because we all decided to learn a new language that no one knew how to do from scratch.
