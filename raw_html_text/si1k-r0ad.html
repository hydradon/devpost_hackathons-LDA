                        a glaring problem
                    </a>
                    within the pharmaceutical industry with drug pricing, thus reducing consumer access to necessary drugs because of the financial burden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform gives consumers the ability to bulk-buy pharmaceutical drugs at a lower price. It caters to both consumers and suppliers. Consumers can choose whatever drug they would like to group-buy with others, regardless of their location - our platform works to bring everyone from everywhere together to purchase and bulk-buy drugs at a cheaper price. Suppliers get to sell their products and set a timeline of how long the product will stay live and the quota required to sell the products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a smart contract that allows different users to come together and execute group/bulk purchases. Then we were able to connect it to a front-end React app using web3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an initial idea for this competition was the hardest thing that our team faced. Some technical challenges we ran into include trying to develop a working front-end that interacts with out smart contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all got to know more about the pharmaceutical industry. From a business standpoint, we learned to consider the practical limitations and caveats and brainstorm different solutions that would off-set each in the long-run. From a technical standpoint, we got better at developing smart contracts and React development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In most cases, there will be blatant reasons why some ideas will not work, some more glaring than others. However, in most cases, it's probably because you're not focused on something specific to hone in on, and possibly it's because you're trying to put a solution to a problem that you're looking for. It's also helpful to go back to the origin of the question you're trying to answer and compare your response against your counter-argument.
                </p>

                    What's next for pharmable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides not getting any sleep, we expect to generate a gradual increase in demand of our platform so to mitigate our current, short-term limitations in the lack of guarantee of obtaining the drug, the platform not catering to those who instantly need the drug, and the fact that the process is not quick. We also want to make a more intuitive interface for consumers and users alike.
