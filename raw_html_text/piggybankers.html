                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are constantly struggling with managing finances and we want to create an app that makes fiscal responsibility fun by visualizing financial goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes your financial information (Salary, usual expenses, bank statements) and categorizes your expenses, keeping you in the track of how much you are spending while showing your progress to achieving your goals for saving. The goals are in the form of Piggy Banks you can prioritize. IT also rewards the user by showing badges when achieving specified goals and providing a rank based on how much/long the user has been saving.
