                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the recent loss of 7 hikers in the Zion National Park, a flash flood warning system could help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flash Alert starts by collecting and associating historical data from rain fall, stream data to formulate a predictable method for flash flood severity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using historical weather data and IBM Data Scientists to figure out the movement of the rain pattern, and then mapping it to a new function from ESRI and other government data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Need time and resource to generate the variable rate in each "flow region".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get the concept formulated because of all the great help from weather, esri and IBM.
                </p>
