                    Inspiration and what it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    as a Berkeley student have you ever been looking for a haircut to only find out you have to shell out $20.... Trying to find a unique way to save money, I thought about barbers in training. Wouldnt they be cheap and qualified cause they need people to try their haircutting skills on to actually get a job!! This web app solves both a buyer and seller's concern -- given the buyer a cost-effective and reliable method of getting some objective done while the skill provider a method to actually develop their skill (which they may not have been able to do otherwise).

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we tried to implement a database using firebase so that we can store information in real-time and upload it to the website, but due to our limited knowledge we couldn't implement it properly (even though we learned how to do it!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a basic outline for a website!!!!!! we are also super proud to have actually built something as first time hackers, finding a like-minded team during the hackathon itself, working together to develop such a unique idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned so much, not only about coding but the new tools in the market, for example, the Microsoft vision api is such a neat feature which can be implemented by anyone with little to no skill! We also learned a lot about working as a team and about other peoples ideas and their inspiration for their projects which is so fascinating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SkillBuilder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement a social aspect and database so that we can create a community of learners. We're also interested in adding financial transactions in the actual program to add a level of convenience for those selling their skills.
