                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design and create a game from scratch using Unity's game development platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players assume control of a character that is spawned in a procedurally generated maze. They can shoot other capsules to kill them.
                </p>
