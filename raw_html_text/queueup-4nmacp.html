                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through too many different platforms: discord, snapchat, sms, etc, have we received game invites that didn't apply to us. Our project is an effort to combine known status information from discord and personal schedules to strengthen game invites that mean the most to players available to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a discord bot to work as an quick invite manager. A website provides statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python for the discord bot and a node.js as a server, both instances are able to communicate through a firebase database to manage a system capable of pinging players in discord depending on whether they are online or scheduled to be available. Players can mention times they'll be busy throughout a given week and
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the discord.py and other python libraries wasn't bad, but getting pyrebase or python-firebase to work with our google cloud database was something we never quite got. Instead, we used .json file and requests to attempt to get our data live and displayed. Furthermore, we wanted to do a version of the application in which users were seen as interesting in playing a game whenever they launched said game after reading the bot command (posted by another user). However, we could not find a way to view users changing their activity or starting up a game as an event, and therefore compromised by using (message) reactions instead.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating my first discord bot and getting even more familiar with Python. Also creating a cool front end that makes our project become more useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about integrating the discord.py library and discord bots/python as a whole.

                    What's next for queueUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More bot functionality, more features on the website, and hosting the bot with some service would be nice (instead of running it on my computer).
