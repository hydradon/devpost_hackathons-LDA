                    The game server and logic were written in es6 javascript, and powered by nodejs, express and socket.io. The client-side architecture was written with jade and stylus for html and css preprocessing respectively and our views were written with ReactJS.

                    We got a simple MVP working! 95% of our UI was completed (minus styling and animations) and we were able to successfully create a simple game server using socket.io that allows users to create and join games.
