                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device creates an unmistakable, unignorable, uninterruptable alarm tone. To stop the alarm tone you must win a game. The game is a simple one but hard on the sleepy. Arrows pop up on an OLED display like Dance Dance Revolution and the user must use the provided analogue stick to match the direction. As the arrows change an led strip changes colour. After five correct directions, the LED strip goes green and you win the game. The number of directions left before the game is won is displayed below the arrows.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino 101, QLED display, joystick, LED strip and a buzzer. The code was written in the Arduino IDE and tracked using GitHub.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues getting the QLED display to update quickly. All the equipment we initially needed ran out. We had GitHub merging issues.

                    We achieved our initial goals and made a working device.

                    What's next for Super Alarm Galaxy Revolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intended to send the number of misses, the speed and level of difficulty to a phone via Bluetooth. This information could then be shared with friends. We then wanted to use this data to send money to charity/ savings account, with Authorize.Net, as punishment for being to slow or getting too many directions wrong.
