                    I was inspired by other 3D race/dash-type games (ie. Temple Run) and of course, my spirit as a scarlet knight!

                    What Rutgers Dash does is simple - just hit play and avoid the obstacles!

                <h2>
                    I built this on Unity with models I created myself in Maya. I imported the models from Maya into Unity, and used online tutorials to learn anything I needed to know.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I had to teach myself to use Unity to create this project, so there were many frustrating hours of watching tutorials and scouring through my code to find bugs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'm very proud of basically teaching myself to use Unity and Maya!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned both the basics of Unity and Maya and how to find help online through YouTube and Google.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I hope to integrate more interesting models as I gain more fluency with the languages and programs required - for example, I'd love to make the player a Rutgers bus (or other Rutgers-themed avatars). I also intend to include more possible actions (ie. ducking down) and a points/rewards system (ie. coins above obstacles). I may even indicate that some of the obstacles are meant to be hit and some are meant to be avoided.
