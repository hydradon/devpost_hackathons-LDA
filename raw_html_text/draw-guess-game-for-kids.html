                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team (me and my wife :) ) like and enjoy much of playing famous Pictionary game. As we were thinking how we can adapt it to play on voice enabled devices, we came up with this project idea. We create a template drawing sheet to make it applicable for voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Draw &amp; Guess Game is a Pictionary-like Word Guessing Game for all ages, offers you great fun. You can also improve your drawing, imagination and 3D thinking skills. Game is simple and fun! Alexa speaks the drawing instructions step by step and the player follows her by drawing on a pre-made drawing sheet. This drawing guide is a free downloadable PDF document. You will need at least one blank drawing sheet for each drawing challenge. So consider printing out as many as you need. ***Online purchasable notebook version is being prepared at the moment. It will be available soon for your order on Amazon soon.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Before start the game, you need to download and print out this free drawing sheet:

                            https://bit.ly/drawing-sheet
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grab your pen! A bold point colour pen is recommended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You're ready to go! Now start the challenge!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In each challenge, you draw a word. The goal is to try to guess the word the drawing is intended to represent. At the end of the each drawing challenge, you make your guess to identify the drawing on the sheet, then continue with the next one. There are more than 10 challenges right now. Lots of new chapters are coming soon.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Amazon Skill Kit. Our team of two divided the tasks as one for code development and one for level design. It took me some time to get used to the developer console but when we dive in coding it was great fun to making progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Level design task was the hardest part of the development. We have really tough times to adapt shapes onto our drawing sheet which only allows drawing straight lines between hundred dots. We worked hard to keep it simple but enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we've created a neat game that will amaze people (especially Pictionary game funs), and also help them to improve their drawing and 3D thinking skills while they're having fun. At least we enjoyed a lot, during our tests. We carefully select shapes/words among tons of alternatives and eliminate the rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first project using ASK. We have been using Alexa at home and enjoying its benefits. Being on the developer side is really cool. Creating new things for people -especially to make time - is really exciting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're willing to add more challenging levels by releasing new updates periodically.
