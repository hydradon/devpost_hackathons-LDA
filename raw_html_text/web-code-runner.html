                    At the moment, it serves as an editor for files within a virtualized file system in local storage (using

                    ). It currently only has a runner for Scheme code, built on top of another project of mine. I attempted to add the

                    </a>
                    to run Java code (additionally, since this is a JVM, once I got Doppio working, I could have added support for any language that can target the JVM), however, due to some issues with the Doppio documentation, I was not able to get it working.

                    What's next

                <p>
                    Obviously, this project would need runners for more languages to actually be useful (particularly since the Scheme interpreter I used for the Scheme runner already has a built-in editor). With more time, I'd like to get Doppio working and also try adding support for one of the many JS Python runtimes.
