                    This simple-looking game is designed to give a calming experience to the user. The different color ranges and the variety of ways to change the paint to the user's liking, while still keeping the actual paint color a surprise. The hidden lesson here is regardless of the way that humans can change their world around them, there are still things that cannot be changed. And that's okay. ZenPainting brings the user a sense of calm as they click away, and hopefully after using the program the user will bring that calm with them. Calmer, happier people are much less likely to harass or harm others so if more people play ZenPainting and get its calming effects, the world will be a much better place.
