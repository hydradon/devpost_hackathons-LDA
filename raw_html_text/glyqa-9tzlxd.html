                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A strong desire to change lives and make positive impact on the chronic patient population, drove the Eviga team members to undertake the building of Glyqa. The open availability of wealth of data in the form of population health metrics and CDC prevalent indicators, and potential of insights and resources that could be delivered to an individual patient, was an inspiration point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Glyqa, uses patient interactions of various forms namely, symptom tracking/rating, home-based self-testing, blood glucose monitoring - to calculate a propensity quotient (PQ) for each complication (arising from chronic condition) which, displays progression of disease state. With a nurse-line built within Glyqa, a context specific advice can be sought by patients and delivered by providers, enabling chronic patients to feel assured of support from their care provider. Glyqa, enhances the effectiveness of traditional diabetes management programs by establishing and maintaining an engagement channel between patients and the providers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we identified chronic condition as a larger problem to go after, we pivoted multiple times eventually landing into one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, namely Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). For the validation of the problem statement, we consulted with many practicing endocrinologists and real-life T2DM patients across various degrees of disease state. After a lot of brainstorming sessions, meet-ups, and networking events, we graduated to solve the problem by leveraging the intersection of mobile and data technologies.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't come from medical practice background which, has been our biggest challenge to-date, as this had overarching effects in, network we can tap, knowing the general practices and lay of the land, and inert reception to our ideas/thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have since the inception of the idea and multiple pivots, come a long way! While we started in a domain alien to us and were challenged initially with the pace, slowly but surely we have been connecting dots and making progress. For instance, we have in the past year alone, engaged multiple physicians in a meaningful conversation, met with established practicing and researching endocrinologist and won their confidence. We are proud of building a great team that is involved in design and development of the product, functionally and technically.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt a great deal about chronic conditions and how some of these conditions affect the lives of patients and their families. One of our best learning has been about the data publicly hosted by CDC about chronic conditions and great insights that can be derived from those torrents of data. In the process of building mobile therapeutics for patients, we have also learnt the importance of target population (age, community, income levels etc.), general app adoption, form factor, and positive experience to the patient.

                <h2>
                    What's next for GLYQA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our immediate goal is to conduct pilot study on a set of diabetes patients spanning 3-6 months, and so finding a suitable pilot site and designing the pilot format is our near-future goal. Upon the successful completion of the pilot and publishing outcomes, we like to launch the product for availability through relevant channels (providers, physician networks, diabetes management programs, etc.). Also, between now and general product availability, we like to explore the investments from interested partners with common vision.
