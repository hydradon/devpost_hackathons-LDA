                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domestic violence is a preventable public health problem that does not discriminate and can happen to anyone regardless of age, race, gender, education, wealth, or sexuality. Often, barriers to healthcare or lack of a support system prevents victims from connecting to the resources that already exist. Other times, the resources are not presented or advertised in a way that is accessible to the people who need it the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Limacon' is similar to the name of one of the women who inspired me to make this website, who is a survivor of domestic violence, was able to leave her relationship, and became a social health worker, advocate of survivors, and educator to raise awareness about the public health issue of domestic violence. I want this website to contribute to the increase in support for and conversation around how we can address domestic violence symptoms and root causes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is an accessible place that empowers people in abusive relationships who are looking for resources to make choices about what steps they want to take, whether it's talking to someone on the phone, finding a local resource, talking to someone trained to help minors, or learning more about what their legal rights are. Limacon connects people to organizations and groups that are available to help them, through a simple, approachable design. The website also aims to have an education section for people who are not victims but want to learn more about the reality of domestic violence through data visualization.
