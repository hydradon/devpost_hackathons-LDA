                    Inspiration: Our inspiration were ourselves. We have trouble keeping track of money and reaching our goal. Also, this skill helps kids become more responsible with their money and not wasting it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Our skill, Money Manager, serves as a similarity to a bank account where the user can deposit money, withdraw money, check their current balance, and quit the skill.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How We built it: We, step by step, looked through the process of a banking system and how to replicate it. Through many trial and errors, we finally came to a final program that worked well.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into: When testing on echosim.io, a parent's consent was needed. We were able to use an echo dot and give permission so that we could test.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We are proud of: We were able to overcome challenges that we faced such as the parent's consent.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What We learned: We learned that teamwork is very important in this kind of situation because two ideas may contribute to one as a whole, so the more ideas, the better.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Manager: We are planning to expand Money Manager for not only kids, but parents so that our skill is not limited.
