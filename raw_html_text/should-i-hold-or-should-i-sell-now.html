                    </em>
                    . In times of political uncertainty, you want to make sure you don't lost out to the harsh and mysterious fluctuations of the foreign exchange market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making the most of TransferWise's Borderless Account features, we split your transfer into small transactions and execute them at optimal times during your desired transfer window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This saves you from the wasted time and worry of repetitively checking exchange rates - just tell us how much to transfer, and by when!
