                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanting to provide help with things that I am good at. But at the same time, wanting to receive help when I need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to designate themselves an "expert" in a category. They are then placed in a chat with anyone who needs help in that category.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Xcode and Swift. The Parse and Firebase databases are hosted in the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of null pointers, especially with segueing between views. The transition into the chat aspect took a few hours to debug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really proud of getting multiple databases to sync across the internet, to the point where users can send each other messages and have their preferences/logins saved!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Database setups can be hard! In addition, it takes a lot of concentration to go through and debug complex logic required for chat and database synchronization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ExpertChat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More options of communication! Settings for experts to be persistent. Not having to wait in the window while waiting for a session.
                </p>
