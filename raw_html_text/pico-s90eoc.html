                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ICOs sometimes play a questioned role in crypto economic, for whitepapers are not easy to understand by ordinary investors, both technically and economically, and once done, technically there is no restraint for the already profited team. As a result of some bad examples, both investors and honest teams were harmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bancor protocol is an asynchronous price discovery mechanism, also offers a good practice for creating tokens based on one or more connector token(s), the later provides reserved value for the new tokens, and for a given connector weight, the curve of a created token&rsquo;s price could be predictable and transparent to end users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our idea is that the ICO should be a procedure, which takes a period of time, and Bancor&rsquo;s connector weight factor could be involved in all along the procedure of initialization of the new token, and other factors should also be considered, such as the necessary project funding, the interaction between the developing team and investors, the adjustment of TF function/parameters(by governance voting of investors, for example) during ICO procedure according to the progress of development. The TF settled, the potential profit of the team would be visible to investors. We are aiming to construct a bridge of trust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We add a TF(aka Team Funding) factor to the original formula of bancor. TF should be a function defined by the team, may take parameters like funding time, token issued/destroyed, connector token paid/returned etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This TF factor is added on behalf of the continuity of the team&rsquo;s funding, for their reasonable need or profit without avarice. It will be designed by the team out of its own consideration, and once the extended contract is deployed, it could stimulate and demonstrate the predicting curves of both buying and selling, give investors a clear idea how much contribution they will make to the project and how much they could profit from an early involvement, help to make decisions.
                </p>

                    On buying, the formula will look like:

                <p>
                    In-between buying and then selling the same number of smart tokens on the same total supply, the team funding collects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    team funding increasement = connector tokens paid(buying) - connector tokens paid out(selling)
