                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was pulled using the SOLR API and then presented in intuitive way through a map and charts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API presented some problems. Also getting the charts to display data from a certain province was an issue
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a good chunk of our idea into a presentable format. We ended up with something that represents the initial vision well while doing this in a small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the SOLR API and also that Google provides a good way to easily visualize data.
