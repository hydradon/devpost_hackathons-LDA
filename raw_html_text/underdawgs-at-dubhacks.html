                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our team began hacking, we began feeling overwhelmed by the amount of technology and experience that surrounded us. We found ourselves completely changing project ideas due to our lack of technical experience, and we began wondering if other people felt the same way. It turns out, almost every team we talked to was struggling in a significant way. But, they thought everyone else was flying through their projects without challenges. We want this project to let people who are struggling know that it's okay, and to add transparency to the hackathon experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We checked in with selected groups at the Hackathon throughout the weekend, interviewed them on-camera, and edited the footage in Premiere Pro.
