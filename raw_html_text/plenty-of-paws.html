                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to develop a project to connect single felines across the globe. As pet owners ourselves, we understand the struggle that cats face when it comes to finding a mate. As a stereotypically solitary creature, cats are often unable to make meaningful relationships in the real world. Concerned pet owners are at a loss as to how they can help their beloved family members to find their purrfect match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plenty of Paws is a website where cats create a profile. They talk about themselves and what kind of cat they are looking for. Members can email each other to connect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Html5, CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginner programmers, most of our group has not worked with html or css before. Not having an understanding of javascript or php also lead to some features being impossible to create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great first step into learning how to use html and css. We managed to create a prototype navigation bar from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group learned the basics of html and css in order to create a working website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plenty of Paws
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working "Create Your Profile" page where cats can submit their dating profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A login page for the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A messaging system that works on the website instead of email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An algorithm that matches cats based on compatibility.
