                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was restaurants taking too much time to attend to their customers. For busy times such as these, wasting time at a restaurant seems to be something everyone can agree to avoid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app helps make an association between a customer at a restaurant and the servers at that restaurant. From the user perspective, they are able to ask the server for simple commands such as "refill", "chips", or "cheque". On the Servers side they are able to see all the customers they are associated to at that moment. The server will be able to see the request from each of the customers and go serve them accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Xcode using Swift. The process was painstaking as there is a lot of logic and database work to be designed. We then used FireBase as our database. We weren't used to using a No-SQL database,so working on this app helped us learn a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was that very deep into our project and the weekend, we had merge conflicts that hindered and took our project back many steps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept was a very novel idea, and a topic that we're passionate about. Getting over the hurdle of git conflicts and coming out stronger on the other side is also something we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so many new technologies and got a clearer view of MVC architecture.
                </p>

                    What's next for Walt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The perfect extension for Walt would be on the IWatch.
