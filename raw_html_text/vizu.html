                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a world powered by technology and yet we stilll use paper and flat symbols to display 3D ideas. We created Vizu in order to jump across this gap and augment a 3D model where-ever they need one. Teachers needed a way to describe complex ideas but can typically only do so through flat images and text. There are many other applications for Vuzu however improving education was one of our main focuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vizu uses the camera on laptop or phone in order to recognize a symbol that corresponds with a 3D model. When this symbol recognized, Vizu will augment the 3D model into the scene in order to make it look like it is there in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vuforio and Amazon Web Services in order to recognize images and store the data associated with them. We also used Unity as the basis for the application. On top of this we made a website where users can submit new symbols and models in order to be able to recognize them on the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we used so many different services from various companies it was hard to interface from one to the other.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major updates will come in the near future. We hope to add additional functionality to provide users with the ability to identify multiple symbols on a PDF document.
