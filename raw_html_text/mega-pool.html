                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming ideas for BrickHack
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a fun game which combines pool and first person shooting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on Unity throughout the course of the BrickHack, starting with basic movement and terrain and moving onto the complicated controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had troubles with implementing the rules of pool during the time period, so we decided to stick with the basics and polish the core gameplay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first actual 3D game and it was a great experience, learning from the ground up and seeing things come together, and the gameplay being genuinely fun. Also, we finally got controller support right after a lot of time spent on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is just so much stuff we learned. Besides the obvious coding and design experience, we also learnt how to manage our expectations and get the best product out in the limited amount of time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mega Pool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely plan to polish the game more and add more rules and features to it. The game has the potential to be really fun and it is simple enough that it could be run on a large diversity of platforms.
