                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While tutoring, Zemann found himself in a situation where a colour-blind student was unable to read a printed pie chart. Despite some accessibility tools existing to correct this on a screen, it was very difficult for him to correct this in real-time, in real-life. Existing technologies - such as wearable glasses - are often prohibitively expensive, meaning the colour blind are often forced to live with this invisible disability. We wanted to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChromaVision is a web application and Google Chrome extension which allows the user to identify colours in real time, and correct their vision to allow them to see in simulated colour. The web application consists of a camera, allowing the user to identify colours in the real world, not just on a screen. Paired with the extension, the camera alters its colour profile using chromaticity to increase viewability for people with any type of colour blindness.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application is a simple JavaScript application, with cutting edge HTML5 and CSS3 code supporting it. Using the latest technologies allowed us to develop a responsive, fluid experience for the user. The extension is built upon an existing Google extension, fully customized for our use. This extension makes the use of the research paper &ldquo;A Physiologically-based Model for Simulation of Color Vision Deficiency&rdquo; by Gustavo M. Machado, Manuel M. Oliveira to determine the RGB values of different types of color-blind people, as well as the Confusion Lines of the CIE 1931 Color Space to alter the colors. JavaScript and JSON along with HTML5 and CSS3 power the extension; used in concert with the web app, it solves many problems.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Using python scripts to run in the backend with web framework which was ultimately non-feasible so we just went with JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Low familiarity with JavaScript made this a heavy learning experience.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As none of us were familiar with JavaScript or Chrome extensions prior to this project, we
                    <em>
                        all
                    </em>
                    learned a significant amount in both realms. We also learned more about colour-blindness as a disability and are more conscientious of the issues faced by the colourblind.
                </p>

                        Mounting a camera with Raspberry Pi and using it to convert colours in real-time for users and try to replace the $2000 glasses available in the market. A Raspberry Pi Kit costs $40 with the Pi Camera included and the screen costs around $20 to be mounted on any glasses giving us a net cost of around $80 which is way lesser than $2000
