                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge for this hackathon was our main inspiration "connect the dots".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple chat application that focuses on the user interface/design. Nowadays, User design is a big factor in consumer usage and consumer loyalty. User interface can change the way how a user feels and interacts with the application. We developed a chat application just like a round table so people can chat while taking on the values of a round table (equability, loyalty, honesty). While chat applications  have been implemented before, they don't take into account user design and how they affect the consumer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just so we can show a concrete tangible version of our concept. We built it using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the fact that we all come from a hardware background, we challenged ourselves by taking on a software project. This came with a lot of learning and debugged. In addition, we traveled by car from Toronto Canada which was quite the mission, leaving us drained on the first day of hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of attempting to solve a real world issue by improving and innovating the user interface of instant messenger chats. On the other hand, we are proud to have a working website that reflects the original idea we came up with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned various skills by attending workshops and listening to the sponsor talks. In terms of our hack, we learned a bunch of new web development software skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoundTable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to UI to look even better for people to feel free in a safe space. We want them to feel that same as if they are on a real round table. We initially tried to make a VR app regarding this concepts
