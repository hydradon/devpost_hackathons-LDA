                <p>
                    With event planning, we often find ourselves overwhelmed with multiple details that need to be taken care of. For instance inviting each guest separately, selecting the ideal location/time to organise the event or selecting music to set the perfect ambience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventor reduces all this stress, as it replaces the traditional pen and paper method of planning. We can now log into an account on the website, and plan your entire event right there! The features include:
