                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that it was hard to find like minded individuals to program with and it was also hard to find groups to compete in hackathons with before hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows users to search for people with similar skills or skills that they would like to learn and request to connect with them. If a connection is made, both users' social media accounts (Facebook Messenger) is displayed so the users can communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using Node.js and React Native. We used Node.js for the backend and React Native for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time using React and Node we ran into problems figuring out how to set up the environments, and we also had trouble integrating the programs. We got stuck on sending and receiving data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this hackathon, two of us had zero experience with node and react and after building this application we have enough understanding to use react and node again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the user interface and also how databases work and store data via using react and node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Find a Friend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue developing this application so that we can publish it and people can start to use it to connect with other like minded individuals.
