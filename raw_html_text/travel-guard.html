                    I was sick in Barcelona and no one could help, no one was supporting Finnish travel insurance and I was just on my own without any help from medical workers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides medical information in several languages about its owner and by pushing the button it's possible to call for emergency and inform all close friends/family with GPS, current situation. No more language barriers and headed with insurance burocracy.
