                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wonder how many trolls lurk on your favorite sub-reddit? Want to know their alternate accounts?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use TrollHuntr to hunt the trolls. TrollHuntr scrapes subreddits to find Troll, Throwaway and Alternate Accounts. Then using machine learning it tries to uncover the real accounts behind the trolls.

                    How We built it

                <p>
                    TrollHuntr was built using Python. The Reddit API and Praw were used to scrape subreddits and user data. SciKit Learn was used for all machine learning aspects
