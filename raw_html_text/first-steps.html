                <p>
                    I was inspired to tackle this project because it felt that it was something that needed to be addressed and it was not being addressed,

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a beautiful web application aka website to build my project,

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge I an into was debugging the code sometimes it is hard to identify an error on your own because you have been looking for it so long and couldn't find anything. I rectified this problem by handing my computer off to someone else and having them find the error.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
