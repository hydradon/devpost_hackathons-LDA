                    Finding the right product when shopping online can be frustrating. In certain devices it is not easy to find stuff by typing and it can be challenging for people with visual or other impairments. Messaging apps have become the centre of online activity as they serve for more and more purposes. For example, the millions of users of WeChat in China tap the service to send money to friends, buy shoes and even book doctors&rsquo; appointments.
