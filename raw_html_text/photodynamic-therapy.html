                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An improved way of delivering PDT (Photodymanic Therapy) for surface level lesions. The idea is to create a modified array of LED lights (two types with spectral peak differences of 10 - 15nm), and vary the current through the lights slightly to produce an exitation light custom to each patient. Blue light photos will be taken of the treatment area after each treatment to track progress. The goal is to along with the doctor&rsquo;s qualitative input, implement a machine learning algorithm to deliver the most ideal spectrum of light to the patient depending on their previous progress, required light penetration depth, and the similarity of physiology with other patients.
