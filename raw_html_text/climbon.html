                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love rock climbing, but climbing in Indiana is hard because it is illegal, the closest legal crags to us are Mascatatuck and the Red River Gorge. We want people to be able to find the crags that are near them whenever they go rock climbing! We included gyms and ratings because at our uni they rate their routes really difficultly so, in addition to finding locations near you, you can also get a sense of how hard the gym is to climb!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app shows you nearby crags and gyms, as well as the weather forecast for the day, links to our favorite gear sites and forms for you to be able to post a comment about a route or crag you went to!
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We just kept bashing our keyboards until something worked. We bashed keyboards with React, Firebase, Google Could, Dark-Sky, Geolocation Apis. fadslkjhfaksldbgjkahgiowbigbasdgboikl sdcvas dpowehkjaesfkashjkasfkjasd kfhbsadjhfb

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, getting the current location was good, but we had a lot of issues trying to calculate nearby crags and gyms. Near the end of the deadline, we had seen so many cool climbing photos and wished we were climbing.

                    The app as a whole we are proud of! One of the partners is still really new to development and resolved many front-end challenges.

                    Add colors to the UI. Let users comment on locations. Give each location its own page. Host is on AWS.
