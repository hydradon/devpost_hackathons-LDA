                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration comes from being in a long-standing relationship and being both the girlfriend ready to pull her hair out when her boyfriend forgets to do something important and from feeling clueless in planning dates and special days for bae.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has a very simple user interface that will take you and your significant other's preferences for food and activities, and using the Yelp API find things that will interest you in that area. The Yelp API is also utilized in displaying local areas to get gifts. The app includes a tab for special occasions so you will never forget an anniversary or birthday again. A promises tab allows you to write down any commitment you've made to prevent any fights about broken promises. Finally, a notes tab allows you to jot anything else down about your significant other you feel is important, like their clothing size, the name of their friends and family, whatever you can imagine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tab was built using mit-app-installer, which surprisingly gave a variety of features and so did not inhibit the vision of the application in any way. We found using this program advantageous as it allowed us to make the user interface as clean as possible. The graphics for the application were designed using Adobe Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges using the drag and drop system of mit-app-installer as some customization and formatting did not come intuitively. We also ran into customizing the Yelp searches to make them appear clean and continuous with the format of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the clean user interface and ease at which individuals are able to use this application. We are also proud of the idea of the application itself, we feel it fills a useful niche in today's culture and creatively goes about solving common issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to bring a Mac to hackathons from now on because there is no guarantee we will find somebody who specializes in iOS to join our team. We also learned you don't need to be a coding expert to contribute greatly to a project of this nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lumiere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to enable the application with more features and also move it to an iOS market.
