                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had found that finance managers were inefficient and hard to use; I created a simple, very efficient way to manage your budget and get alerted when bills are due!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the main page, simple instructions are given to use the application. You can create a new file, or open an existing one for modification. When creating a new file, there is a short questionnaire that
                    <strong>
                        builds
                    </strong>
                    the tables for you, so it is easier to input values. Each budget file is stored in a "Database" folder. Also, coming close or on the last day of every month, the application will create a large, visible popup to remind you to stay on time with the bills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python for the entire project, and I created my own database format in python as well. I used the Tkinter GUI development kit to create the visuals.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had dynamically created entry boxes to enter values in but had a hard time reassigning each value when the same file was reopened. Fortunately, I fixed the problem.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to create a database, draw out files, and the ability for the application to fit the user's needs by adding or subtracting value boxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became more experienced in database creation and user-fitting applications. (Ones that change due to changes made by the user)

                    What's next for Budget Visualizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to add annual budget charts as well as weekly budget charts, and I am going to graph each table for easier reading
