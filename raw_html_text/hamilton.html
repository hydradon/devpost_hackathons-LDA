                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Hamilton came from one of America's founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton. Even though he was an immigrant to the United States, he was still a vital part in making our country into the strong nation that it is today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hamilton is a web application that immigrants login to view jobs and their locations based upon previous work experiences. It also allows the user the ability to change the language at the top of the page using the Google Translate API, and chatting with companies on the website using Socket.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project on the PHP Laravel framework. The theme throughout the site is a clean look, simple, yet professional. Bootstrap classes, cards, columns, are all common parts of the web pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a couple challenges implementing Google Maps API, Google Translate API on the website. These were supposed to be simple additions, but since it was our first time using them, figuring out the syntax proved to be more difficult than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of implementing Socket.io into the website, which allows the user to talk with companies about the jobs they have applied for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much more about the Laravel framework, and also how to implement APIs. This was quite exciting because now we know how to do this in the future with other APIs along with Google's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hamilton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hamilton is almost ready to be deployed to the market, with a couple more hours of work this project could make it to the internet sometime soon!
