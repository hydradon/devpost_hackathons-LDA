                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no idea on what to do so we came up with this idea.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Unity 5 with Vuforia and Google Cardboard.

                <p>
                    Vuforia's outdated guide. Unity 5's new features.

                    The build process was (maybe) successful (at least)!
