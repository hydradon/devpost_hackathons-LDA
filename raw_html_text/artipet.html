                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got out inspiration from the old Tamagachi devices that used to be around. We thought it would be a cool idea to bring a more realistic version of that to our modern world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a brief description its a game that aims to connect the virtual world with the real world. It aims to spread health awareness by displaying pros and cons to doing certain activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app by focusing on in one platform, that platform being Android. But In order to achieve our goals of being able to join both the virtual world and real world, we had to use some stronger libraries to get information out of our surroundings. For that we used Google-Vision Api, which has many features to it. The feature we took advantage of was their labeling API. This API allowed us to categorize what the where looking at, such as junk food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest chalenges that we came across was that just recently Google has begun pushing out a smaller but yet powerful library for mobile development called MLKit . This recent addition and the fact that the libraries are fairly similarly added a good ammount of confusion and just in general some extra time that could have been used in other places towards further developing the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we are using a Google-Cloud API, and it has actually had success. The game in generall came out much better than what we expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't give up, google usually has some good documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ArtiPet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully continue improving it. Adding more definitions of what is health or may bring joy. Improve the character gameplay, add more pets to choose from.
