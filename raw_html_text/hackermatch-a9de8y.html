                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it easier for students attending a hackathon to find a team to work with at a hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A student can create a profile for themselves that includes the coding languages they know, coding languages that they don't know, and what level of competition they are seeking during the competition.  The user then will be able to search for team members by the parameters of their choice in order to create the team with the most compatibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the backend with Java and are planning to integrate the Java code into a slack app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent the first 3 hours of the hackathon with a totally different idea and ended up having to change ideas, java doesn't integrate well with Slack apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a button on the webpage, we were able to successfully integrate our app onto our slack team, we understand the logic involved in integrating the java code with the slack app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Version Control, more about java, more about webapps
                </p>
