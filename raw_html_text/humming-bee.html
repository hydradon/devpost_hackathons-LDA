                    Twitter is a great platform for connecting with people, however sometimes it can be time consuming and become a distraction. Humbee is designed to use augmented reality to view tweets around you.

                    Doing augmented reality work within iOS is ALOT easier than doing it in Unity and then porting it out to iOS
