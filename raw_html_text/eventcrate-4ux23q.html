                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dartmouth is home to many different student groups, sports teams, fraternities, sororities, clubs, bands, and more. With that many different student organizations, sometimes keeping up with the campus events listserv is outright impossible. That is why we wanted to build a website that could keep track of campus events in a more organized way that just the inbox of outlook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the website with two things in mind: simplicity and functionality. Eventcrate is an event management system that organizes Dartmouth campus events into a user-friendly calendar. It allows users to post and add events to the calendar which will be reviewed by an administrator before being added to the site. With the new format, students will be able to quickly see on what day and at what time each of the various events are happening, allowing them to easily see if they are available to attend. Furthermore, we wanted to help people find events they are interested in so we decided to allow user to filter events by tags, clubs, and time, further allowing students to customize the information they receive from the campus events listserv.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react, javascript, and mongo to build the front and back end of the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working on eventcrate and increase the analytical power of the application and further automate and integrate the website with the existing listserv framework.
