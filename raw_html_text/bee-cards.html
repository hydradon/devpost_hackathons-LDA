                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We send and receive paper cards all year long, but is the financial and environmental cost worth it? We enjoy the sentiment behind greeting cards but don't want to spend $5+ for every birthday, Valentine's Day, and Christmas only for the card to end up in a landfill or buried and forgotten in a desk drawer. We wanted to make Bee Cards to reduce waste while actually having a positive impact on global good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bee Cards is a subscription based app where you can send adorable ecards to your friends and family without breaking the bank. Users can sign up for a year of Bee Cards (that's 20 cards) for just $20. The average greeting card from a store will cost you around $4-$5, which would cost you about $80-$100! Plus, with Bee Cards, you get a cute environmentally friendly card to send that also supports a charitable cause. Each Bee Cards is associated with an organization that works toward social good, animal welfare, environmental efforts, and more, and a percentage of the proceeds from that Bee Card go directly to the cause.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used Sketch before, so I had to overcome a bit of a learning curve. Once I got the hang of it I was able to make icon and ecards! It is also significantly harder to come up with puns at 3am(:

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Although Daniel is a veteran hacker, this is my first Hackathon! I'm proud that I was able to help pull together a project for submission and learn a new skill in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use sketch which was so great, I could really see myself using it for many future projects. I also learned that people with completely different skills can work together to make something amazing.
