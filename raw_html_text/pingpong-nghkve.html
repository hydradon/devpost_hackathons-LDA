                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen in university, it's been difficult to meet people outside of extracurricular organizations.  Not everybody has the self-confidence to stride up to a person and get to know them, so we created an alternative method to meet new people and hang out with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user creates a
                    <strong>
                        Ping
                    </strong>
                    , they create a field around their location that contains up to five interests.  When another user goes within that area with the same interests, they are notified and have the option to
                    <strong>
                        Pong
                    </strong>
                    back, and see the location of the
                    <strong>
                        Ping
                    </strong>
                    , where they can then meet up with the original poster. After an hour, the
                    <strong>
                        Ping
                    </strong>
                    expires to prevent miscommunications.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS with Mongoose as a backend along with MongoDB for database storage, and Twilio for phone verification. For the front end, we used HTML5 and CSS3 and packaged the files using Phonegap for mobile use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First-time usage of the Twilio API proved to be a significant problem, as well as creating phone notifications using FireBase with Phonegap.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating a wide variety of services and APIs into an application for the first time is what we're most proud of, as well as learning how to create a multi-platform app.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        In terms of technical skills: Making an API server from scratch, as well as how to create a cross-platform app.

                    <li>
                        Non-technical skills: Communicating between client-side and server-side development.

                    <li>
                        Incorporating native push notifications was one of the challenges that we failed to overcome, and we'd like to solve that in the future.
