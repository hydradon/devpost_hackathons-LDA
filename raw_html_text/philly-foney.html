                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking personal expenses is very important as it is easy to overspend and to fall into debt. Budgeting is one of the biggest aspects of financial literacy and there are few tools available that create a budget tailor made for Philadelphia residents and that allow them to track their expenses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Web App allows users to enter their hourly wage and hours worked per week. We then ask them to enter how much they spend per week on categories like rent, food, transportation etc and then we provide them tips to save money in areas where they tend to overspend (or spend more than the average resident).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then provide them with a budget based on data we collected for livable wages in the Philadelphia area. After that, they can begin tracking their weekly expenses and we show them how much they have left to spend for the week in each category. We also give them the option to view their savings potential for the week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feature that we added is allowing users to share financial tips for other users to view and benefit from. This would be extremely helpful as the tips will be specific to Philadelphia residents.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build our Web App. We tried using Firebase as the database but did not have the time to. We also did plenty of research to find Philadelphia-specific income/spending data.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it would be beneficial for each of us to master or learn how one database service/platform works. We also need to work on improving our Javascript skills.

                    What's next for Philly Foney
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement user authentication and a database system at the minimum. We want to make our web app more interactive and fun with a variety of graphics. We also plan on adding a financial literacy game to the website.
