                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think back to the worst flight experience you've ever had. Either you were bored out of your mind, or the talkative guy next to you wouldn't let you enjoy some much-needed quiet. We're looking to solve both of those issues in one go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think back to when you filled out your roommate compatibility survey before moving into your college dorm. We're seeking to create a similar (or better!) complementarity in each and every customer's flight experience. A user fills out a survey with some preferences, and do some behind-the-scenes work to put them with someone similar!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We used firebase for the webhosting and the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interacting with firebase was a lot harder than we expected, and a lot of time was sunk into tinkering around with that. Also, none of us had very much experience using Javascript (or much web programming at all!) and that caused a pretty steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all became more familiar with HTML and Javascript, and hope to build on these skills in the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how the frontend, backend, and server all interconnect to produce quality applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plane Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to refine our algorithm to help create a finished product, as well as implement neural networks to allow for more options (e.g. preferred conversation topic) and optimally place the "talkers" among their section of the plane.
