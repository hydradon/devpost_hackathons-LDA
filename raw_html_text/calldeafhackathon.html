                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest barrier to personal finance is knowledge. This prompted us to convey financial information through calling, completely accessible from a wired phone without even a screen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This application is completely accessible through a phone call. Without the need of an internet connection, keep up to date with your favorite stock (and options) with this pleasant voice bot!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The call platform was built using Twilio. Flask was used in conjunction with it to send HTTP data from the local server to call platform. Python was used to query and process data from various APIs, such as Yahoo Finance and Aladdin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with Twilio, so we learned a great deal about what we couldn't modify during calls. Additionally, the financial jargon limited our ability to make full use of the Aladdin API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project came together well, considering our expectations coming into this as mostly-inexperienced hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logistics is key, especially when there are only 36 hours in a hackathon (including sleeping and fire drills). Sadly, 4 people working for 36 hours doesn't mean we can do 4*36 = 144 hours of work.
