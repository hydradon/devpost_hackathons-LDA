                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a bubble tea lounge next to me in my hometown. They had a cute little chalkboard set up where you could draw pictures or leave your friend's phone number for any lucky guys and gals. It was a sad day when the lounge decided to take that chalkboard down. There wasn't any reason given just a deep sense of fleeting sadness towards days gone by in my heart. I wanted to bring that chalkboard back, but on a larger scale. Now no matter where we go, we'll find our bubble tea lounge chalkboard and a beautiful nostalgia.

                <p>
                    Interacts with Google Maps API to display the user in real time. The user will be able to interact with points of interest near him/her whether that be local businesses or natural landmarks. In their interactions they will be able to draw pictures locally and upload them to be associated with the point of interest they are at, or view drawings that have been uploaded previously at the aforementioned point of interest. They will be able to vote on favorite drawings and see who posted what.

                    GoogleMaps API - all location based functionality. getting location in real time and registering what is considered a point of interest.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was difficulty with regards to database schema and an effective way to efficiently store user and location information whilst tying these points to drawing data. We resolved these after much trial and error and believe we have a relatively scalable and minimal database schema.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was difficulty implementing a browsing view. Drawings were not scaling well and a traditional android ListView was not at all aesthetically pleasing. We resolved this through the discovery of the amazing Picasso framework and a much needed tutorial on the use of ViewPagers.

                <p>
                    Two of our team members had never done Android Development in their life! After a quick crash course and some frustration they were off hacking at it with the best of them. Watching the team pick up new technologies and smashing together frameworks in a timely manner was extremely inspiring.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't plan on stopping here! There is still a lot of functionality we would like to add and UI polishings that could go a long way! With time allowing we have full intentions to make this much more scalable and an overall more refined product. Keep an eye out and don't be afraid to Drawp by!
