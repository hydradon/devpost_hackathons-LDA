                    We were hungry and didn't know where to find the food we were hungry for. That's what started Love @ the Ratty. Usually, in order to find what food you're craving you have to take about 20 minutes to scroll through the Brown app or dining services website and look through the many menus of each dining hall. Then, once you decide where you want to eat you'd have to text your friends if they also wanted to eat at the same place, which usually results in compromises about where to eat. We wanted to fix this problem by creating a website where a simple quiz would tell you the best dining option on campus to find the food you're craving. Then, after finding out which dining hall you wanted to go to, you could share your results in our Facebook group to see who else is going to the same dining hall. Through this website we hope to help people meet new friends and create a sense of community through food. 
All four of us are new to programming. We built our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which we each had to learn from scratch. In the future, we hope to implement new features to our website, including expanding our quiz to restaurants on Thayer for those who are off meal plan or who are tired of the dining halls, and update our quiz to display live updates of the menus of the dining halls to get a more accurate match. We hope you find our website easy to use and accessible!
