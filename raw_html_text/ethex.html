                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create an easily accessible way of exchanging cryptocurrency in a peer-to-peer fashion.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listing of cryptocurrency offerings and ability to transact with a listing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Solidity to develop a smart contract, then used a react app to run the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tutorials used were based on older versions of Solidity and did not work with the most recent edition - had to do a lot of searching on Stack Overflow.
                </p>
