                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game since we are beginners with programming, and we only know Java. We all liked the idea of a simple, yet addicting mobile game, but we lack the knowledge of mobile development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A randomly colored ball spawns and drops at a certain speed from the top of the screen. The user's input from the keyboard selects the colors of the bar at the bottom of the screen. If the color of the ball and the bar match, the user will get a point. If not, the user loses a life. As the player earns more points, the ball moves faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each installed the IDE Eclipse and setup a plugin that allowed us to work on the project at the same time on our individual computers. We programmed in Java because we all are familiar with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphics in Java are rather difficult, and our lack of knowledge of how Java uses those graphics forced us to adapt and make things work how we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created graphics and animation along with the ability to listen fro user input from the keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java is not great for beginner game development or graphics, and some teamcode plugins are not very stable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spectrum Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, we will pick it back up one day as we progress in our skills
