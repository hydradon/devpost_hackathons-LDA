                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice and neat if you could easily advertise your Github repos to all your friends with neat stickers for Snapchat.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This API takes your GitHub repo information, and it displays and transforms it into a sticker for Snapchat users.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this with Java in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapkit has no beginner documentation and no example apps for Android.
There were only 3-4 GitHub repos that attempted to use Snapkit for Android.
Snapchat doesn't display its errors to its API calls.
Snapkit would not work for me.
We have never used Android Studio, so we had zero idea what we were doing.
The error trace in Android more often than not came back with a runtime error, but didnt link itself to my code so we couldn't narrow down bugs that made the app crash.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an android app that accesses the GitHub API
                </p>

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Android Studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for Snappo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully to get a redo and to get Snapkit fully integrated for android and maybe ios.
