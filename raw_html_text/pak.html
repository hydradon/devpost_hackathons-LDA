                    Thanksgiving is a holiday for a family to get together and bond. Unfortunately, in arguably the most polarized political climate ever in the history of this great country, Thanksgiving has become a time where you meet distant relatives who spew vitriol rhetoric on the dinner table. What was once the great American holiday has been reduced to an ideological battleground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What happened? What radicalized and emboldened once pleasant and demure relatives to spew divisive words? Some studies have concluded that the exposure of fake and biased news via Facebook and other social media platforms have contributed to this phenomenon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus the problem at hand. We cannot control which articles people click and open. However, what if we could identify articles which are potentially biased and fake, and replace, without the users knowledge, the contents of such articles. Thus, Pak! the fake news destroyer was born.
