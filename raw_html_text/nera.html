                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, thriftiness is a necessity. However, we still desire to go to places that would provide a recuse from the mundane day to day and homework. A vacation to Europe or Asia sounds wonderful, but those require large sums of money that we do not have. So we decided to make an application that would give the customer the full package: a flight, a room, and attractions, all in one user-friendly website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows the user to choose a departure date, return date, and which airport they desire to take off from. Along with this, the user can choose to have a link to their reservation sent to their phone so they know the details of their flight.
                </p>

                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the first challenges we ran into was splitting the workload. As all of our team members were green to hackathons, we had difficulty establishing a methodology for getting the project done. However, we then brainstormed and were able to split the project into three mostly even workloads, based on past experience and ability to grow in that assigned field. There were a few programming roadblocks in the front end as well as a lack of prior knowledge, but nothing that could not be fixed with time and a Google search or two. On the backend, the inner workings of node.js and it being asynchronous presented multiple roadblocks, that with review and debugging were cleared. Unfamiliarity with APIs also was part of the problem and while an easier implementation of the API was found in the end, it took trials with more difficult parts of the API in order to find the best solution to our case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all feel that we have expanded our coding knowledge and ability to find information online after today. Our lack of prior knowledge, in tandem with a need to make a product, led to our overall growth as programmers. Much to our surprise, we were able to develop something that we are proud to show to judges. Since we all came in new, we expected the worst, especially since there were two other groups which we were friendly with who struggled more than us. In the end, even though the final project is less than our ambitions, it still exceeded our expectations.

                    We expanded our knowledge of full-stack programming, user experience, tools, and APIs

                    In the future, we would like to implement the AirBnB, attraction, and final booking page in order to complete our original ambitions.
