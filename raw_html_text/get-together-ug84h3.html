                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went into this project with the goal of making it easier for people to connect.  Each of us have ran into the problem of having an issue of setting a time to get together.  We decided to tackle an issue that we ourselves faced, while expanding it to serve any community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project scrapes data from the users' google calendar, then adds each member's calendar data and events to a real-time firebase database.  Users can then create events with a specified length, and it provides the nearest date when all group members have time to attend, and allows for the option to send an email with an event to members of a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app with a html, css, and javascript frontend with firebase as our datastorage.  We used the google calendar api to scrape event data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had solid experience with javascript or firebase, so it was a struggle setting up the data base while implementing google's API service.  There was a tremendous learning curve from start to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to correctly employ the google calendar api while also successfully storing the desired data into a database of which we had no knowledge beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Get Together
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on tweaking Get Together and making the website a more finished project.  Each of us want to learn more about full-stack web development, and so will use the project as a continued learning experience.
