                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes student's Facebook posts in order to tell if they are likely to commit suicide, commit violent crimes, or otherwise deviate from normal student behavior.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using many different Python libraries, which we put together on Jupyter notebook. Libraries include keras, nltk (Natural Language ToolKit), Pandas, and Numpy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to find a labeled dataset of sentences with their respective sentiment, but we were unable to get good results using a deep neural network. Instead we used the natural language toolkit in order to analyze a phrase's sentiment.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Facebook Text Sentiment Analysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will connect the offline portion (sentiment analysis) with the online portion (educators viewing student's levels of happiness, depression, sadness, etc.)
