                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PrarieLearn as a testing system is very efficient. However, as with all good things, there is always a deficiency. This system does not have a GradeBook to view your grades after you're done with your assessments. This proves quite frustrating to the creators. We know a lot of peers who echo this sentiment too. Hence, I started working on this GradeBook that should be an essential part of any academic testing suite.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GradeBook is an efficient way to view your grades on all the assessments you have done on PrairieLearn.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with the maintainers of this project at HackIllinois 2018, in order to learn the the build details of the project and get it set up.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us really knew either javascript or SQL. However, with the help of our amazing mentors and some messing around with the code environment, we were able to build a proof of concept GradeBook.

                    Accomplishments that we were proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worked on a big codebase with languages and technologies we were never exposed to before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with new languages on the fly, and a bit of knowledge about javascript and sql.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GradeBook for PrairieLearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the interface more intuitive and beautiful. We also want to make the interface fully customizable so instructors can use it as their courses primary gradebook.
