                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I trying to search for a restaurant on yelp, I have to type something to search bar and when I am busy doing something else, it would not allow me to do that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives out restaurant recommendations based on user preference (such as type of food and zip code) through voice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a command-line interface  that allows users to interact through voice(like Amazon Alexa) and finds restaurants
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a hard time testing it because it is very crowded in here and the voice recognition could not hear clearly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives us the result we want and it could benefit many people in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Google Cloud Speech-to-Text is very useful for NLP
                </p>

                    We are going to convert it to an iOS application
