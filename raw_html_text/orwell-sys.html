                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently taking a cyber security class and is has made me become more conscious of how I treat the personal data I have on my devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors the user's system. It will take screenshots of the desktops, log keystrokes, take webcam photos and constantly upload them to a remote server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code is pure Python. With the use of MANY modules to increase the efficiency of the program so that it would be less detectable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multi-threading. I have never implemented multiple threads into one program so I ran into some segmentation faults and it provided plenty of frustration, but I was able to get past it and now I fully understand how the whole process works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a set list of features I wanted to implement in the program and I was able to implement them all. I was even able to do it in less time than I had originally estimated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Dropbox API and I also learned how to perform multi-threading techniques to improve code efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Orwell.Sys
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on adding features to document when a user changes their window focus and I would like to develop it well enough to show the key strokes in a better format. One feature I want to work on is facial recognition so that the pictures taken help the program identify who it is they are looking at.
