                <p>
                    One of my senior and the brain behind precisely visited 20 Countries, attended 14 International Conferences, 2 got International Fellowships, gave 7 Research Paper Presentations across the Globe, and bagged 5 International Awards, and made 379 Friends from 113 countries and a thousand good memories! All that at the age of 20 without even spending a dime!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now he wasn't presented with opportunities on his plate, neither did he ever think in his high school that this is what it's gonna look like after three years. Well, then what was his secret, of how he achieved this small but memorable feat. The secret is, there are scores of opportunities available on the web and he put in a lot of screen time and research efforts to find the right one.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill was built in NodeJS on AWS Lambda using AWS Dynamo DB as Database. There is also a php based backend which the Alexa Skill connects to for getting the data which is generated from our machine learning, data analytics, and deep neural networks which cater to personalized feeds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Finding quality content and connecting Alexa skill to the android application. Also, Use of state handlers perfectly has always been one of the toughest tasks in Alexa Development and this skill heavily depends on state handlers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an Alexa skill which I will be using myself daily.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with state handlers is always a new challenge.

                <p>
                    Most applications or websites in the market simply provide a huge database of opportunities where the user has to filter through categories, browse through 100s of random opportunities and still may not be able to find the right one. On these platforms, the people who post these opportunities are also not very sure if they will be able to reach the right audience.
We will be adding more languages to our platform and make our backend more intuitive and efficient.
