                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To write code hands free when we are too tired to keep our eyes open at hackathons and to provide others with more interesting ways to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WitCoder allows you to turn speech into code with any text editor of your choosing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented WitCoder with Python and various open-source libraries. Pyaudio allowed us to record our speech into an audio file which is then used by the Wit.ai library. Wit uses several AI strategies to understand and find context in our words! After Wit does its analysis, our software is provided with important information such as the user wanting to create a function, variable, parameters, or a for loop. Wit learns over time so the more its output is validated the better it gets at understanding the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to create a plugin for sublime for a more seamless implementation but sublime ran into problems with recognizing our package dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we didn't implement every Python feature, we were able to create a project that recognizes the user voice and translate it to code for a subset of Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Appreciate software that can recognize libraries and package dependencies within the same directory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WitCoder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has a lot of potential. We were only able to scratch the surface of what this project could do. Providing this project to the open source community would serve to be both interesting and fun for those involved. There are endless possibilities on how this project could be expanded on and we would love to see others contribute.
As poetically said by Wit itself "is it true function call will be all?"
