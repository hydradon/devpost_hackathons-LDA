                    What inspired me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always had times when I was bored, and I was wondering what to do. Especially if you have no siblings, you would want someone to talk to time to time. I thought of what children these days like to play. That is how I got the game Pokemon Battle. Gypsy was inspired by my friends. They wrote yes, no and maybe on a eraser, asked a question and threw it to see what the answer was. There was no official name for the game, so I thought of Gypsy, a book character that can tell the future. Fortune teller was just a game we thought of. We always get fortunes from fortune cookies, but this is a way to just get it right away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our arcade entertains children under the age of 13. It also helps kids escape boredom and it will grow the mind of creativity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this for Amazon Alexa. You can simply just start by saying "Alexa, open Arcade Susie Hannah."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It includes three games; Gypsy, Fortune Teller, and Pokemon Battle. Gypsy is a game where you can ask a specific question, and Alexa will answer with a yes, no or a maybe. Fortune Teller opens when you say "give me my fortune." Then, Alexa will give you your fortune. Lastly, Pokemon Battle is a game where you can ask Alexa for your opponent and your next steps will be given. There are different choices you can make, and your story will unravel depending on your choices. Make sure to try them all! You also have the choice to play again after each game. Further instructions will be given once you play the game.
