                    Lifecard is a solo project which I finished during the Montclair State University's Hackathon. The idea promises to provide an individual's health information to any doctor, physician, and ER specialist with the swipe of their Lifecard. 
Example of a real-world scenario: 
#Patient is taken or attends a health care organization for a health issue. Either major or minor health issue. 
(For example, consider a scenario where the User is rushed to the hospital due to blood loss from a bad motorcycle accident. 
#Upon reaching the ER, the physician asks the patient for their blood type and asks for any allergies to medication the patient might have. 
 #The patient has no idea about their blood type or any allergies they might have. Maybe to peanuts they reply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following scenario slows down the process of getting the help an individual may need quick as possible. And this issue is not only in hospitals but also in primary care physicians where first-time patients have to fill out 20-30-minute forms and wait in line for others all the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let&rsquo;s remove this wait time and introduce Lifecard. Lifecard acts as a credit card that can be swiped at any health care organization and our servers will read the encrypted key on the card and provide the health care physician to view the patient&rsquo;s health data such as height, weight, allergies, blood type, current medications they are taking, past doctor visits, tests, vaccines they've taken and much more. Not only will this help the physicians speed up their patient intake, but this small idea can even save lives where some situations require no time being wasted and knowing the patient&rsquo;s history is crucial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steps on how it works:
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Primary physician or doctor logs-in to our online website.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    The doctor swipes the Lifecard of the patient who's in our files with a card reader.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    The doctor is given an option to read the users health history, or update it regarding their appointment/visit.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    The doctor choose the view health card and is taken to a page with the patients health history.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                    The patients also have the option to log-into our online website, but they can only view the Lifecard and are restricted from updating any data.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Coding process: 
To start with the project dose not have a card reader, as the idea came to me after I was already at the Hackathon therefor a random value generator will be used to perform the actions of the card reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code is made using local-host xampp server. After writing hundreds of lines of front end and back end of the code, the final product dose what it should when I first imagined it about 20 hours ago.  (Not including the card reader).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future exploration: 
Lifecard can not only be used for helping patients and doctors but it can also be used by researchers and scientists to network and find link between diseases. Since Lifecard would be a collection of individual health data that tracks symptoms, tests, diseases, allergies, and more it can be used for multiple data mining studies. There are so many possibilities with this small idea that can truly help save someone's life.
