                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When our first project idea fell through, we decided to just set our sights on something simpler and build from there. Because none of us are artists, we knew our sprites would be simple and decided to use that to our advantage. So, we have GeoCrawl.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoCrawl is a simplistic 2D platformer using simple shapes with different powers. The base shape, the square, has more mobility than the other shapes and has a double jump to help explore the game. The triangle is used to deflect the lasers shot at the player. And the circle is the smallest form and can explore small spaces to move the player forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using GameMaker Studio 2 and the GML language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us are here for the first time at eHacks, so the biggest challenge we had was learning to not bite off more than we could chew. Our first idea was to learn a whole new environment and develop a mod for a pre-existing game. After spending a majority of the first night without any real progress being made, we readjusted and fell to an environment that was more friendly for new learners. GameMaker Studio 2 was much easier to pick up for those in our group that had never used it before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're most proud of being able to make the call early on to change the plan for the weekend. If we had spent too long on the first idea, then we would have already been so invested that a change would have been less feasible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start small, and grow from there. Starting with a big idea and no clue where to start is not the position you want to be in for a 40-hour code session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoCrawl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next would be a fully fleshed out game, one with better sprites and more challenges to overcome. As it stands, we have a fun little adventure, but the ideal would be to have a vast sprawling castle that the player would have to adventure through.
