                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration is what this app speaks, we wanted to allow the user to use their curiosity of the objects around them to dive deeper into how everything around is involved somehow with STEM
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an image recognition application that recognizes an object and suggests resources/ videos to examine in order to learn more about that item and how it relates to STEM
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built in NATIVE android and we implemented an api to perform image recognition
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    integrating the amazon rekognition sdk into the android studio development environment was tough
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were finally able to perform object recognition and using the response of the object we displayed resources/ video for the user to learn more about the topic and hows it's made
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create user friendly android applications that can implement the camera and take pictures as well as have callbacks to load the youtube API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEMifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has to become gamified, this means keeping track of which items a user takes pictures of in order to give them points and therefore use these points to see which fields interest them the most within STEM
                </p>
