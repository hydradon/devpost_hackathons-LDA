                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We try to build a productivity app add first with Android studio but unfortunately, we don't have enough experience and time for it yet. So we stop at the timer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a timer that user can set time as an alarm and the flower will grow during the time. When time is up the flower will stop growing and there will be some happy music come with it.
