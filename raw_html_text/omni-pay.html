                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fusion Digital Front Office, is a digital banking solution where executives of the bank can service customers outside of branches. They can take the bank to the customer's convenience, anytime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us consider the scenario.. Anupama, an employee of Finastra, holds a bank account with Wells Fargo. I, Shemeer, a customer service executive of Bank of America is on a marketing campaign at Finastra.  I meet with Anupama and realizes she is interested in certificate of deposits. I make her an offer to give her a preferred rate of 3.5% for a 24 months CD where as Wells Fargo&rsquo;s rate is 3%. Anupama is interested, but to fund the new account, the only option FDFO provides now is to use customer&rsquo;s credit card. Or walk into the branch next day and make a cash payment, which is not a good user experience.

                    There was a recent post (15 Dec 2019 in economic times -
"Google has written to the US Federal Reserve Board detailing the successful example of UPI-based digital payment in India in order to build "FedNow" -- a new interbank real-time gross settlement service (RTGS) for faster digital payments in the US"

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a bundled package of various funding options, including google pay, apple pay, pay pal, alipay etc., where I can open an account for Anupama, and have that funded with her google pay account, which debits from her Wells Fargo account and credit her new account instantly.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was build using AngularJS version 8, Google Pay API and AP.NET Core Web API along with 2 APIs from FFDC
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting with Google API from our code base took some time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Participation, Team quickly consumed FFDC API, Learned Google Pay integration
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have consumed FFDC API for Customer Profile and Account Listing and also integrated Google Pay API for testing purpose in Fusion Digital Front Office - Funding
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Omni Pay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have made this proposal in line with Finastra Mission 2021 strategy, Our proposed solution is to offer various options such as google pay, apple pay, paypal , remote deposit capture and same day ach funding for external transfers and internal transfers, for funding purposes. For internal transfer since we have FFDC API - For other payment options, we propose to contribute the APIs to FFDC, so that FDFO and uOpen and any other account opening products can readily consume the package.
