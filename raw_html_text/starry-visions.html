                        NASA Space Log from the Starry Visions Team [09.15.2018. 15:32]:
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        1. Inspiration:
                    </strong>
                    We are space fanatics and nerds who believe in the importance of providing accessible STEM education to the public.
                    <strong>
                        2. What it does:
                    </strong>
                    It allows users to learn about constellations with immersive and engaging technology.
                    <strong>
                        3. How we built it:
                    </strong>
                    Platform was built using Unity, Google VR (Google Cardboard), Visual Studio and C#.
                    <strong>
                        4. Challenges we ran into:
                    </strong>
                    We struggled with implementing on screen button clicking with Google Cardboard.
                    <strong>
                        5. Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                    </strong>
                    We are beginners with very little coding knowledge. However, in the given time we were able to create a full VR environment from scratch.
                    <strong>
                        6: What we learned:
                    </strong>
                    This was our first time using any of the technologies in this project. Within approximately 24 hours we were able to gain enough knowledge in Unity and C# to create a functional product.
                    <strong>
                        7. What's next for Starry Visions:
                    </strong>
                    We would like to implement several game options within this app as well as expand to iOS devices. We would also like to expand beyond constellations and add planets, stars, etc.
