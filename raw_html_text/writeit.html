                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We find printing QR codes or barcodes for packages to be really annoying, especially when we don't own a printer. What if we could handwrite a phrase or word and send it to a database. When someone else (the mailman perhaps) wanted to see where it should go, he/she scans the phrase/word, which links them to the full address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to scan a handwritten image and attach a link to it. Other users can then scan the same image and open that same link.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using Android Studio. The backend is done using Java and the front end and backend is connected using PHP and MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front end and back end was very tricky. Also, dealing with image processing especially for handwritten items was very tricky. Lastly, android programming was not very cooperative.
                </p>

                    We build an app which sorta-kinda work.
