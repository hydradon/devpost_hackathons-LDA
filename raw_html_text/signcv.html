                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the live translation of spoken languages by the pixel earbuds and wanted to implement a similar feature for gestural languages as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It take feed from a webcam, sends it to a server, which extracts and interprets a hand gesture, then prints it to text. We currently have ASL letter gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the TensorFlow and Keras APIs to perform image recognition, and OpenCV to extract the hand gesture from a video feed. We tried to used Google Cloud Platform to facilitate model training using GPU acceleration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dataset we had was extremely large, but only contained a few people's hands. We found the model often began overfitting to a few limited values. Furthermore, we were unable to perfectly merge the frontend and backend, preventing the translated information to be pushed back to the website.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a live video processor/extractor.

                    What's next for signCV
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to train the model using a larger, more varied dataset.
