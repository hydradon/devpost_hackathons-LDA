                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were astonished to see the problems in the supply chain of lifesaving drugs which are so important for any patient and the amount of counterfeit drugs being supplied.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A DECENTRALIZED APP 'PHARMACHAIN' THAT SCANS THE
PRODUCT'S BARCODE TRACE BACK ITS ORIGIN AND DETECT
ANY FRAUD OR COUNTERFEITING OF THE PRODUCT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using open ethereum blockchain network where we deployed a smart contract for detecting the anomaly in supply chain and also we use the simple barcode reader which is present in all the mobiles these days. Basically we have made our platform on an application which is easy to use for a layman.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was time constraint and the integration of front end with back end As it was a local hack day so we had so less time to do all this stuff.
