                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we study we always tend to get distracted by our phone and end up using our phone more than we even study.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LockBlock encourages students to ignore their phones while they study. If you decide to pickup your phone, it will wail out a siren, flash its light, and vibrate uncontrollably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built LockBlock with Android Studio utilizing programming languages Java and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to implement functionality for the android's standard home key button, this is a major caveat as we wanted to completely prevent the user from using any other application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how the Android API works as well as the basics of creating a brand new Android app. For some of us, this was our first Android app that we ever made or worked on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LockBlock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on linking this to Facebook in order for users to compete and show their results with their friends. Users can show how many times they have picked up their phone while studying and compare with their friends as well as hopefully have a timer to show how long they studied for non stop before having to pick up their phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also planning on implementing this as a security feature linked with the Pebble Watch too sometime down the line where if the phone is too far from the pebble, the alarm will go off so the owner will know where it is at all times.
