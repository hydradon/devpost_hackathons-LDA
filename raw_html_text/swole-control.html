                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're an all freshman squad on the varsity fencing team. One of our members, Finn, used to be called "Skinny Finny" or "Thin Finn" in middle school. Upon coming to college, he resolved to get big. After talking to the Duke nutritionist, he was told to track what he is eating in a notebook and using the MyFitnessPal app. However, both writing things into a notebook and typing into the MyFitnessPal app is clunky and out of the way for a busy D1 student athlete. We decided to help him out on his quest to get big with Swole Control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swole Control tracks what you eat and gives back nutrition facts for each individual item that you eat and a running total of what you consumed throughout the day. This is more convenient because you can go home and tell your google home what you have eaten, or if you're not at home, you can use the mic function on the google home app, or type an input into the Swole Control app and it will do the same thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialogflow to make a program that takes inputted food and returns nutrition facts. We used firebase to store the data in a database on the cloud. We use google home as a means to deliver the inputted foods to Dialogflow and then google home returns the output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used Dialogflow, Firebase, or Google Home before and none of the mentors could really help us, because they had never used those programs before either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program works and is super convenient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Dialogflow, Firebase, and Google Home on the spot and used them to make a functioning program which Finn now uses everyday to get big.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swole Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swole Control is horizontally scaleable, so we can take our program and make it work across platforms, such as Alexa, Cortana, and Siri.
