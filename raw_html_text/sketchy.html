                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After listening to numerous complaints from our families and cousins getting hacked and downloading malicious software because of seemingly-legitimate web links, we have decided to put an end to it. Using Sketchy, we no longer have to worry about links before we click on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does: a chrome extension that monitors for malicious links in popular human-to-human social platforms. Using Cymon's API, it checks for fishy links and allows users to report a threat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sketchy was implemented in the form of a Chrome extension. We utilised web-scraping to get possible dangerous links by looking at high-risk areas not covered by other web-security software. These include Facebook messenger and the gmail inbox. We sent these to a node backend which would analyse the risk of these links, mainly by using the cymon api v2. The results would be sent back to the front end and display a warning to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our efforts to protect users, we had to overome
tracking evasive redirections to a final domain without touching any of its contents.
We created a spam prevention filtering system for our domain reporting system as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cymon's API, creating a Chrome extension, web scraping social networks, creating REST APIs, Firebase, some of us gained the experience of working in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sketchy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sketchy could be improved by handling JavaScript redirects, and improving the cymon database by completing the reporting feature of the extension. Our vision is to detect faulty emails from different domains.
