                    Why we need XtraServings:
A.      40% of the food in the U.S that is grown, processed, or cooked is thrown away each year
B.      That equals $165 billion of food that is routed to landfills
C.      According to a report by National Resources Defense Council, the average American throws away 20 pounds of food a month
D.      According to USDA figures, At the same time 50 million people do not have consistent access to adequate food because of a lack of money &amp; other resources at times during the year making them food insecure.
E.       There are currently 15 million households that are food insecure on a nightly bases
F.       According to Feeding America 1 in 6 Americans go hungry every night before bed
G.     At some point during 2015 1 in 4 Americans relied on some sort of federal government food assistance program
H.      All of that wasted food creates a host of environmental problems growing the size of landfills and contributing to climate change. Organic matter rotting in dumps is the third largest source of carbon monoxide emissions in the U.S. Chronic exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning can cause persistent headaches, lightheadedness, depression, confusion, memory loss, nausea and vomiting
