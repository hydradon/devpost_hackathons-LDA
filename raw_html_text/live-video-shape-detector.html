                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn how to use Opencv to process data from a live video feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opens the users video feed and scans the feed for basic shapes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++ and Opencv
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Canny function posed some issues with framerate which was easily solved by lowering the max value
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of overlaying a colored outline over discovered shapes on top of the live video feed (rather than opening a secondary window to display them) while maintaining a smooth framerate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use opencv to process images (specifically live video feed)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Live Video Shape Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly add more shapes. We have also been considering another project using the things we learned in this project with opencv.
