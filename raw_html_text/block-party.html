                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for the game came from a psychology lecture, where the professor described an experiment intended to test creativity. Research participants were presented with a mix of shapes and letters, and were asked to create a scene or object from these shapes. We thought this concept was quite fun, and decided to create it in an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Block Party allows users to compete against each other in a game of creativity. Players are randomly assigned the same set of shapes, and must move, scale, rotate, and color them in order to create a meaningful object or scene. At the end of the time limit, players can enter a brief explanation of their creation, and then view and rate the creations of all the other players. The player with the most points at the end of the voting wins!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app is built with Swift, the backend is built with python and flask, and the server is hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; Pusher turned out to be more difficult to implement than we anticipated.
                    <br>
                    &bull; Allowing users to adjust the shapes presented a variety of issues. We came up with multiple working solutions, but ended up using the simplest method of direct manipulation.
                    <br>
                    &bull; AWS was quite difficult to set up for a variety of reasons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that we were able to create a functioning app in such a short period of time! We didn't get to fully implement nearly all the ideas we had, but we were able to get the basics working well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about prioritization. We couldn't get everything done, so we had to make cuts to certain aspects of the project because fully implementing them would have taken too long. A good example of this was a real-time collaboration feature between users, where they could create a single scene together. The back-end for this process was completed about half way through the event, but we soon realized that the front-end challenges were too great for the time remaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Block Party
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to add features to the game, adding new shapes, colors, and collaboration options.
