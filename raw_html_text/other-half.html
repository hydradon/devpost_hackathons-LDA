                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matchmaking has been unfortunate for many, but with "Other Half," in-depth Facebook profile analysis can identify someone's personality type to find the right mentor or peer to work with, maximizing one's potential and productivity. This personalized matchmaking is not on appearance or interests alone and instead by who you actually are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through Facebook profile analysis, OtherHalf identifies your personality type and matches you with someone whose company you will enjoy.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript were learnt and used. We figured out how to use the Facebook api and sdk to retrieve a person's profile information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API that analyzes one's profile image and personality type from one's profile was either not free or too difficult to implement within the time we were hacking. Additionally, Facebook takes time to review and approve whether our website's request for certain information like likes is acceptable. However, we did our best!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us learned HTML and built the website from scratch within 24 hours; another figured out how to retrieve and use information from one's Facebook profile through their api and sdk.

                    Implementation of an image analysis api to go through all one's Facebook profile images and get descriptive traits as well as a Myers-Briggs personality type retrieval based on Facebook history and text analysis.
