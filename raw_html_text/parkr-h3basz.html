                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While thinking about the troubles of our daily life, parking is one of the biggest obstacles that we face in a seamless, interconnected society. It takes much time to find a parking spot, and we always have to rush back to our car to add more money to the meter if we have to stay longer. We were thinking of solutions to make the process of parking and paying, and we came up with Parkr.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parkr offers a sustainable solution that not only finds available parking spots but also eliminates the need of having to go and pay at a parking meter by automating the process entirely. It will also allows you to worry less about unforeseen circumstances such as vehicle theft, natural disasters, auto insurance claims and other causes as there is a live video feed that is maintaining the safety of your vehicle.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of our programmers were experts in front-end, it was a challenge for us to develop the interface of the app, along other challenges in machine learning, since finding a good database to train our data was fairly difficult.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was a challenge for all of us, and the scope that we have set was very wide. Every one have put out their best efforts to accomplish his task.
