                    Inspiration The super rich have access to data that the everyday person could only dream of. We are looking to bridge that gap between the super rich and the everyday person.

                <h2>
                    How I built it  We host the website on Microsoft Azure. From there we handle data requests by accessing the Wolfram Language from a cloud-deployed API. The Wolfram code imports data from sources like Twitter and the New York Times, performs analysis on it, and formats that data optimally for display on the website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into  Authenticating with OAuth from Mathematica proved to be extremely challenging. While Mathematica has some interfacing with Twitter, it is extremely limited and cannot handle the types of queries we wanted executed. We were forced to manually construct OAuth tokens using Undocumented Mathematica syntax.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of  We are proud of the sleek look of the front end, as well as the actual analytic power behind the engine.

                <h2>
                    What I learned  The Wolfram Language is far more powerful than we had anticipated. It is more than simply a tool for mathematicians and scientists-- it is a powerful and broadly applicable language in its own right.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Analyzr   In the future we would like to implement even more analytic capability. This comes in the form of deeper analysis of tweets, as well as possible integration with Facebook and Google APIs.
