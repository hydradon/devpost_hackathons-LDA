                <p>
                    We wanted to develop a viable solution for locking valuables securely, without the hassle of punching a number in. The Q-Lock system also has the added security and convenience of constantly changing QR codes. This was accomplished using RSA Encryption and comparing timestamps to ensure the the variation in QR codes, in Python. In order to make the physical component, we used a servo with corrugated metal for extra durability, and connected it to an Arduino board. For ease of access, we also added LED lights to indicate whether it is open or close and a push button to close the lock after use. However, the building process was not easy; we ran into many obstacles such as the limitations of the Raspberry Pi processing speed, as well as the compatibility between Python and Arduino, and the complications of the wiring process on the Arduino Board. We also had trouble with the building process, and fitting all of the components into the box, keeping in mind functionality, and aesthetics. After much work, the Arduino Board and the QR Code Scanner functioned properly together. During this process, we all learned how to interact with the Python and Arduino languages more efficiently.Our goal is to develop Q-Lock into a functional product that is more robust and physically stronger than our prototype, using higher quality materials than were available to us.
