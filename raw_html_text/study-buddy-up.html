                    Inspiration -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project stemmed from being shy and finding it difficult to find a study group - especially as a woman in CS because it can be difficult to feel a sense of belonging. I often thought about how great it would be if everyone in class shared when they were studying - so that there could be a stronger sense of community and increased academic success. Although this is built for everyone, underrepresented minorities in CS were our target demographic in mind.

                <h2>
                    What it does -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows students to post their study sessions (whether alone or with a group) in order to leave them open for others on campus to join. It also provides a couple of study resources to enhance user's studying experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the main webpage using HTML and CSS. We built a react app to add functionality to our forms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to configure our custom domain (apparently we need up to 24 hours?) and were unable to set up mongo db
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning new skills and relearning (very) old ones. Both of us had no recent experience with any tool we used today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to design a website from scratch! (And that we work well under pressure)
                </p>

                    What's next for Study Buddy Up!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mondo DB implementation!! We need a way for our web app to store study session information for others to view.
