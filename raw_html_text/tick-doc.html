                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We were just brainstorming going through inventory apps, looking for a twist and we were hit by inspiration. One of our team members gave a suggestion that he wanted to share information to his friends about his address but doesn't want it being saved because people these days do not delete text messages. Therefor, we wanted to create an app/webapp that allows us to share information with one another WITHOUT any traces of it later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is Easy, Fast and Uncluttered
There are two ways:-
1) Create a document
2) Set a time limit 
3) Randomly generated code is given and then you share!
                </p>
                <p>
                    OR
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Enter random generated code
2) Enjoy while it lasts.

                    <li>
                        Lack of time
-Amazon web services had some issues (Being nasty) 
-Considering that we had two members of our team who had minimal coding abilities, we could not distribute the work evenly as we'd like or contribute to the fullest
-We as a team were not familiar with PARSE etc prior to the competition. Through our vigorous research, we happen to stumble upon our saving grace
