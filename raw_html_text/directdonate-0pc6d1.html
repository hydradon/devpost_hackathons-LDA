                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to help people effected by natural disasters without using big charities that don't tell you how much of your money actually goes to the cause and how its even used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web application that allows users to chat victims of natural disasters, then they can choose to donate, directly in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used php and SQL,python for back-end and html, css and JavaScript for front-end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that we did not have enough time and connecting multiple APIs to our project was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create the front-end for the web app despite not having any prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate and gained more technical skills to use in front-end applications
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to be able to better integrate all our features into the website and improve the UI/UX
