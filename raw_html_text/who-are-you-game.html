                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the idea of making a game that's open ended, and having vague goals.
We looked towards games of similar genre such as AntiChamber.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gamifies personality tests. Instead of a series of questions, the player goes through a set of rooms, in no particular order, and with no specific goal stated for every room, and through their behaviour and choices that they make, a personality profile is produced at the end of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity game engine to develop the game, and used many free 3D assets from Google Poly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we're working with a 3D game with a full on character controller. Our experience with 3D models and shaders were also limited.
We had to learn how shaders and lightings work in a 3D work to give off a proper minimalistic feel to the world that we were trying to build.
A lot of gameplay mechanics had to be built to due to the nature of the game having a variety of tasks.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given that this was our first time making a 3D game, we were pretty happy with actually completing the game.
We also learned a lot about the Unity engine, especially in the context of 3D games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D games are not easy to make, especially with limited time and assets at hand. Shaders are extremely hard to grasp for beginners like us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Who are you?" game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might make it into a short yet complete 1-2 hour game, with way more rooms and possibly puzzles.
