                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by Charles Morris, who planned a similar project about a year ago. Most of the cognitive thought for the project and the vision are derivative from his vision from late 2017.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application takes in a user's portfolio file with appropriate funds and weights. It then provides analysis on the portfolio through meaningful graphs and charts, along with recommendations for funds to replace other funds in your portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building it was all through Microsoft Azure, in our own subscription for our hackathon project. We utilized Azure App Service to deploy our Angular frontend. For our API calls, we used Node-based Javascript Azure Serverless Function Apps to serve content through from our Database, and Azure SQL for our database store. We programmatically load funds into our database, and serve the content through our API through secured database connections. The backend calls performant Azure Serverless Functions in Python to compute a user's portfolio holdings in real time, as they request them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with scope was a big problem, as we wanted to convey all of our idea without implementing things like a login manager, every single chart, and dynamic behavior for all computations, as those are out of scope for a 48-hour hackathon. Therefore, we exposed our process and the work that we did, and used a lot of programmatic endpoints to serve content, and abstracted the ones we didn't have time for.
                </p>
