                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to MHacks with the goal of doing something with the Tesla vehicle that utilized the face recognition of the Azure API. Initially we started with the idea of having it as a security verification of the driver as the owner, but after a brief discussion with a mentor who explained the possibilities of going beyond that. We decided to make a program that kept faces as presets to suit the car to the user's preferences, such as having the windows up or down. Or the type of music that they prefer or was last playing when they got in, and the adjustment of the car seat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program, Auto is oriented around user experience and storing the user's face to our database to see what 'preset' to load to the car. An example of how our program would work is, a person would go in our car and get their face scanned. The program would track the person's actions that relate to the Tesla API, such as how low they set their car seat, the temperature they like, and the music they like. It is a program to improve quality of life and save time for the driver to get them to their destination faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Twilio to send SMS and pictures to our database in Firebase to store the faces from Azure, and we used Python for majority of the code in the backend. We also used ngrok to provide the localhost tunneling, and centered the program around Azure with the other APIs working to better it's function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into, was the implementation of the Tesla API in our code, as there is was little to no documentation of the API. We also ran into the problem of the mentors who were familiar with the API not being present, or having troubles themselves with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the Azure API to work with our program, and learning invaluable experience with the API and building on top our previous experience with Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Azure and Tesla APIs, along with familiarizing ourselves with HTTP requests and posts, which will help us next year and in our careers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Auto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand to other car platforms, such as Hondas and other smart cars if possible and we're looking forward to working with their APIs to implement our program in their vehicles.
