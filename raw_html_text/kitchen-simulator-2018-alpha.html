                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that a lot of people don't have even the most basic of cooking skills. (It's true. Everyone who asked about this project mentioned their lack of cooking skills. Everyone.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, you can pick up objects (fruits), turn on a stovetop, and it has a player who moves around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off not knowing Unity or C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the camera move with the player, making the player rotate with the camera, stopping the player from spinning wildly into the abyss, menu screen, switching scenes between menu and Kitchen, and learning Unity and C# enough to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Entirety of Transform Class in Unity, and a majority of the RigidBody class, collision classes, button methods, UI in general, and so many OnMouseX triggers. So mostly just unity stuff.
                </p>

                    What's next for Kitchen Simulator 2018 Alpha
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lessons, audio from the Smart kitchen (C), and some poetically inspired easter eggs (we wanted to burn the kitchen down. The short story is "There Will Come Soft Rains" by Ray Bradbury).
