                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The development of Internet technology has made it possible to deliver information the most earliest. So performance improvement by time axis can not be expected anymore. Therefore, frontier's eyes face towards the transfer of quantitative or spatial information. Then IoT, born by the needs of society, is a technology that has the potential to improve those performance at once. Now that the information transmission time has become nearly zero with human bodily sensation time, people no longer felt the need to improve the information transmission speed. And the human race extended the efficiency to the contents of the information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advent of the IoT boom, it has become possible to construct an IoT environment at low cost even on an individual basis. As the microcomputer progressed to modularization, peripheral modules became abundant with high performance. Each company also launched a service on the cloud platform to easily realize IoT, with which the results of documentation and implementation examples also increased. When considered as a system that can be implemented in a short time on several projects, these technologies have reasonable novelty and technical difficulty. This project was proposed under the idea of ​​how to utilize this technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IoT is a concept of sending and utilizing information, and its application range is almost infinite. Furthermore, flexible information processing techniques such as Deep Learning also developed and linking with IoT mutual link, further innovation was accelerated. Therefore, various proposals have been made, and there are not many common ideas among them. Brainstorming etc. were carried out among them. Due to technical and temporal constraints, I thought as a main axis that we can respond to a small, simple, low-cost need at a low cost, and invented key x tech under the idea of ​​solving human error with technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key &times; tech is an idea to prevent technology from forgetting to tighten the key. It is a system that monitors the state of the key of the entrance of the house, makes a reminder via smartphone's application in a situation where there is a high possibility of forgetting to close or is able to check the state of the house's key on the go. This aims to solve the problem of forgetting to tighten the key beforehand / afterwards. Also, from the idea of ​​being familiar and simple, we are making system design considering the size, price and ease of installation of the equipment from the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an application example, adding IoT to this leads to solving other problems other than forgetting to tighten the key. People who live in the house have grasped the time and situation about opening and closing their house. By doing this, you can warn you when there is a high possibility of a thief, or you can confirm the return of a child by identifying a person who opened and closed the key in cooperation with multiple smartphones. If you cooperate with a courier, you will be able to predict and predict when people are inside. As a whole you will be able to sense people coming and going in and out of the house. While people detection systems that rely on smartphones are prevalent, it seems that their ability to detect the absence of a person, even though there are place restrictions but smartphones do not work, may be a unique merit.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system consists of a device that detects the state of the key and a smartphone application that displays its state. In order to deal more with the key of the existing door to detect the key, the inclination sensor was adopted. As a method of installation, only attach a slave unit to Sam Turn. Leave the parent machine in a place you like with power. The master unit and the slave unit communicate with each other via bluetooth, and the master unit communicates with the wifi router. Arduino 101 is used in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Products containing built-in locking state detection systems that are circulated by major mail order makers and others are around $100 at a low price, and it is a small need, but the threshold for introduction is high. From the viewpoint of ease of introduction, this system reduced the cost to around $40 at the development stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Installation of the main body is completed by sticking the child device to the door. In addition, initial setting is completed by just inputting necessary minimum information from the application. Also, the display interface of the application is designed mainly to make minimum notification so as not to fill up information from other applications, so that it will suddenly switch to the display screen when launching the application so as not to take time for operation There. We store these information in the memory in the module so that connection setting etc. of wifi is not necessary again when the power supply of the main unit drops due to battery exhaustion or the like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just installing a key design or accessory that takes human error into consideration is enough if it only prevents you from forgetting to tighten the monitoring key from outside the house. It is effective to turn on the warning lamp on bluetooth or the entrance. One of the advantages of using wifi over these means is that you can monitor the status of your home from the outside. It is also possible to provide solutions for BtoB by big data processing using IoT.

                <p>
                    I had difficulty in designing according to the general key shape. The size of the handset is a trade-off with battery life and we are struggling to design to withstand a practical environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We considered considering application as an actual business at all stages in idea issue, development, preparation preparation. We focused not only on development but also on cost reduction of the main body and easiness of investigation and initial setting by competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the point of view of what social problems this system can solve, from the point of view of whether this system should be in society, we tried to devise a business model not profitable enough. In developing this system, the motivation to manage the feelings of parents who are anxious as to whether the children have gone home safely or not is uncertain at the time when they do not know whether to forget to lock them or not.

                <p>
                    If you do not close the key of your house at the stage you are about to leave the house somewhat by GPS, notify by application of smartphone. By doing this, warning is issued in a situation where there is a concern about forgetting to tighten the key, and it is prevented.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    When detecting the opening / closing of the key in the situation where the smartphone registered in the main body is near the entrance, it notifies the predetermined person together with the person's information. This allows the guardian to check whether the family and children have returned home safely.

                <p>
                    On the application get the age of the person living in that house. Therefore, assuming that students have a general schedule to go to school on weekdays and guardians have a general schedule to go to the company, the time of returning home can be estimated with the information of opening and closing the keys. By estimating at home information on this system it is possible to provide a solution that reduces the waste of the carriers asking during the absence of family members due to delivery of mails and baggage. Similar services are also possible from GPS information that can be obtained from smartphones. However, by using this system, we are trying to differentiate it by being able to estimate even if all people do not have a smartphone at home.

                <p>
                    The data detected by the main body is only the locked state of the key. In the future, user information is acquired at the time of initial setting of the application, and data is managed together with the user ID of a person within a certain distance from the entrance when the key is switched. By doing this, you can acquire data on who opened the key, and you can increase the information displayed on the application.
