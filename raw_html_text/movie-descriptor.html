                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being avid movie watchers, we regularly need to find out more about recently released films. Currently, we either watch the trailers on YouTube or read synopsis on IMDB. However, we prefer a quicker way of getting movie briefs. This is why we decided to build an Alexa app, Movie Descriptor, that gives movies' blurbs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movie Descriptor gives a short summary of a movie's plot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Alexa Developer Web UI to design the interaction model and the Amazon AWS Lambda to host our backend Javascript code that handles the code logic. The movie information is extracted from the Open Media Database (OMDB).

                    <li>
                        Difficulty in debugging because Alexa Development UI lacks easy logging of errors
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    We were able to build a complete Alexa app despite first exposure to Alexa development environment.
