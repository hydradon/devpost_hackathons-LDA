                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concerned by the refugee crisis in Greece and all over the world. We wanted to create something can give a voice to refugees. Most of the existing applications from organizations and volunteers provide aid, but it doesn't always address refugees' needs.
We built this prototype or concept using a user-centric approach. Who else than refugees is better placed to say what they need. 
After talking to the team behind the project and a little bit of research, we learned refugees arriving in Lesbos have smartphones so that's why we built this application, but we wanted to build a solution that encompasses all the refugees so we also built an sms application prototype.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Report refugee needs to organizations and volunteers in a very simple manner. Only 2 clikcs
Give organizations analytic platform and the location of various needs
Give volunteers an easy to use platform to answer refugees' needs
Capture refugee needs using SMS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a prototype using PowerPoint to materialize our concept. 
We also created an SMS workflow on how the interaction between refugees and volunteers would work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough coding skills to develop this application. 
Since many of the refugees around the world don't have smartphones, it's really hard to identify their location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a simple and basic design, but at the same time effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about SMS technologies specifically we'd like to use RapidSMS to implement our SMS solution. 
We also learned UX skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for basics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to take our design and actually make the application. We talked with Tech for Justice and they're willing to work with us on this concept.
