                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drexel has a free bus service that is available to all students and faculty, and
                </p>
                <p>
                    they are convenient to get around University and Center City except you do not
                </p>
                <p>
                    know when they are coming. The online schedule is sometimes incorrect or
                </p>
                <p>
                    inaccurate. Also, when you are at the bus stop, you do not know if the bus has already
                </p>
                <p>
                    passed or if it a minute away. This is where our Drexel Transportation project
                </p>
                <p>
                    comes in to play. Our application aims to solve this problem.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes an application that live-tracks where the Drexel University buses are located in Philadelphia. It displays a list of bus stops along each bus route.  Once a bus stop is selected, the app
would show a map with the current location of the bus and an ETA for when the bus 
will arrive at your stop. It takes user location and bus location to pinpoint the distance and amount of time it will take for the bus to get to the user, along with displaying an arrival time. There is also a feature that allows the users to create crowdsourced data so that the bus system can calculate data analytics.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a web page using HTML and Javascript.
We also have extra features that in javascript that work with mobile hardwares. 
-for the database we used MySQL

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have enough time to make the product as well rounded as we wanted it to be. 
We also had some slight struggles with integration initially because we all come from different backgrounds in technology.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never met each other before this and we were able to create a full project in under 24 hours.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We all learned about each others' strong suits and were able to round out our individual skill sets.
