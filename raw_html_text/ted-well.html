                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started my career as a k-12 educator. I've actually attempted to build this app several times and even built a prototype and tested it with 6 schools as a startup. That startup failed due to team issues but we got a lot of great validation from our early customers. This included 20 signups form teachers/schools around the country who wanted to buy the product. In the 6 schools that piloted, we helped multiple students get help with emotional issues. Teachers expressed that they never would have known about these issues without the app. I've wanted to rebuild it and make an actual product with it for over a year and a half. This hackathon gave me a chance to do just that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can log in to the Ted app and are greeted with a simple chat window. Ted asks the student a sequence of simple questions to assess the student's emotional and social health. This data is then analyzed and a sentiment analysis is performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Ted determine's that the student's checkin scores low then that means the teacher should be alerted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The teacher gets a push notification, text, or email and is able to get the student the help she needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After this hackathon, our plan is to release a first version of the app and get early signups. We'd like to further validate the buisness model and discover revenue streams.
