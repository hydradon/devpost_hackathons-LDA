                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was driven by the piles of waste we create everyday in our daily lives while living on a college campus. Although we have a vague idea of how much carbon we contribute, it is helpful to have a quick and easy way to measure this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application transforms the the user's thoughts on sustainability, by allowing them to easily access their carbon footprint information. With a heavily researched point system, and top of the line google image processing using the Google Vision API, the app allows the user to take pictures of their trash and track their footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and implemented the Google Vision API that was pre-trained to recognize objects in a picture. We were able to generalize most waste into five categories, and from these categories, we can extract information from the images. Using a point system, we track people's footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studios continually failed on all of our laptops, as well as some members in our group having non-intel devices, which proved to be a challenge when emulating. Also, even though we had 2 android devices in our group to emulate on, we were unable to emulate on those well. We also ran into challenge related to capturing an image with the app, hopefully this works in the demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the google vision api to get information about a picture, as well as making the basics of an app, as this was the first app that anyone in our group has made so it is a real accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of xml and how to create a basic android app, as well as implementing the google cloud software into our project.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the app so that it works reliably, as well as including an incentives system and location system.
