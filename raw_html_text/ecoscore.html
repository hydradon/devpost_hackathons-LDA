                    While looking up APIs/databases on food companies' plastic usage, we found out that there's a general lack of data and industry transparency in the area. That is when we came up with the idea to crowd-source that information. Taking inspiration from
                    <code>
                        Honey
                    </code>
                    , a popular chrome web browser that automatically applies vouchers on e-commerce websites, we've come up with a web browser extension that would capture when the user is ordering food online...
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would rewards users that provide data about restaurant's plastic usage and with that information build a grading system that can be used by food delivery websites to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        increase social impact and improve brand identity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        empower customers to make an informed choice when it comes to their environmental impact when ordering food online
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gain insight into customer behaviour
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        increase returning customers/ build brand loyalty
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For customers they can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        get free vouchers/offers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gain more awareness about how much plastic they used when ordering food online day-to-day

                    <li>
                        The chrome browser extension should popup and run a content-script when the url matches an order confirmation page. It selects elements of the DOM on the confirmation page to identify the restaurant that the user ordered from.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the user receives their food, they can fill in information about how much plastic cutlery, plastic bags, plastic containers, etc were provided.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This information gets added to the restaurant data and eventually we will be able to build up a reliable profile for how much plastic the restaurant uses and cumulate a rating for them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the other hand, the user's review count goes up and they get closer to their next reward.
