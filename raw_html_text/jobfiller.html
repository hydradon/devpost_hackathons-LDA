                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was really tired of filling job applications for jobs in the technology field. I had to put my resume and credentials over and over again for similar positions and the process was painful as all the companies asked me the same questions. So, I started small and created a solution called JobFiller that automatically learns to fill out all your job applications using a scripting language Python and Google's Selenium. Additionally, I saved the best for the last. I tried JobFiller on my college student job portal and it worked! Computationally, I applied to 25 jobs within 5 seconds. All thanks to JobFiller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JobFiller automatically fills out your job application after you apply for any job once. It's a smart learner that identifies your areas of interest, gets to know your profile and applies for 1000s of companies for you within seconds. A cool thing is that most companies have pretty much same positions and almost third party job application interfaces (commonly by Workday and Indeed.com) and that can be predicted, automated and answered using a machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used pure Python and Google's Selenium to train the job filler bot to understand the candidate's credentials and work on submitting an accurate application for them.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really hard to parse through websites that use the new CAPTCHA released by Google, known as the RECAPTCHA and Selenium produces errors on those websites. However, I tried my way out using an iterative approach and made full use of python libraries to disable CAPTCHA and inject in the interface legally.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of making this for the world by only thinking of how the application should be if I were to use it myself? That really personalized my approach to achieve remarkable results and growth in testing the application with a lot of edge cases because you only send a job application only to your potential employer and it serves as your only first impression too!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Selenium is a powerful tool that I can use to extend my web application for speech recognition.

                    What's next for JobFiller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Great! A new set of tools to deploy speech recognizer and significant performance boost depending on how scalable it will be and how many users use it.
