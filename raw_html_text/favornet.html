                    Leveraging our desire to reciprocate goodwill: users request favors; other users complete, initially out of the goodness of their hearts (think a random act of kindness - users will be encouraged to do this). The requester is encouraged to reciprocate by fulfulling favors for the responder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naturally there will be people who use this platform to their own self-interest, i.e. purposely fulfill favors because they have a favor they want fulfilled. But that's fine (welcomed, even!) because they're still being incentivized to help people - even if it's a selfish intent, the results are good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can functionally turn goodwill into a "currency."

                    1st iteration is a favor marketplace, however, these are the general ideas/principles and implementation may change in the future.
