                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right design to create a user center design and ensuring that all requirements were created. We had to create and recreate our wireframe's multiple times until we came out with a design that we were happy with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed every step for a UX design. We learned the importance of wireframing and how feedback is the most important aspect for UX design. We learned that UI is an interpretation of what we think our users want, however UX is what our users need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Invest Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Invest Me is more usability testing. We may have been able to create a final prototype that we are happy with but this doesn't mean that our users would be happy with the product. Having more Usability testing will give us more feedback on our product allowing us to make changes till we are even more happier with our design. Finally would come prototyping for the design to see it in working action.
