                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always forget when people tell us to text them when we get home.  And some people around here in Binghamton have no clue how much they drink when they go out.  We figured we could combine the solutions to these problems into one app so that both the user and their friends have enough information to be safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculates BAC based on time, sex, weight, and amount of alcohol.
Sends a text message to a preset contact when you arrive home after going out, and the message includes the user's BAC at time of arrival.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio :( with the google play store api for geofencing and android contacts and text message integration, BAC is based off the amount by weight of alcohol divided by estimated weight of blood and is recalculated every time the user interacts with the app, does not just use a formula to take the average over the whole time drinking as many other calculators do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never made an android app before so it was very challenging to use and learn the IDE.  Also, many android APIs that we found instructions for were deprecated, and many other features we thought we could implement were way more difficult than expected.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending message based on location, saving user data and calculating BAC accurately compared with other web based calculators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio is hard, android apis are not straightforward, we need to learn even more
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Run in background/foreground, update drink info from lock screen notifications, add mechanism for determining good transportation to get home, and an alarm to leave and get home at a desired time.  Also improving features like a real destination picker and multiple preset contacts.
