                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our society, many political views are looked down upon leading to a lack of intellectual discussion that many people, such as our team, yearn for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ControversMe is a free and simple to use web service that connects people in prompt driven chat rooms to discuss, argue, and practice their debate skills anonymously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used the ionic framework for the front-end website/application and Node.js for the server-side back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into/What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To accomplish the functionality of our application, our group had to implement
                    <strong>
                        Socket.io
                    </strong>
                    for the public chat rooms. Because none of us ever used this program, we spent hours scavenging the documentation to finally implement it correctly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we had little to no knowledge of languages such as
                    <strong>
                        SCSS
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        TypeScript
                    </strong>
                    , our group was still able to complete our application, though it might have taken the full 24 hours of the event.
                </p>

                    What's next for ControversMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on completing and tweaking the web service to finally release it to the general public.
