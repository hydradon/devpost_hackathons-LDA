                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We conducted a design thinking session to identify pain points in the journey of a project team member across a project lifecycle.  During this process the team determined that during the plan, design and build phases there were serious concerns about the whether the design of a project was going to meet customer needs and if we are doing the right thing.  We then conducted an ideation session to determine solutions that would address these concerns.  We came up with several ideas which were group into the concept of demand management and design thinking/journey mapping.  We then went through a ranking process to select design thinking &amp; journey mapping as our focus area.  We utilized open source design thinking and journey mapping materials from Standford D.School and Oracle as foundation to embed design thinking into the organization.
