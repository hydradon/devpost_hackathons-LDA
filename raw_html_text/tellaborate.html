                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A desire to create a github like experience for non-developers and non-coders to build a cinematic universe for stories. We took this idea and extended it collaborative story telling. Everyone has a story to tell and perspective to share, and many have not found a community to share it with, those that have a similar experience. We envision this platform as a new way to build these stories together and share unheard but often common narratives.

                    New movies. New stories. New fairy tales. New life in old fiction.

                    Stories of the refugees. Stories of the persecuted.

                    A tool for creative incremental story telling for professional and amateurs. It's like Github, but for the everyone (not just the techies). You can start stories for everyone to read. Set the story in your very own universe, with its own rules to follow. Or create a real life narrative and set guidelines on how to contribute. Other users can add their own stories within your world or diverge into their own alternate world to envision how the story will continue, where the stories never end.

                    It is also a tool for TV show writers to not only collaborate among other writers, but fans can help contribute in writing how they would envision the story to unfold on TV. It's a good way for TV show writers to interact with their audience and understand what the fans want for their beloved characters.

                    When we formed our team, we discussed possible ideas and settled on a collaborate writing platform similar to github but for creative people. The idea transform not only into a platform for interesting takes on new and old fiction stories into cinematic universe but also a platform for real life narratives for real people to share their perspective personal stories.

                    We hashed the technical process flow on the whiteboard. We divided up the front-end work and back-end work. We first settled on using nodejs and express framework to
