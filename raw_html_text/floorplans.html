                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although emergency services are often quick and efficient, the time lost by first responders trying to locate callers within a building can be costly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Floorplans provides callers with blueprints of the building they're in, and allows them to send their exact location within the building by pinpointing where they are on the blueprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major components to this project: the iOS app and the web app. The iOS app was built for callers to notify emergency services of their location using the SafeTrek API. The web app was designed for emergency services headquarters to see the information that the caller sent so that they can communicate it effectively to first responders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we faced was communicating data from the iOS app to the web app.
