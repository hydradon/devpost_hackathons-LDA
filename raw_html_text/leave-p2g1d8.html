                    This android app is designed for people who need a little motivation to get going through their day because the phone vibrates/reacts every so often until you reach your set location. These alarms can be updated anytime and there are features like color themes to fit your aesthetic~

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our stack consisted of Android Studio backend built on a standard android phone with several Google web services, java, sublime-text, and more for functionality of the application and trendy user interface.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was setting up a work environment, because we had to first learn how to develop android apps and then execute them through emulators.

                    Starting this project without prior experience building Android Applications. We went over several MOOCs, built 5 other applications this weekend, which culminated in a fully functional &amp; fun project!

                <p>
                    We learnt the basics of Java, Object Oriented Programming and creating Android applications. We also collaborated using Github and you can check out our work here -

                <p>
                    Learning how to deploy an application in the Play Store.
Expanding our app into an iOS application would be our next step, as well as gathering more user data to see what other features we could apply to help people become more productive with their day.
