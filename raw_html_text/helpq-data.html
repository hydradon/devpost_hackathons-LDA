                    HELPq is real-time help queue and mentor management application, targeted at hackathons and classrooms, where there is a need for issues to be claimed and satisfied within minutes. It includes a simple interface for requesting tickets, claiming tickets, and a powerful dashboard for administrating users/mentors and examining metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HELPq was originally built for HackMIT, but has been used at hackathons like Blueprint, Meteor Summer Hackathon 2015, WHACK, MakeMIT and WildHacks (among others!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is open-source and super easy to extend and customize! There's plenty of documentation and more gets added all the time. You only need to edit a few config files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This queue has been used for several hackathons now - and we've gotten some really fantastic numbers with mentor ratings and response time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At HackMIT 2015, 425 users submitted 502 tickets through our system, with an average response time of 9:37 and a median response time of 2:48. From our data, the majority of the time, a hacker could request help and receive world-class mentorship in-person, at their table, within five minutes, at a 1000+ person hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the queue has its own built in metrics panel, it's not (yet) extremely comprehensive. So, I've decided to spend my time (at a hackathon, of course!) to look back on past data, aggregated across hackathons, and see if there was anything interesting we could get out of it...
