                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to build a quadcopter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it SHOULD be able to self hover, pitch, and yaw. Unfortunately, we ran out of time and it's still very buggy / unsafe to present
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the raspberry pi to act as the gui to control the quadcopter. On the pi, there is a PWM shield that transmits pwm signals to a dedicated flight controller. An iphone app is also developed to control the quad, however because the quad is unable to self level we cannot demonstrate that aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was definitely a big issue. When dealing with hardware, we picked too ambitious of a task that required a lot of testing that we don't have the time for.

                    nothing, we suck :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to code a quadcopter is 3 days.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, given enough time and patience, this beauty will eventually be able to self level.
