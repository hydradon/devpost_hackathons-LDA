                    </strong>
                    I spent most of my time setting up a fully headless Raspi workspace. The pi is fully configured with Static IPs for both Ethernet and WLAN connections and will stream video to a server accessible to any device on the samenetwork. This took quite some time to setup as the network setting out of the box for Raspi are not very good (I also had no idea what I was doing)

                <p>
                    I am extremely proud of the headless setup. I was able to fully configure and program the pi without the use of desktop setup. I used ssh, VNC, and
                    <em>

                    to set up the pi so that I can connect to it merely using the hotspot on my phone. A huge step forward in making this a practical product!

                    Having never really used a raspberry pi for anything, I learned so much about it's capabilities, setup, and practical uses. I learned about rpi ssh, vnc servers, flashing images, and many other cool raspi things
