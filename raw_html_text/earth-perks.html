                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only have one Earth, so why not take care of what we have before it's gone? Every recycled item leads to a cleaner environment. Our inspiration came from the idea that people are more inclined to continue a certain behavior if there's a reward system involved. We thought if our users where able to track their recycling contributions, and have something that shows them their environmental impact, then they would feel more open to keep on recycling.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app keeps track of our user's recycling contributions, and returns encouraging feedback via our illustrated Earth character.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a cloud-based developing platform called Appery.io alongside MS Paint to build our first application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, building an app was far from our minds due to our lack of experience. However, while discussing possible ideas, we though to ourselves, "If not now, then when?" We decided to go for it, and let our creativity lead the way. Our biggest challenge was getting started. We didn't know what technologies would be best for our particular product, so we research possible platforms. We tried many different platforms and failed until we came across Appery.io. From there, we taught ourselves how to use that platform to build our app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was definitely a struggle, but we built our first working app! We are also proud of the way we were able to guide ourselves and learn from our mistakes in order to accomplish our goal.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work collectively as a group to accomplish a certain task within a constricted time frame. Not to mention that our patience and perseverance was put to the test. Also, we messed around with our first database, and scripting files. We experience first hand how to design a user friendly interface for our app.

                    What's next for Earth Perks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having actual physical results. We plan on developing a program which can send tree seeds to the user after they reach certain milestones within the app. Also, we would like to make our Earth character more interactive and realistic looking.
