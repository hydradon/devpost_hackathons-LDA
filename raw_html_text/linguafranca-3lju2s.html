                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be really cool to have a messaging app that allows people who speak different languages to be able to communicate easily without having to type in a common language.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between clients, the app sees which language each client has selected to translate from and translate to. When a client (sending) is sending a message to another client (receiving), before the message is sent over a socket, the google translate API takes the message, translates it to the language that the sending client has selected as the language to translate to, and it sends the translated message to the receiving client, and displays the original message for the sending client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using socket.io, we created a localhost that clients can connect to on a single computer. Right now, clients are distinguished between separate tabs in a browser.
