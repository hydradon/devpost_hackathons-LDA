                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe many individuals that are entering the workforce or have been in the work force already do not seem to have a grasp on some key ideas that keep the work place functioning smoothly.

                <p>
                    This project will assess the strengths and weaknesses of people's soft skills regarding communication, self management, stress, and productivity. The user will take a pretest, either quick or more in depth, for any of these categories, and based on their scores we will provide tips and resources to help them improve.
