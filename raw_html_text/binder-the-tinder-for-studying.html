                    We need more people to study with and we don't know our classmates too well yet since we're all freshmen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app provides access to profiles of people nearby who either will tutor or be a good study partner!

                    We created it in javascript through fusetools so that it would be compatible for both iOS and Android devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was that none of us had been familiar with javascript before this hackathon began, so it provided us with a great opportunity to learn a new language, but we had to do so in a very short amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope we will be able to develop this app to the point of 100% functionality so that it can become a tool utilized by our school community!
