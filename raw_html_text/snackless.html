                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wonder why you gained weight, even though you do not eat much? Well, one of the main reasons would be the snacks consumed in between meals. Although this is an issue that targets multiple age ranges; young adults, college students, in particular, with their poor time- and workload-management skills, end up consuming wide varieties of snacks throughout the day. This goes without realizing the number of calories, sugar, fat, and cholesterol the snacks contain. As a result, many gain weight and possibly, in extreme cases, can pose a risk of contracting type-2 diabetes and/or high cholesterol levels later down the road. In order to leave a lasting impression on the daily overeruption of snacks, we present you SnackLess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SnackLess provides users with a simple, and intuitive way of tracking the snacks they consume throughout the day. Users will input the snack he or she consume throughout the day. SnackLess will find the nutritional information of the snack and record it. At the end of the day, SnackLess will provide statistical summaries and data visualization, through the use of pie charts and tables, of the different nutrients, such as calories, sugar, fat, and cholesterol the user has taken in throughout the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SnackLess is built using Android Studio. It uses the built-in SearchView class in Android Studio. The main interface including a 2-tab TabLayout view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the event without any ideas, we realized that we did not have the necessary Android Dev skill sets to create the app. The download, installation, and set up process took longer than expected. In addition, to the whole process of getting used to the Android Studio's interface and version dependencies, we were not able to get much completed. Another challenge was our attempt in using a third-party API to obtain the nutritional information of the snacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our shortcomings, we were happy to at least get the main user interface working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the event, we had no idea on what we were going to work on. Two ideas stood out and had relatively plausible plans, however, we had to choose one idea before the end of the first day to ensure enough time to start on the idea on the second day. Despite giving ourselves time to work on the app, we realized that the programs we used were significantly more difficult to work with than expected. Throughout the process, we learned to debug our error messages, line by line, to check for misspelling, version dependencies, and other error messages that we did not understand. Thus granting us insight on how tedious debugging in a professional setting can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SnackLess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we wish to implement the Nutrition API into the App. Although not shown here, we have an in-progress search bar, which we hoped to finish; hoping that one day, we would be able to bring SnackLess out to others to use.
