                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by r/place

                <p>
                    It is a collaborative/competitive drawing app where users have to go to a location to draw there

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend using react-native and react-native-maps, and the backend with socket.io, postgres, and heroku

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges this weekend.
First, the Penn firewall prevented us from accessing our database.
Second, the maps api we are using claims it has support for overlaying images, but it actually does not. This caused an incredible amount of issues, since we structured the whole application on using 4-bit PNG's
