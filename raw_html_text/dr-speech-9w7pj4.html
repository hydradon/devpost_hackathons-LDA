                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is inspired by the interaction between Alexa and me. As a non-native English speaker, I found it challenging at times to tell or ask Alexa for different commands or questions because of my accent. I found that Alexa will be my perfect speech therapist at home who can constantly correct my pronunciation whenever I interact with her. This skill can benefit a large population of people whose native language is anything but English.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost to have a one-on-one speech therapist section is expensive (Average cost $150-200 per hour). With Alexa who speaks perfect American English, correcting your foreign accent and improving your speaking can now be both affordable and fun!
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS for the front end, mocha and chai for the testing, and Node.js and Amazon Web Service for the backend. I also built this skill from scratch based on Amazon Alexa "Hello World" sample code.
