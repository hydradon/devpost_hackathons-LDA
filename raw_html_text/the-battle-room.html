                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make a game with the language Processing, which we all had downloaded for the first time today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game has astroids that move around, as well as a bot that tries to kill a good being. The good being must defend itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Processing to make our game! And Github, I guess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of bugs in Processing, especially because we were beginners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We fixed the bugs! Also, we effectively learned a programming language in a day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Processing is a pretty cool spinoff of Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Battle Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more features, as well as maybe embed it into HTML with p5.js.
                </p>
