                    Inspiration : Road safety has been a paramount concern for all the govts. and citizens. There is a need to have an app which can help people driving safely and help people to be more cautios as they drive in accident prone areas or at high speeds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does:  It allows user to record trip. It shows nearby parking and bus stops as ride continue. It also alerts user for accident prone area and also puts their mobile phone on silent mode once they exceed pre-decided speed. User can share the location with family members/friends and App can also send emergency messages to these emergency contacts in case of any such requirement.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: How I built it : We converted inspiration into technical requirement. We worked out software and hardware requirement for this app. We developed on Android platform using related technologies.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Selecting features to make this app useful and attractive for general user was a big task. We had to select best few features out of many suggested features. Also, putting mobile on silent mode while sensing speed was technically a challenging task and it was implemented successfully with on road testing of this feature.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Accomplishments that I'm proud of : Incoroprating all the above mentioned features and the specially the feature which puts mobile on a silent mode as speed exceeds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We learned to develop technology which could really help and save people from the dangers of driving on road. We learned how technology can be used to develop app which will help common public and improve their life.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeDrive: Emergency messages can go to Police Control room, Ambulance and Fire Brigade, as happens in the developed countries. Driving habits can be captured and analysed for safe or unsafe drive and user and his parents can be sent message or rating for the driving habits.
