                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up, we all had very fond and nostalgic memories of watching the Pokemon series and playing its many games. As a result, we wanted to combine modern technology with our favorite childhood heroes in a fun and exciting game for everyone to play!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the game starts, the player gets to choose between three different types of Pokemon they want to play with. Each of the Pokemon have different advantages regarding speed and fire rate, but the player is able to switch between them throughout the game if they wish to do so. During the battle, the player must shoot orbs at other Pokemon coming towards them. The game gets progressively harder as the player levels up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Vuforia as our foundation for the game and the AR implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficult part of this project was setting up and figuring out how to divide tasks and responsibility between the group. We have never worked with AR before, so it was all a new experience. However, the most challenging part of this project was trying to fix a particularly horrible merge conflict. Half of the team was reverted back to a commit that was updated 12 hours ago. Through perseverance and teamwork, we were able to fix our problems a few hours before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how far we were able to accomplish with this game, as all of us have had no experience with AR.This is the first time all of our team are working together as well, and we are proud of the diligence and hard work everyone put in to finish this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working with augmented reality was both easier and harder than expected. It was easier in the sense that putting the 3D model was just a click and drag of a button, but it was harder because we ran into a lot of technical conflict along the way, not necessarily AR-related.
