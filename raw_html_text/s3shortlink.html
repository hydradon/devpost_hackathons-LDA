                    Amazon S3 Shortlinking
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This package is a wrapper around the AWS CLI that is intended to be used in 
creating self-hosted shortlinks in a simple fashion on an Amazon S3 bucket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted something that allowed me to easily share links with friends without
having to rely on some third-party site that I don't know the inner workings of.
Although there are issues that come with using the cloud, I would prefer to
use code that I mostly understand. I thought that this would be a fun and
interesting project to work on during a small hack day like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this is that it should be a simple command-line interface to
create shortlinks, list the shortlinks that have been created, modify existing
ones, and delete shortlinks that are no longer necessary. It requires an IAM
user to be created on Amazon Web Services with S3 permissions. If the
cmdlet is given these credentials and something to link to, it will take care of
the rest.
