                    CompareMe is our solution for a quick and easy way to see what people think about certain topics. These topics can range from well-known people, organizations, companies, places, films, and universities.

                <p>
                    CompareMe takes in a search query and uses Haven on Demand&rsquo;s Entity Extraction API to identify the entities, or important topics, to use in its search. It then digs through the past week on Twitter to find all of the tweets pertaining to these entities, runs Haven on Demand&rsquo;s Sentiment Analysis on these tweets, and calculates the average sentiment for each entity per day. CompareMe also keeps track of the overall number of positive and negative tweets for each entity and displays this data as well.

                    The Text Analysis APIs are actually quite powerful, which made achieving our end goal of creating a quick general opinion visualization tool much easier. The Entity Extraction API ultimately dictated what tags to search in Twitter, and the Sentiment Analysis API did all of the work in determining how people felt in the past week about these tags. All we had to do was create a way to put this data into intelligible graphics.

                    Edward Yang - Last year at University of Waterloo
During high school, an upper year recommended I try out an &ldquo;introduction to programming&rdquo; class where the final project was building any game for fun. Fell in love with hacking stuff since then. Had a great time at Boston Hacks, spent 4 hours getting fried chicken with some friends in the area. Lots of swag, lots of food and great prizes!

I think I can say that I first got interested in technology when I was a young child, while watching my dad tinker with the computer that he put together himself. From that point on, I was curious about learning how computers worked. My experiences at a robotics summer camp, and through my game creation group projects in my high school programming classes only furthered my passion for technology. I guess I can say I&rsquo;m addicted to solving problems and creating things.
Boston Hacks was my first hackathon, so I came in not really knowing what to expect or what I wanted to build. I was able to put something together within those 24 hours and saw a bunch of other great projects, so all in all, I had a great time.
