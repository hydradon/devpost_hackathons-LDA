                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we realized that a lot of people get bored easily and more times than not, they don't know what to do. This app serves as a way for people to see events at a moment's notice and go enjoy themselves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to show you the events around you at any given moment so that you can pick and choose what you want to do
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we wanted to make a simple user interface that was friendly enough but the time limit and lack of knowledge of proto.io didn't allow us to finish on time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no idea how to use proto.io and it took a while before we figured out that saving your work overrides anything that your other partners wrote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we managed to make at least the first page
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that only one person can properly work on proto.io at a time without messing it up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escapade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to develop the app and actually create a successful prototype
                </p>
