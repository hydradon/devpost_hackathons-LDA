                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If our friends and family are allowed to spam us with baby photos and stuff we dont get, then we will spam them with encrypted posts that only we can understand!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to encrypt a facebook status. Only people with the chrome extension and the relevant key is allowed to decrypt and view the post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Javascript and Chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulating the Facebook html was a rather difficult and tedious thing to do. This is probably the biggest source of weird bugs and "Features&trade;".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had all spend little to no time with javascript and none of us had made a chrome extension before this hackathon. So getting as far as we did was a big win for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, javascript and more javascript. Also we learned the hard way that the planning (and sleeping) phase of a project is an essential thing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facebook Encrypt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only the future will tell... Hopefully less "Features&trade;".
