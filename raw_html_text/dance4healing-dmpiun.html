                    APA reported 77% of Americans has physical symptoms due to stress, and 73% psychological. 60-90% of doctor visits are due to stress. Work stress cost $300 billion to employers annually. Patients, elders and caregivers suffer from physical fatigue and severe stress. They are often homebound due to compromised immune systems, isolated and lonely, triggers anxiety and depression. Stress also fuels cancer spread by triggering the master gene ATF3. Behavior change is the toughest challenge in healthcare. Research shows Creative Arts Therapy (music, dance, art) can be one of the most effective tool to combat stress. It improves cancer patients&rsquo; quality of life by 50%, reduces pain by 59%. Moderate exercise makes cancer treatment more effective. ⅓ of Americans are &gt;50 now, ⅕ will be &gt;65 in 2030. Alzheimer&rsquo;s accounts for ⅕ of Medicare costs in 2015, and will be ⅓ by 2050. Dancing reduces the risk of dementia by 76%, helps prevent falls, combats aging, heart disease, chronic pain, diabetes, and neurological disorders. All of which costs the U.S. $1.8 trillion. Dancing will greatly reduce $400 billion economic cost in eldercare in the US, and help governments over the world prevent the economic downfall caused by aging. Yet music and dance are underutilized in healthcare. The U.S. Government and health systems have an urgent need to reduce medical costs. The Obama administration&rsquo;s overhaul of doctors fees is tied closely to quality, rather than quantity, of care.

                    We need a way to raise awareness of these medical research behind health benefit of creative arts therapy. There is also an unmet need for an effective, low-cost technology platform to enable patients and elders to dance with caregivers, other patients, friends and families remotely for home-care.
