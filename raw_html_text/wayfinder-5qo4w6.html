                    Is a web program made to assist students in optimizing the process of searching and retrieving the different modules that they are eligible for based on the courses they have taken.Students can input their courses and Wayfinder will tell them all of the modules that they have met the admission requirements for and suggest future ones that they are on track for, rather than them having to search for the module individually and cross reference the courses they have taken with that one the site page.

                    There are many different things that can contribute to anxiety and stress as a student. From deadlines, to living on your own, the life of a student sometimes feels overwhelming. As a group, we recognized that the module selection process can be tedious, time consuming and inefficient. The current process can take hours if a student is searching through multiple courses, modules, programs and faculties. Additionally, other than an academic adviser (who is notoriously difficult to meet with), there are few resources in place to show students the modules that they are eligible for based on the courses that they have taken that they may not even be aware of.

                    WayFinder is meant to be a tool to help ease the anxiety students face surrounding figuring out courses and degree choices. It makes the process of module selection much more efficient and informative for students, making the process less stressful. It works to educate students on all possible opportunities which they may be interested in, regardless of their current enrollment status.

                    Additionally, WayFinder still has a long way to go before it becomes the fully functioning, useful application which we intend and hope for it to be. Within our group, we were placed with all first-time hackers from disciplines other computer science and very little exposure to coding languages. Due to the constraint of time, we had to try our best to transform our idea into something simple enough for the concept to be grasped while learning and using code for the first time. This was challenging for us, but ultimately, we got a sample, functioning product by the end of the hackathon.
