                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The KStore is a vital part of the theatre department at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. It has an extensive inventory that all of the sub-departments can purchase from for theatre productions. This project was inspired by real-life difficulties navigating the inventory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to search the KStore inventory, keep track of their budget, and add daily receipts as they make purchases for shows. Previously, the only way to go through the KStore inventory was by scrolling through an unsearchable extensive PDF by hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a prototype with Sketch and began the process of converting it to a usable web app made with Python and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We quickly realized that the scope of the project would take vastly more time than we had available! We discovered the importance of creating an organized plan while figuring out what we could feasibly accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both tackled things that we had never tried before! Christina had used Flask and Bootstrap a little bit before this project, but not to this extent. Eleni had never coded in Python before. Neither of us had used Sketch before and we both ended up liking it a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KStore Digital
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would love to be able to implement this at KCPA
