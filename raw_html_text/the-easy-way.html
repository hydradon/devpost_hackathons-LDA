                    This application is still in development and is not ready to go live quite yet. However this program is an online shopping application that will be beneficial to both the consumer and supplier. Once the application first runs the user will be prompted to decide the usage of this software. Depending on their choice, business or personal, the application will then categorize the information inputed and cross-referenece that intel through IoT. The process includes utilizing NRC's API to catalog information. If the personal option is selected, the application acts as an online shopping store that queries all products globally. The products will be sorted by price and quality. The user will occur online shopping points to the companies that they shop at most frequently, providiing the user with promotional deals and discounts. If the business option is selected, the application will record the quanitity and price of materials required to develop the product being sold. We utilized Black Rock's API to take that data and predict the suppliers profit margin. The suppliers will have the option to view predictions for up to five years or as low as one month. This application is being developed by Jibri Tolen and Valerie Wise.
