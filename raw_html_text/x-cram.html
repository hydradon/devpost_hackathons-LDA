                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the project sprung from our struggles to study ahead of time and be prepared enough for our first college midterms. We realized that it's not time to study that students lack, but the time to organize their study materials and ensure they are learning the right concepts before their next exams/

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right, now it is a platform for open-source educational APIs, which scrapes through gigabytes of data and has the potential to itemize content from a variety of online sources. We now have implemented Khan Academy's open source API and a database which communicates between three devices to store User Data, but that's just the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, we have a register or web server (created by flask) that communicates between the android studio application on one computer and the MongoDB data cluster database running on a separate device. After developing register methods, we quickly created a parser and API through MongoDB to scrape for content given to us from Khan Academy's API. Efficiently, we implemented this in an Android App, which implements OKHTTP library to communicate with the register.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our real-scale hackathon project, utilizing Mongo DB and communicating effectively from the Android Application was a big challenge. We also ran into issues in storing user data and preferences in the database.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning about MongoDB, Flask, OKHTTP and utilizing those libraries and/or databases in our project.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize an android studio and communicate effectively with a server.

                    What's next for X-Cram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot that's possible with our application right now. Utilizing all it's potential, we plan to implement many different API's from various open-source educational services, such as Quizlet, Coursera, etc. We also hope to improve on the front-end design aspect, and hope for a better user experience.
