                <h2>
                    Getting Started
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team formed when three friends (who were at the very beginning of their coding careers) grabbed another guy they see around campus from time to time (who doesn't code at all). While they may not have had lots of experience like the other participants, they held within them great passion. This passion was leveraged in the first hour as the team members gathered around a white board discussing problems that faced their community at Wentworth Institute of Technology. Ultimately the team agreed that the issue they wanted to challenge was mental health on college campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Toolkit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team understood that nothing that they could make would solve mental health, so instead they spent hours researching the main concerns students face and issues with the delivery of support on college campuses. The team decided instead of trying to do the seemingly impossible, they would create a toolkit that stays on a student's mobile phone to be there when they most need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team decided to use Android Studios in the beginning but soon learn its a lot more difficult than it looks. We quickly changed to what we were most comfortable with as beginner coders, which is JavaFX. The three coders on the team had some experience working with JavaFX in the past so it was the right choice for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges the Team Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge that the team faced was understanding two words, 'mental health.' The team wanted to build something that could truly make a difference in the Wentworth campus, and campuses beyond. To understand mental health the team spent hours researching what college students were experiencing, what colleges were currently doing to support students, and ultimately where the short comings were. The second issue that the team faced was a lack of overall experience. The language that the team knew was Java, and the only tool they knew was Eclipse. Even with these challenges, the team never lost sight of their goal, instead, they simply pivoted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Team Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was proud that they could come together and leverage their vastly different skills. Not only did they choose an ambitious problem to understand, a difficult problem to solve, a platform (mobile app) that they had never tried, but the team was able to deliver a working and well-designed toolkit that accomplished the team&rsquo;s goals; to educate, connect, and support. Ultimately, the team learned more than they thought they ever would from this event, and that is something to be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While researching mental health, our team learned how mental health affects men and women. We found men with mental illness are less likely to receive treatment than women. This also affects Wentworth and its community as the male to female ratio is 80:20 but the Center for Wellness does not reflect that. We also noticed that students who want to get help do not know about the counselor or the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Temporal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team plans to connect with Wentworth's Center for Wellness to implement it in their community.
