                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space pirate training is a virtual reality game with very interesting mechanics, that we originally hoped to implement. The idea of a first person shooter where the player is in a locked position and has to use the motion controls to avoid damage was very entriguing to our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up altering the mechanics to be a game where the character is locked in place and is ambushed by robots. You must aim and shoot using the oculus rift headset and controller to survive as long as possible. The onslaught of robots never seizes and the goal is to survive for as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity to create the graphics, environment, objects, animations and more. We also used visual-studio to write the code for the objects and mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having much experience with Unity, we were faced with a steep learning curve and had to overcome this obstacle. Together as a team we split the work up and managed our time well enough to create a decent version of our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a fast rate spawning system for the enemies to rapidly increase the game's difficulty. The fast paced shooter provides a lot of entertainment and has a lot of replay value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of our members learned different aspects of unity and coding with C#. From animation to effects to coding the functions of each individual object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trigger Finger Shooter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ideas that were benched for the time being that we hope to acknowledge in a later rendition of the game, such as, a slow-motion effect when enemies got close, moving platforms with enemies mounted to make aiming at them more difficult, and even create a proper running animation for each individual enemy.
