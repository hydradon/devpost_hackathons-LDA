                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a brain storming session with the prevalent use of QR codes in society today!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app generates one QR code from three different strings. This occurs by encoding each string in a separate color from the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) color model. The three generated QR codes (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are then layered on top of each other to form one colorful QR code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to scan all the data on the color QR code, when a picture is taken we then separate the image and have them decoded one at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mobile application with Java using Android Studio and took advantage of the Google Cloud Platform to implement the Firebase development platform. Firebase provided powerful machine learning algorithms to decode the pictures of QR codes taken by the camera of the mobile phone. The open source library ZXing (zebra crossing) was used to encode strings into QR codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how the bitmap object works in order to properly manipulate the data. Properly using Intents and layouts in Android Studio to display the desired QR codes to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to come together as a team and fulfill the project duties within the given time frame, and able to add extra features and properly implement them. And to be patient with each other! (Although not always patient ^_^)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to coordinate with a team using a version control system. How to take advantage of UI features in Android Studio. To not be afraid to change the tools early on in a project. How to take feedback from teammates and have confidence in our abilities!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QubeR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adaptation to different use cases, such as x,y,z coordinates in one QR-code, multiple social media accounts for a single QR code, SVG and xml data encoded directly into QR-code, and many more ideas yet to be thought of!
