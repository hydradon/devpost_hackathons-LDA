                <h2>
                    Our Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our concept is based on the observation that it is very hard for some people to physically visit the doctor. Whether due to time constraints, isolated location, restricted mobility, or insufficient income, difficulty in getting to a doctor is a widely faced challenge with serious health consequences. The original concept stemmed specifically from the issues faced by people with little access to transportation to the hospital, but we soon realized that it could be used for so much more. The technology to check one's own individual vitals is already out in the commercial space and with the added technology of the cloud, transporting this data is easier than ever before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design concept was born when we realized that several electronic wrist watches available today already possess the capability to monitor various individual vital signs of the wearer. Heart rate monitors are standard in most smart watches, and there are thermometers, blood pressure monitors, and even oxidation monitors in wrist watches currently on the market. We decided combine these devices and include a few additional technologies to provide patients with a way to send data to their doctors and have a virtual doctor&rsquo;s appointment from their own homes. The idea of the home check-up is the core idea of the project, it can be easily expanded to great effect. Elderly people who cannot leave their homes or do not want to go to the doctor could be assisted by caretakers or family members in utilizing Doctor Go to receive quality medical care from their doctors despite limited mobility with minimal strain on interpersonal relationships. Speaking of family members, Doctor Go could provide lower-income families with the means to ensure that all members can track their vital signs and conference with doctors without the heavy costs associated with transportation and appointment scheduling.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inexperience and little access to the required hardware
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is innovative and generally unexplored in the industry and we have networked with several ArchHacks sponsors in order to achieve a more complete vision of our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how far you can take an idea despite limited hardware capability, and the power of collaborative feedback from experienced professionals in the field. We also gained a lot of knowledge through our research about current smart tech and wearables that can read vitals.
