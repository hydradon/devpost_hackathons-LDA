                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see our family and friends juggling their jobs and chores. People who are close to them might be able to help them, but they don&rsquo;t know how. We created Busybee to provide a solution to this problem and connect friends and family simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can use this app to easily post any errand that you want a friend to run for you, and track their route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we used a designing app called Fluid UI to design every screen of our interactive web app (it is also compatible on mobile devices). Then, we made very basic HTML files (using Sublime and VI) to cover the basic functions of the app. Later, we added CSS and JavaScript to make the app look professional and functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to format everything, especially when we didn't indent our
                </p>
                and  elements. Since we started from scratch, it was difficult to link all the pages together. We were trying to design our app and problem-solve at the same time.
                <p>

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making an app that we feel is extremely useful to a large audience. We're also proud of everything we learned today. We learned how to use various Text Editors, including Sublime and VI. We started our PixelHacks journey not being able to use GitHub or even save HTML files, so we feel very accomplished with what we have to present today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, we learned so many new things (formatting, designing, etc.)  about HTML, and we also learned how to use GitHub for the first time!
                </p>

                    What's next for BusyBee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that in the future, we can make our interactive web app into an IOS app.
