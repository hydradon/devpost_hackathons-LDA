                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a web app that would provide information on getting and keeping healthy. Although there were many other amazing alternatives such as Bodybuilding.com, we felt they were too consumer-business focused as they continuously try to drive revenue through their online shops or ads. There is also not a lot of information about common injury prevention and stretches, or they were really hard to find. We also felt that allowing others to post their own workouts or stretches would allow for a more crowdsourced environment.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to filter a muscle group very quickly and provides you a list of exercises, stretches, and common injuries. There is a base set of pre-populated database entries, but it also allows you the ability to enter your own entries. This will create a crowdsourced encyclopedia.
