                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make an application that tracks the popularity of certain memes on Twitter using text analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It queries for the most recent tweets posted online and compares them to the tweets that we've trained on in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the twitterscraper Python library to scrape tweets for certain memes. I then streamed those into a Google BigQuery database where I did some SQL queries to make the data more usable. I then worked on using Google Cloud DataFlow to manipulate the text of the tweets into something more desirable (by removing emoji and by shortening urls to just their hostname). I then used TensorFlow to classify the text according to certain memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was having a lot of trouble working with DataFlow, as it was something I had never worked with before. Additionally, the training sets are rather poor as I didn't have time to go in and check all the tweets to make sure they were properly classified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did some cool Machine Learning stuff with platforms I had never used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about Google Cloud Platform, Tensor Flow and text classification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meme Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really want to continue polishing it and also properly categorize the data so the models will be better.
