                    A household&rsquo;s electricity consumption follows a pattern, which is related to the devices and heating systems in use and the outdoor conditions, but also the typical behavior of the people that are part of that household.
 Detecting and monitoring those patterns can bring a lot of benefits to the consumers, such as 
&bull;    suggesting changes in behavior to cut down the electricity bill
&bull;    alerting on unusual patterns, which may signal device malfunction or poor insulation, for example
&bull;    monetizing the behavioral data: allowing access to your data in exchange for discounts, and relevant and timely offers
