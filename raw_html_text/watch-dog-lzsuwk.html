                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always struggle to find a streaming partner of a show I want to watch. Even when I do, I am not sure if it is the cheapest one. I wonder if I can just ask someone every time I want to watch something and he/she tell me the best streaming partner for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watch Dog Amazon Alexa skill allows you to just say which show do you want to watch and Alexa will automatically find streaming partners for you.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Just Watch API to find the streaming partner.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was not able to find just watch API URL, after a lot of googling I was able to find an MIT Licence based python library for this.

                <p>
                    I had a really bad fever, I almost decided to give up, but I wanted to complete my project and prove others that I can still do it.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have to manage my work properly next time, there might be chances of falling in the last days.

                    What's next for Watch Dog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will integrate machine learning so that Alexa can recommend streaming partner and shows as per user's watch/search history so that they can subscribe to right streaming partner next time.
