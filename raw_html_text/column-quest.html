                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to either select an image from their camera roll or take a picture of column. Then our app compresses the image, to increase the speed of later calculations, converts it to grayscale, turns it into a matrix of its pixels, and then uses linear algebra's conceptualizations of vector spaces to find the smallest norm between the inputted column and the learning set for each kind of column (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian).

                <p>
                    We were working in Xcode in Swift and iOS 11.
