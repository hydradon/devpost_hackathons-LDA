                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The local Philadelphia community gives so much to us, so we wanted to use this opportunity to give back. We wanted to increase visibility for events held by local grassroots organizations and small businesses in the Philly area. We want to inspire everyone to re-invest in our local communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    philly-phestivities is a community calendar that aggregates listings from other Philly news and event sites to organize them in one place, for you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python scripts to pull in and sanitize events, Firebase to store them as a non relational database, and JS to display them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Date parsing was surprisingly difficult, we had to write several methods to deal with all the different ways people list the dates of events and convert them into a standardized date and time format.
Cleaning up the raw data that we were aggregating so it could be normalized and formatted.
                </p>

                    Creating a professional looking first website after being introduced to HTML and CSS at one workshop the night before.
