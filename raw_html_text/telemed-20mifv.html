                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a CS Premed Student trying to figure out ways to connect computer science to medicine. As I was researching a project, I realized that the best way to combine the two together would be to create a quick way to send information to doctors without having to go to the doctors. Since I'm somewhat lazy and hate having to attend a doctor's appointment, I figured, "Why not create a device that could scan your vitals and send them to a doctor?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device obtains sensory data (bpm) to a server, which can then be processed by the owner of the server. The user can also see his or her own data as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Arduino IDE and a MySQL database server to obtain sensory data from a pulse sensor and send it to the database. I used ReactJS for the website portion of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a multitude of problems I had to face. For one, I was learning how to use an Arduino on the spot! Another was being able to connect the Arduino to the MySQL database. A third was being able to have my sensor function properly (sometimes it wouldn't connect to the Arduino due to me putting the pins in the wrong ports). A fourth problem is getting a functional website up and ready. I'm still in the process of creating the website (I would like to put in some features such as authentication and display of the data). A fifth one was that I had to do this all by myself in two days! I didn't have any teammates, so doing all this by myself was a daunting task, but one that I'm proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I can't believe I figured out how to make an Arduino work and be connected to a database in less than a day! I thought I would be running into a whole lot of problems (which I did), but I expected to take longer than a day to code. At times, I was frustrated at issues such as the latest MySQL version having a different authentication protocol than the connection library I had for the Arduino, but after taking breaks for a few hours and then sitting back down with fresh eyes, I was able to solve my problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use an Arduino and connect it to a database. I also learned how to manage my time efficiently when it comes to short term projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Telemed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to include more features in my React website (such as authentication and displaying a chart for the graph). I might want to make the database more clean (since all I'm doing is storing a string with the data in it). I also would like to implement more sensors into this product to get more vitals and biostatistics.
