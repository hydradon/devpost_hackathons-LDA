                    This is a GMail add on that will allow the user to quickly determine the sentiment behind their received email. If you've ever wondered if the emails people have sent you are leaning strongly toward a certain sentiment or another but you don't have the emotional bandwidth to actually determine this, SENT-iment analysis can perform the task for you! Simply add the SENT-iment analysis GMail plugin, and for any email you open, the plugin will tell you what the sentiment is and a breakdown of the probabilities that it leans toward a certain sentiment or other.
