                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a software developer I enjoy making an impact on other people's lives, and in this application I found a way to channel that energy into Dreamscape. I enjoy fixing problems that I see day to day, and I noticed that when I write my dreams down in the iOS Notes app, the dreams become very unorganized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dreamscape allows you to keep track of your dreams really easily in your user profile journal, and it also allows you to read interesting submissions sent in by other Dreamscape users who thought their dream was cool enough for the world to read about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift with an MVVM architecture to design the front end, and I used Firebase to handle the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling cocoapods and XCode being buggy because it was just updated. Sleep.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the level of focus and detail that I brought to this application. It felt like I could have worked on it forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I really do love what I do/have chosen as a career.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dreamscape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to work out all of the details that I didn't have time to get to (Icons, small animations, etc) and submit to the App Store soon. For the second version after submission, I will create a 3rd tab that is an alarm clock. When the user swipes open their push notification to wake up, deep linking will take the user right to the create a new dream view with a speaker listening. That was they don't have to do any typing. They could just speak and Dreamscape would write everything down for them.
