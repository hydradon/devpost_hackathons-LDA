                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired by the reminders that I've seen on my friends' phones and the "oh no's!" I hear every once in a while from my family members &mdash; all when they've forgotten to take their pills. It's important to finish medication regimens, especially antibiotics, in order to prevent relapse of infections or even the development of superbugs.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Allows users to set up reminders via Alexa, telling them which pills to take on which day.
