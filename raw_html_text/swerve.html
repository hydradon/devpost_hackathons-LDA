                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we got inspired by the frustration experienced from long and erratic winter commutes. Commutes that unexpectedly take longer than usual have a very real financial consequence, which we usually ignore because gas is filled up at the start/end of the week
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Estimates the distance, time and cost of route options prior to departing on your commute. The user can then select the most financially responsible choice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Maps Routes and Directions API we made html requests to receive detailed data on multiple possible routes from point A to B. Then using published car efficiency statistics we stored in a database using Google Cloud Services we pulled that data into our Python program to calculate the estimated cost of each route and give recommendations to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were issues syncing the database with the python script and hosting the script online.
