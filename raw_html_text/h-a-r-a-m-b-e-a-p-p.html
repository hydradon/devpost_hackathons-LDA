                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both team members are pretty terrible procrastinators. We recognize the helpfulness of the occasional 'poke' to help keep on track.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two functionalities:
1) The first is a custom "Reminder," where the user enters a message they need to be persistently reminded about. They hit go and... well, that notification is there for good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) The second is a set of friendly, tough-love reminders that are pushed to the user's notification bar at semi-random time intervals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built entirely in Android Studio and tested on an Android 6.0 emulated device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The semi-randomly timed background service which pushes notifications was/is tricky. Still working at quirks at the time of the writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we were unable to test the application on an Android phone due to technical difficulties, so troubleshooting that/testing using an emulator wasted some resources and time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, apparently the newly released Android 7.0 - Nougat - does not like persistent notifications. So this app is not so practical as of.. a month ago.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works... sort of...?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Background services in Android are not super easy to deal with. Android 7.0 is crushing Doug's dreams of a world filled with persistent notifications.

                <p>
                    Development is unlikely to continue for this iteration of the application, but a more feature-rich version could be considered in the future.
