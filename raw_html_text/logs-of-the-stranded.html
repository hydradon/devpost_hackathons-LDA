                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed 'Choose your Own Adventure' games when I was younger, and I'm big into role playing games now. I've seen text based games before, and I thought it was a good thing to bring RPG video games and the experience of table-top games together. I also wanted to try my hand at world building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start by choosing your character's specifics. Then you are dropped in the middle of the world. The rest is up to you! You choose where you go, how you fight (if you fight), who you befriend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Windows Forms in Visual C# in Visual Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database I set up was my major drawback, it turns out the issue was it was saving to the debug database instead!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I successfully build a fully-working database on my own. Also, what I did in this short time can compare to almost my entire cs325 project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Specifics of a database, more in-depth features of Windows Forms and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Logs of the Stranded
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More options! More interactions! More world building! A combat system, more areas and enemies. Just more of everything.
                </p>
