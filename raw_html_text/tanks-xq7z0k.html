                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we were considering game using image processing and real-life components that the user was able to create themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tanks! is a multiplier game where the each player has a tank with 3 lives and tries to shoot the other tank. It exists on a battleground that is hand drawn by the user and processed into the game to become the obstacles that the users face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using image processing, joystick controls, and physics collisions that we created ourselves. It is developed in Java and XML for android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One significant challenge we faced was figuring out how the collision physics worked with a acceptable refresh rate as well as the solidity of the user-created obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having a significant amount of debugging, we gained a lot of experience while practicing our skills and are very proud of how successful our debugging was. We are also very proud of how we were able to connect all of the various parts into one working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this experience, we learned a lot about Git, Android Studio, XML, and especially debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tanks!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan on submitting it to the Google Play Store with new features such as power-ups, rubber bullets that ricochet, and different game modes.
