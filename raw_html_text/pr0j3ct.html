                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    They say true friends will always stay at your side no matter wad happens so we decided to create an extension just to test that theory out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It messes with people's minds and bring people to places that they dont want to go. 
Use it to truly test your friendship. 
Install this extension secretly into your friend's google chrome and enjoy the show.

                    How We built it

                    Our keyboards,

                    lack of sleep, 
lack of experience.

                <p>
                    we managed to finish it while getting sufficient sleep (i think).
