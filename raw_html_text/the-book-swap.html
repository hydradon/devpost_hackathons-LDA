                    Inspiration: Students buy books from over priced bookstore every semester. Then, when our semester is over, we accept pennies on the dollar for those books and cycle goes on and on, generating hundreds even thousands for the bookstores.

                    What it does: Through this website students and other users are able to sell, buy and swap their books among each other. They can sell to other students and can get up to 90% money back, and later this student can also sell his/her book with good price to another student and so on. Also, they can swap a book with another desired book from another user. Another feature is that if they cannot find their desired book in the sell/buy or swap items, they can put it in a wishlist and other user will be able to see the wishlist and send an offer if this user have this book.
