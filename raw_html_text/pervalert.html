                    PervAlert aims to provide quick support to victims of aggression or rape without having to require holding onto one&rsquo;s phone.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PervAlert was built on python and relies on google web speech API for speech recognition.
                </p>

                    What's next for PervAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge of the project was identifying plausible means of protecting and supporting a victim in a high-stress and high-risk situation.
Our group is proud of the fact that we were able to produce an app that has the potential to save lives or prevent the irreparable harm upon lives as a result of rape and aggression.
We hope to expand PervAlert by establishing a network among users enabling the identification of higher-risk areas. We also hope to implement a feature which can recognize impacts or falls by utilizing the phone&rsquo;s accelerometer.
