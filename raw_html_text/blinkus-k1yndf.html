                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We in Babashnik team tried to find new way to use our body in Virtual Reality.
We used our hands, legs, head...
But we newer used our eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So... Today, in our time technical progress and inovations in VR goes too fast and we can't blink anough fast to watch it. We are seriously!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most VR users forget to blink because they are very involved in game. It can make a lot of problems, like fatiguability of eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we solve it? Yes! Let's force users to Blink their eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems like new view of Google Cardboard. (or like strange black box with wires and leds :) )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our special vr-box with some extra elements.
By photo-resistor we receiving reflected by opened eye ray from low density IR-led and by using Arduino Leonardo we process sensors data.
Finally we can emulate PC Keyboard and receive Key Press in any application. (For example, in our simplest game) :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody in our team has knew Unity and only one of us has could write for Arduino.
And now All of us can do everything. It' like a indie-game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlinkUs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a time perspective we want to rewrite base algorithm, make more demos or standalong games using BlinkUs and provide it for the world.
