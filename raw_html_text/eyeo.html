                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Protecting lives by detecting tired and distracted driving using cheap, effective tools.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EyeO tracks drivers' eyes to detect when they are falling asleep. If it detects a driver falling asleep, it sounds a buzzer and flashes a light to wake the driver. The device is small enough to hang from a car visor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EyeO was built by combining OpenCV, a computer vision library, with Dlib, a machine learning library. By taking video of a driver's face, we can determine the aspect ratio of open vs. closed eyes. If the driver's eyes are closed for too long, we sound an alarm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EyeO runs on a raspberry pi and uses a web camera, so it would be cheap to manufacture and add to any car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dependencies are hell.
The raspberry pi has limited computational power.
Lack of prior experience with C++.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jumping into a new, complicated technology stack and creating a working product in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use OpenCV and Dlib.
Patience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EyeO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recording drivers' overall wakefulness and uploading it to a web site so they can track their driving habits.
Tracking driver wakefullness provides another metric for insurance companies that use driver behavior tracking devices.
