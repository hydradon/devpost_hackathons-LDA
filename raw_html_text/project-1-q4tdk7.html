                    Compartment Syndrome is a limb-threatening condition which is diagnosed based on clinical judgement due to lack of a reliable tool. In obtunded patients, a stryker needle is inserted to measure compartment pressure, however this has accuracy as low as 30% and low interobserver reliability. Compartment syndrome is sometimes missed, resulting in loss of function and even amputation. In other cases, surgeons err on the side of caution performing a very invasive procedure called fasciotomy which leaves large scars and significant deformation. We sought to create a device to diagnose compartment syndrome which would be easy to use, safe, and accurate.
