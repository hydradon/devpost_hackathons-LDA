                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by T-Mobile's initiative for a green lifestyle. Part of this initiative involves cycling. With T-Mobile's new campus expansion, cycling is taking a front row seat with DIY bike repair stations. We believe healthy commuting habits including cycling to work and being more connected with your transportation and with nature promotes a cleaner environment and a healthier body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system allows employees of T-Mobile who would like to borrow a bicycle to check them out for the afternoon to cycle to lunch with coworkers, or alternatively check them out daily for commuting purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Narrowband Developer Board to collect data about the bicycles, including location and push button sensor, in conjunction with an user-interface based on Twilio messaging system. There is also a web-based based administration panel that can track the location of each bicycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twilio Narrowband Developer Board to communicate with our API and the system was a really great experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, this is our first hackathon together and it was a fun experience to work together and build something new with this new technology!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating multiple systems including the Narrowband hardware, Microsoft Azure Serverless Function hosting, Twilio Flow, as well as our own front-end system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CycleShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build out more social features including group ride coordination, which increases safety and enjoyment of cycling. We also want to introduce cycling statistics for the user including average speed and distance traveled.
