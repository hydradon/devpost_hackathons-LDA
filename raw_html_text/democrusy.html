                    We decided to create a website that would help our local communities elect officials who catered to the specified needs of those who used our service. What inspired us was the upcoming 2020 election. We wanted a way in which we could amplify the people's voice and select the best candidate match to suit there needs.

                <p>
                    During the process, we learned about coding languages used in front end development (HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript) along with the backend frameworks (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB). Realizing that many people in our group have basic experience in web development we decided to go with Ejs as a view engine that renders HTML syntactical code to the DOM.

                <p>
                    Challenges like low web development experience and lack of time to learn made it difficult for designs for each webpage thus the web application was not fully complete or designed to the best of our abilities.
