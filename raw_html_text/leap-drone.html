                    Well, just fly a drone without a controller.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we have connected a Leap-Motion to an arduino through a computer.
then we have managed to connect the arduino to a drone controller using a protoboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We came with the idea that arduino has analog output pins, but we discovered that it only emulate them by PWM, that is a digital signal and doesn't work for emulating an analog potenciometer, that is what we wanted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally we solve this by using a low-pass filter, but for building them we need some capacitors that we haven't token from home, so we went to the city centre to buy them.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hacking a drone controller and pinch them using an arduino.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solving our problem with the lack of analog outputs using low-pass filters.
## What we learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned to use the SDK of Leap Motion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And we learned to use the arduino and his libraries.
## What's next for Leap Drone

                    <li>
                        Get a better drone because our is almost dead.
