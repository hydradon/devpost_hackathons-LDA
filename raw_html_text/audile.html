                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to reduce the amount of accidents on the road by informing our users about potential accidents ahead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our dataset contains reported pothole locations, upcoming pedestrian intersections and past accident sites to raise the users' awareness on the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application by combining several technologies together, including the Esri JavaScript API, React Native and Expo, Houndify, Heroku, and Node/Express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our chosen APIs didn't have available React Native libraries so we had to work on workarounds (such as using WebView and NodeJS) to get them to work cohesively with our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we came up with our idea fairly late, we were proud to have completed a working prototype in less than 24hrs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots about React Native components and WebView integrations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Audile
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering more data for our map, and implementing a voice UI so that the user doesn't need to look at their phone at all while driving.
