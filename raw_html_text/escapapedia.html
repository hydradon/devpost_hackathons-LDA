                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend realized that she would like to know her city more and told our team around a month ago. Although we never got a chance to actually work on the code, today our group decided to use this idea for an app as our submission to this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows its users to essentially get out of their comfort zone when it comes to what they are interested in. In short, a user that would like to try new places similar to their interests will be given suggestions on where they can go. People moving to new cities can also use the app to find new places that they might like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is built using C# and xaml with the .net framework. We used the xamarin API to help us build the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, our team decided to use an ESRI arcGIS API. After a few hours of making it work to how we wanted to, we found out the integration from arcGIS to xaml was impossible. Unfortunately, it was too late for any of us to make an entirely new map natively on xamarin, but the code for the acrGIS map is still on the github for people to view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being that this is our first time using the xamarin API, our ability to make readable and user-friendly UI within the 12 hours was something we are most definitely proud of. We also included GIFs and icons to make the UI much better looking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to use multiple APIs: ESRI arcGIS, xamarin, and Google APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escapapedia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Escapapedia has many updates on the way. We will implement a native map for the users to see. We will also add a reward system for users to step out of their "bubble" to better incentivize them going to new places. Better UI will also be implemented so that the user is comfortable using the app.
