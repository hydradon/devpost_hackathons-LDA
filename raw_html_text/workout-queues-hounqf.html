                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several "apps" that help us to track food or workouts. However, there isn&rsquo;t one that focuses on improving the overall engagement between Clients and Trainers. All these "apps" are independent and are not well integrated to benefit both Trainers and Clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At WorkoutQs, our mission is to become the de-facto platform for Personal Trainers. We are focusing on reducing the gaps in trainer-client engagement, thereby helping Trainers and Clients reach their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trainers can focus on creating workouts and we will use technology to improve client engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients will have access to workouts from a global pool of Trainers and they can engage on workouts with various technology choices.
