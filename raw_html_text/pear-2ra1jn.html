                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to know exactly where our money goes when we donate to charity, so we designed a transparent platform where people can directly fund specific causes, and to avoid the inherent corruption with conventional charity by removing the middle-man.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution creates a market for contractors to meet local needs through third party funders. Each funder takes an active role in deciding which contractor gets the job, and each beneficiary can vote on which contractor they believe provides the best solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Javascript tech stack, with Node.js (with Express and MongoDB) in the backend and AngularJS in the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably the greatest challenge was balancing the amount of frontend work necessary to demonstrate, with the amount of backend work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we've used our programming skills to make a meaningful human impact, and we all learnt a lot from the experience. We did not have years of experience with this technology stack so it was a very rewarding experience for all involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned frontend development is more frustrating that originally thought!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a secure payment system, and getting contractors involved. We need to make Pear the easiest way for communities to make their causes directly accessible to funders across the world.
