                    With students balancing different aspects of their busy lives, the hustle and bustle of everyday tasks can become overwhelming. This often leaves poor time management and increased levels of stress, and an overall increased cognitive load.

                <p>
                    Resonating with our target users, we find music as a viable solution to help ease stress and anxiety from daily tasks. Listen to music, relax, and take care &ndash;&nbsp;all with

                    We aimed to simulate the atmospheres and texture of the moods we believe are inherent to the human condition, especially to students. Productivity, staying healthy through exercise, sleeping, a nostalgia for our fading youth, and the spontaneous nature of life itself are all fundamental to the our well-being and humanity.
These categories are some of Spotify&rsquo;s most popular and most sought out, having hundreds of expertly crafted and curated playlists and APIs that we implemented into our own algorithms.

                    : 
From the interface, you have five different options to choose from. Upon choosing, our algorithms browse through libraries that take into account each track&rsquo;s audio features, honing in on the ones that match the selected mood.

                    : 
The timer allows the user to choose their desired timeframe to relax, work, or play. The algorithm  calculates the songs&rsquo; playtimes and creates a playlist, choosing songs from the library that is the length that you desire.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React (JS, HTML/CSS) on the frontend and Python &amp; Flask on the backend, we were able to integrate Spotify APIs to establish the connection between the two! 
Oh, and lots of energy drinks, coffee, and as little sleep as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For us developing the frontend, we had little to no experience using any of the tools. Learning JavaScript and React in 24 hours, and how to use APIs and databases, was quite challenging but incredibly rewarding. (...And staying awake was a bit challenging too!)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We reached all our goals for this project
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    everything is fully functional! Oh, and we think it looks pretty swell&ndash;we hope you do too.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    New languages, how to get the front and backend to communicate, what it means to be a collaborative and well-organized team, that it is
                    <em>
                        totally
                    </em>
                    possible to create your vision of things in 24 hours, and most importantly, it reminded us just how much we love and enjoy the whole entire process and why we're in tech.

                    We're hoping to implement/develop a mobile app for users to enjoy, and developing this into a full-fledged product! More features we hope to develop:

                        Reminders ("it's 2AM! maybe it's time to sleep?") to improve well-being and health.
