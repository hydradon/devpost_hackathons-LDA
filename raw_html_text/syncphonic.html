                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our frustration with the lack of a reliable playlist converter, coupled with the fact that we all use different music streaming platforms, lead to the conception of Syncphonic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncphonic reads the contents of a playlist, either from the user's Spotify or YouTube accounts, and stores them on our google cloud platform and app engine. From there, users can take these playlists from our cloud server and automatically create the same playlist in either Spotify or YouTube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took advantage of:
-Spotify Web API's playlist functions
-Spotipy, a lightweight python library for the Spotify Web API
-Youtube's Data v3 API 
-We constructed the backend using python, and the frontend using css, html, and python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our unfamiliarity with the APIs we used was our biggest challenge. Specifically, we had trouble navigating the user authentication process (OAuth v2) in both APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we had trouble understanding the Google cloud platform and app engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vast majority of our problems came from the fact that we had very limited prior experience when it came to working with APIs and hosting servers on Google cloud platform and app engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our frontend turned out to look very good, and many of the original features we hoped to implement eventually got implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the lengthy user authentication process that large companies like Spotify and YouTube require in using their APIs, the basics of Google cloud platform and app engine, and that sleeping for less than 2 hours in a 36 hour period is never going to be a good idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Syncphonic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more streaming platform options, as well as the sharing functionality we hoped to implement during this hackathon.
