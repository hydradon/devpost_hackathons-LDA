                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    Have you ever been attracted by a cuttie dog on the street but don't know what kinds of dog it is?
Don't Worry, PePuppy is right here for you! With a few simple operations, you will get all the information of the dog and the nearest location to adopt your own puppy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple click on the fuzzy icon to get start and you can choose either to take a photo of the dog or upload the photo from your album. Our app will identify the image and then show the information of the dog breed you are looking for!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our java-based android mobile app with Android Studio and registered the app on the Firebase platform to use its powerful toolkits. The app utilizes the Google Cloud APIs and ML Kit to label the photos and return the processed information about the identified dog breed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is the first hackathon for most of us, we bumped into many issues while building our projects. We spent plenty of time studying the new development platforms and APIs and have hard time customizing our configuration settings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although none of our team members has mobile development experience before, we made the idea of PePuppy come alive with a interesting Mobil App. From building framework to labeling images, we learned from scratch and failed so many times, but we finally did it! We also used Google Clouds to improve labeling accuracy, returning the specific breed of the dog instead of a general "dog" tag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to develop a fully-functioning android mobile app with Android Studio and used various APIs, such as ML kit, and Google Cloud Vision and Function APIs. It&rsquo;s fun to work in team and eventually build up to something we are proud of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll further optimize the accuracy of our app's labels by implementing our own classification models.
We would also like to perform the real-time query online to extract more exact and filtered information about the dog breeds, group, origin, habits and etc. We plan to use website crawler to get access to Wiki page and extract useful information for our users.
We would improves our UI to have more user-friendly features :)
There exists a privacy concern of the dogs that we may need to think more about in the future deployment of the app.
