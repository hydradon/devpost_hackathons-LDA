                    By contributing to a starting capital, users are able to make both their self-savings and co-savings depending on their preferred amount and cycle. Plus, during their saving period, the users could also gain interest with the lowest rate of financial risk, which sets up the foundation for their long-term commitment and confidence in Monty.
