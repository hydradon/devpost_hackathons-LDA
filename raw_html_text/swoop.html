                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no doubt that there is a transportation issue in California and around the nation as a whole. Public transportation is very limited, expensive and unreliable. As a college student I am always on the Go and in a desire to visit different cities around the state that can often bee 100 or more miles away. With having a large network of friends that attend other UCs it is difficult to see them without having the luxury of a car or a good amount of money. We said to ourselves there must be a solution to this problem considering the amount of cars driving on the road each day!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swoop is an on demand ride sharing app. Our mission is to make getting to destinations easier, affordable, and more eco-friendly than ever. Unlike other ride share pages and apps, Swoop offers a real time on-demand ride sharing service. Simply open the app at any time and view all the commuters headed to your desired destination. You will then be able to request a ride for a small price that we guarantee will be a fraction of what you pay for an Uber or Lyft. The reason our prices are so low is because they are set by commuters like you and me, who are just looking for a little gas money and are generous enough to pick you up on their way!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swoop was built using Javascript and deployed locally as a web app. We utilized the Google Maps API and real time data of coordinate points and and locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating our backend, which contained our data and coordinate points, to our front end, which contained our webpage layout, proved to be a more challenging task than we thought. The front-end had to constantly ping the backend for the new coordinates of the driver in order to make the driving as smooth and dynamic as possible.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first hackathon, we were proud to be able to participate and build something for the first time. We are happy to have learned new tools, technologies, and frameworks in JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to integrate multiple code bases that eventually led to a final working product. Along the way, we also learned to handle new technologies such as bootstrap and Google Maps API. Most importantly, we learned that through persistence and teamwork we can build anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Swoop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there is no doubt to the usefulness of an app like Swoop, challenges that need to be addressed are the scalability, popularity, and safety of such a program. For rates to be as low as possible, the app needs a large user base in order to have enough drivers and passengers who feel safe and comfortable enough to reuse the service again and again.
