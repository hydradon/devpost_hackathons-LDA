                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an online web game that utilized socket.io in order to accompany multiple players. It would have worked in a similar style to the popular "One in the Chamber" game, albeit with a top-down perspective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does not work 100% but we implemented a lot of the client-side + server-side. We found the hit detection between players difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js, socket.io, and javascript as our main technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has many scoping issues, especially concerning the use of the p5 framework, so implementing communication between our classes was difficult.
                </p>
