                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been inspired by the still unsolved problem of generating automated tests for any problem/function with any specification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a tool that you can use to generate test cases in order to validate new approaches/algorithms to a problem/function. Given a working function that you want to refactor/make run faster as well as your new optimized approach together with a set of specifications and/or edge cases, our tool generates a python file containing automatically written unit tests for your new function.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Supporting all common data types as well as with generating python code.

                <p>
                    We are proud to see out tool works for the examples we used for testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better code organization as well as improved object oriented programming skills.

                    What's next for Automatic test case generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to test more common failure points as well as wirte better documentation.
