                        sick looking rhythm game

                    in Japan and thought it'd be nice if I could play something like that at home. Existing VR rhythm games that tend to involve hitting the notes themselves weren't exactly what I was looking for.

                <p>
                    Cadenza!! is a WebVR rhythm game where you hit falling notes on a keyboard to the beat of music. On VR devices with hand controllers, the user strikes the keys using mallets. Without a VR device, the game can be played on keyboard or with a touchscreen.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before the hackathon, I had built a
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverFei_VR/status/1128516074129981440" rel="nofollow">
                        prototype for the game
                    </a>
                    with AFrame/three.js. This involved developing: a beatmap schema, note creation and music synchronization logic in order to play beatmaps, and collision detection logic in order to register/handle key hits. I also made a really basic beatmap making tool using Pixi.js which I used to create the prototype's beatmap. During the hackathon period, I built on top of the prototype game and tool.
