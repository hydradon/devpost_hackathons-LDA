                    ReachOut is a project that facilitates micro-lending to users in the most remote areas of the world. Lenders can make numerous small, high-return investments that allow borrowers to purchase crucial items such as fertilizer, young animals, agricultural tools, or spare parts.

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Text-free Login: Users create accounts by taking pictures of themselves, and login by clicking on their picture and entering a pattern lock.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text-free Proposal Generation: Users are given a sequence of audio prompts about their requested loan and how they will use it. For each prompt, user responses are recorded as text using Google&rsquo;s speech-to-text API. Users can play back their responses to verify that transcripts are accurate, and attach pictures to support their proposals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Database: Proposals are tracked in DynamoDB on Amazon Web Services, and stored data is used to calculate credit scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Easy access to funds: Accounts and transfers are managed automatically using Capital One&rsquo;s Nessie API. To withdraw cash from their loan, users allow a banker to type an account number into their their withdrawal screen, and the full amount of the loan is transferred.
                    </li>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Storing and retrieving data in DynamoDB required us to flatten our model, but we were able to do it without losing information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a web client that interfaced with DynamoDB and Nessie was very difficult.

                    <li>
                        Tracking a proposal through different states created a lot of unexpected difficulties.
