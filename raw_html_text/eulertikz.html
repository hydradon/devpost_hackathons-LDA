                <p>
                    The popular typesetting language, Latex, neatly supports auto-previews for mathematical formulas and equations within the sublime text environment. Unfortunately, live previews do not exist for drawing discrete graphs, also called networks. Also, in order to save time in drawing graphs for our courses, auto-generating Latex scripts from graphs drawn in a video will help a lot!

                <p>
                    Frequently ensuring correctness of code saves a lot of time and prevents unexpected bugs and crashes. Every member should be aware of the code written so far, collaborate code review is necessary for debugging code.
