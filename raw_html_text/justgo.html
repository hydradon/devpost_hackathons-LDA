                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about my love of travel. I was thinking about inspiration. I was thinking about where I will travel to next.
Then I came up with JustGo. A random location generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The intention of this app was to generate a random location for someone to travel to either locally by Uber or nationally and internationally by plane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using xCode and Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While creating the application I found I had to overcome a fare learning curve due to my lack of experience with swift as a language. I couldn't figure out how to do a few different aesthetic and user experience methods such as specific transitions I had in mind when thinking of the app, however, I still was able to make a visually appealing application. I spent a large amount of time figuring out what seemed to offer the most simple and fun design. This, however, proved to affect the time I put into the dynamics of the application (such as airfare/airtravel location).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just creating something that looks the way I envisioned it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to manipulate and achieve high quality animations, how to create graphics and a large amount of the how and why for swift.

                <h2>
                    What's next for JustGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge of JustGo was finding an AirFare API that didn't cost money. I would love to actually implement airfares for whatever locations the program generates. I also would like to create a list of actives that correlate with locations.
