                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the hefty bills lawyers charge when they read, also by the clutters in news and blog articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many people, I don't like reading a long winded article that it repeats itself, when essential information can just be covered by a few sentences.  I understand that's how writers get paid by word count, but too frequently it's a waste of readers' time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can even try Lawli app to demystify legal documents like the Mueller Report, just saying.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marketing the app without a budget has been a challenge to the get the word out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lawli
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of plans are in store at Lawli to provide the tools to access justice.  This app is simply a start, and we hope to build more amazing functions with funding in place to apply blockchain to legal services.
