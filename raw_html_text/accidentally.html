                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technology implemented in the most "up-to-date" (technologically enhanced) cars is not available to older versions. We wanted to help drivers with older car models to be safer on the road. This provides drivers with more awareness and reiterates the motto "don't text and drive". Hopefully, this will prevent accidents, accentuate the purpose of safety, and protect and benefit the community and its people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is intended to help drivers be more aware on the road and practice safe driving skills. It involves two parts, an app and a sensor. Depending on the make, model, and year of the car and the location you place the sensor, the sensor detects whether you are driving too close to the car in front of you and there is a car in one of your blind spots. For the app, you first create an account and indicate the details pertaining to the car you are driving. You may add more cars later. If you already have an account, after logging in, you are prompted to select the car you are driving and if applicable add a new car. Then, you are taken to the home screen where a map is displayed using GPS. You can decide to input a destination or not. Either way, you are able to visualize your car on the road. In operation with the sensor, the sensor beeps when you are too close to (within a certain distance from) the car in front of you or the app indicates in relation to your car where a car is in your blind spot. All this information from the sensor is stored in the app for recall and to recommend changes in your driving to improve safety, and you can access this data via the history screen. While there is a reminder not to text and drive, there is also a do not disturb button that blocks all notifications including texts and social media notifications and messages but hands-free calling is allowed. Do not disturb is intended to prevent unsafe driving by limiting distractions. There is also a feature to listen to music or podcasts while using the app.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Writing the code for the Arduino kit. Also, the ultrasonic sensor is extremely sensitive. Whenever you approached it, it would buzz even though nothing was in front of it. Calibrating the distance properly. Making sure the lights colored properly, red if something is in front of the sensor or green if nothing is in front of the sensor.
