                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest piece of inspiration was the possibility of just making a fun app that could help people get to know themselves better in an interesting and different way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to log in to your Facebook account in the name of letting the app see your posts. After this, the app uses machine learning to tell you(through relative percentages) what type of political attitude/vibe your post gives or resonates with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an iOS app, built on Objective-C and Swift. We also used Express.JS(via Node.JS) for our backend infrastructure to serve our iOS app's Indico needs, and also handle other calls. We also used HTML,CSS, and more JS(jquery, etc.) to develop our front-end web application.  We hosted our backend on Google Cloud and consumed the Facebook and Indico APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges in everything from buggy iOS UI threads that needed to be discovered, learning how local mongodb servers work, and especially when we continued to deploy express.js code(after multiple attempts) to serve our iOS app's needs correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of everything from quick iterations on the iOS side of things to collaborations, changes, and knowledge attained through the entire development process. Most particularly, the Indico API did not have a modern, correctly working iOS SDK, so we developed a node.js application to take care of our Indico API needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how accessible very complex areas of computer science can be as a result of APIs that make anything possible. I also learned how confusing it can be when large companies roll out buggy SDKs, which end up leading to old posts dominating forums, which ends up not helping me solve problems quickly. Also, our knowledge of web development via full stack JS, cloud deployment(Google Cloud), and iOS grew a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Post Politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If well received, up next is twitter integration since people tend to post more rapidly on Twitter(thus the data is more valuable with regards to showing political preferences).
