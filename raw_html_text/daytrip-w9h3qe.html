                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vikas was in Yellowstone over his summer break. He encountered multiple difficulties with planning and scheduling, especially since his family knew absolutely nothing about Yellowstone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He yearned and he yearned, for an app that would whisk away his issues. But all he got, was a tissue.
Now comes a contender, all alone. Ready to be more than just bone.
Oh code and code did Vikas and Jason. Time, the eternal guardian being the foremost frustration.
Out of this HackMIT companionship, did rise a dayTrip.
