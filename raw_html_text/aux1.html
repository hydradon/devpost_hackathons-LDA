                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hated sharing the auxiliary cord and dealing with the bombardment of requests. Why can't we just let everyone have access to the speakers?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aux allows a host user to login into their Spotify account and create an empty playlist, identified by a pin that can be shared with other listeners. After someone has the playlist pin or 'Aux code', they can access the request system for that playlist. The request system queries Spotify's library and allows the requested songs to be voted upon. Every few minutes, the top requested song is queued into the party playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Aux using Spotify's API and a Flask server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Python API wrapper we used, Spotipy, made it difficult to get authorization for the host account in an elegant way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished so much this weekend: running a server locally, accessing and generating a user playlist, and implementing a live voting and priority queue system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group has learned a lot about front and back-end development, specifically experimenting with JS, Angular.js (although unsuccessful), and Flask. We also became more experienced in live API integration, including dealing with poorly documented features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Aux
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, Aux has to be cleaned up and become more presentable. After this point, it can begin to be scaled to allow many hosts and parties to be occurring simultaneously. Additionally, we would like to implement 'global parties' with public playlists connecting people worldwide. We also would like to implement web player capabilities to keep our entire application in one location.
