                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it easier for everyone to start building an application so they can focus on building the app and not setting it up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a template that you can simply download and with a little knowledge of command line, you will be able to have a web application in few minutes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use some existing too plus some of our own design format to make sure everything linked and works well together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generalizing it so everyone can use is quite difficult. We hope to solve this by writing a detail documentation.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get it to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    some new React skill
                </p>

                    What's next for Material React Application Starter Kit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more documentation so everyone from beginning to advance can use this project.
