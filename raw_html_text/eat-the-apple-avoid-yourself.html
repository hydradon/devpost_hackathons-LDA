                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that was at our skill level (beginner) but also very fun and addictive
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You use the arrow keys to navigate your way through a designated area for the snake and try to eat the apple. Once you start to get bigger and bigger you have to be mindful to not accidentally eat yourself (resetting the entire game)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML coding and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running code for different details such as the length of the snake and the size of the border
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing and finishing our first HTML code game on time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons provide insight and extra knowledge (if you don't know a lot) on hacking and creating projects with code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eat The Apple Avoid Yourself
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bigger more complex version, including a bigger border so the snake can double its size without too much difficulty
                </p>
