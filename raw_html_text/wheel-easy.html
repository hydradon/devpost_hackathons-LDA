                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that a real smart city is one which seeks to facilitate the lives of all their inhabitants, especially the ones who have special needs. Traveling when you are in a wheelchair can be very difficult especially when staying in hotels. A hotel room advertised as wheelchair-friendly will probably have been designed with certain norms but that does not make the room or even the hotel truly accessible for a person in a wheelchair. The only people who can truly attest to a room's accessibility are the people who have the mobility restriction. Our platform will enable them to do so and to share this information with the restricted-mobility community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A platform that will enable users to find wheelchair-friendly hotels in montreal and see reviews made by other people with their mobilty restrictions. Users are encouraged to review places themselves to build a rich database to help their own community directly.

                <p>
                    We would like to implement different tabs on the website that would contain different maps for different disabilities. Ex a tab for people who have decreased visibility could include hotels who accept guide dogs.
