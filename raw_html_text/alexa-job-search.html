                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the idea when pursuing my own job hunt. I could not find an Alexa skill, which helped me find a job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can search for a job for a particular role. You can also filter the search results by City. Alexa will read out the job for you. You can also ask for experience and the technologies required for the particular job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leveraged the GitHub jobs API, and built a Flask app using the awesome Flask-Ask framework, to build out the voice interface. I parsed the job description for getting the experience and the technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a voice interface that works was the challenging aspect. Also, I initially faced problems in storing context (A single job result). It took quite some time to resolve the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working Alexa hack on the Skills Store. Also, the code is relatively clean, thanks to the Flask-Ask framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Skill basics, deploying stuff to AWS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Job Search
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to link Gmail accounts, so that the skill can email details about the job to the user. Also, right now the app is restricted to the US. I would explore a way in which I can implement it for the entire world.
