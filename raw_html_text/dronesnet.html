                <p>
                    We researched the current problems in air traffic control system. Airport traffic control has become really mature and has been developed for the last 100 years. However, there is no such system for commercial drone (UAV) fleets control. Unregulated drone traffics had caused a lot of a trouble, such as harming plane and other UAVs. A drone regulation system is highly related to everyone because of the popularity of commercial drones, the lack of understanding of FAA UAV regulations, and the threat of drones to our traffic system.

We set timelines for each phase to ensure our progress and reduce risks. We put sticky notes on a whiteboard (thanks NSA for providing those awesome sticky notes!) and organized them by different phases.

                        We were trying to deploy

                            AIRMAP's API

                        . Their API contains all the accurate FAA regulation area based on real-life locations. However, our API request is not being approved.

                    We decide to do research on all those regulations and recreate air zones regulations based on those information.

                    <li>
                        We also had difficulty finding light weight accurate 3D geo-mapping of a real city. They are either not web-compatible or too slow to load.

                        Solution:

                    Why it matters
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Remotely informs the users (individual, commercial user, and government agency) about regional drone activities in an interactive way. Users can also enter the FPV of their own drones. Raise air traffic publicity and awareness for the general public.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better security control: Regulate both individual and commercial drones, provide and Traceable drone activities as well as warning/reporting for airports. It also generate flight route automatically to prevent collisions. There is no such system of its kind for commercial drones or UAVs yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduced significant cost in drone monitoring and regulations. Our system also provides new way for drones to navigate. Drones no longer need expensive camera and sensors. All the navigation could be done by a centralized and connected system, significantly reduces cost and the weight of drones
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sustainable for future development and deployment. Easy to access (website). Easy to add integration to the system.
