                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the offseason, my teammates and I all need to stay fit for the upcoming sports season, and instead of emailing our coaches for workout ideas everyday, we could just make an app for it.
                </p>

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes the user through a series of questions to personalize the workout for the user. Ideally, the workouts would change every day and gradually increase in difficulty as a user uses it. However, we did not have the time to code every single workout. To see working demos, try clicking the following: Legs &gt; Easy &gt; Under 18, Arms &gt; Medium &gt; 30-55, and Abs &gt; Hard &gt; 30-55.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We actually had a completely different idea originally in which we would use the Twitter API to analyze tweets and send users text messages when the tweets showed signs of sadness. However, due to difficulties learning how to connect to the Twitter API and Firebase, we could not follow through, which also limited our time when making a new app.
