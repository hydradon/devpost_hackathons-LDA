                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since VandyHacks VI wanted us to code a masterpiece, we created a game that anyone can code a masterpiece in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this game the user starts with a blank slate and a set of blocks to create any world that they desire. With this world, they then can add creatures and energy sources so that they may thrive and compete with each other in different environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using the Unity Game Engine in C# using a grid based system to track mouse movement and clicking. We also built a user interface we know people will love to work in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was implementing the ability for voxel mobs to move around the world randomly and then track towards food or resources when those came into their sense range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the grid-based building system proved to be more challenging than we initially though, but we were proud with how good our implementation was when we came up with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the importance of keeping code organized and readable when working in a group. When you get to 10-15 files with thousands of lines of code it can be difficult to remember what does what. We also learned a lot about C# and coding in Unity. This was one of my first times working on a big unity project and we definitely got a lot out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Voxel Universe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement a wider range of creatures, more building blocks, and a smarter AI for the creatures. We hope to expand this game into a larger platform that can simulate why certain mutations of a more accurate simulation of the way a population grows and evolves. When coming into VandyHacks knowing it was art edition we wanted to create something that people would love the look of and have fun using while also learning about how species live in an environment with natural selection.
