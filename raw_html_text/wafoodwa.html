                    We came into this with absolutely zero experience with web development. After many (many many) hours of tutorials, we were able to create the website. With -5 minutes to spare, we managed to fix our code!

                    Both of us learned new things and worked on the opposite of our inclinations. One person did the Javascript while the other worked on the HTML and CSS. We learned new languages and had a great time.
