                <p>
                    MoveMentor matches forcibly displaced students with practicing teachers who volunteer as remote tutors to keep students on track in their education and as mentors to offer personal support and connection to their host country or region.

                <p>
                    Education:

If access, often temporarily understaffed (reliability)
Personal Development:
Lack of personal/cultural connection to host country/region
Lack of knowledge about host country/region
Lack of integration into host country/region
Lack of simple psychological support
Volunteering:
Lack of meaningful opportunities
Geographical distance
Relevance to skillset
Direct/tangible impact
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consequences
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refugee students:
Severe setbacks in educational progress
Potentially complete dropout of education
Alienation from host country/region
Volunteer teachers:
Lack of engagement in social issues
Apathy, feeling powerless
Alienation from foreign cultures
                </p>
                <p>
                    CONCEPT
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vision: No student in need left behind
Mission: To support forcibly displaced students in their personal and educational development through continued mentoring and tutoring
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pitch
                </p>
                <p>
                    MoveMentor matches forcibly displaced students with practicing teachers who volunteer as tutors to keep students on track in their education and as mentors to offer personal support and connection to their host country or region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MoveMentor does not replace local schools or teachers but rather complements them or acts as an intermediate bridge between times of limited access to schools. Where possible, students are matched with teachers from the same region, country or wider culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MoveMentor operates on the principles of a flipped classroom where students learn largely by themselves and check in with the teacher once in a while to discuss questions and progress. We match one one teacher per student but teachers can take on several students.
