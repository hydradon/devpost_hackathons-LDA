                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that the transfer of files in the modern age of information was far too slow and insecure. In order to transfer files, the contents of the files and the information of the users goes through a centralized database. That allows for insecure networks where data can get lost. Now, what if we told you that secure, fast, and decentralized applications can help rule that out?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peer to peer file transfer and file share.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Files were first added to IPFS. Their content hashes were then encrypted and placed in a distributed hash tree after validation by the other users. Files were then retrieved from IPFS using their content hashes.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an alternative to traditional block chains and transferring files faster and safer.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using UDP for peer to peer connections on local networks and different methods of distributing data on a decentralized network.
