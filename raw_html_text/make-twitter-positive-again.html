                    MakeTwitterPositiveAgain is a program aimed at making Twitter a more friendly community. Our program allows user's to type in anyone's twitter handle, and as long as their profiles are public, our problem will collect all of their past tweets. It will then analyze how positive or negative each tweet was, using the Indico API. It will then collect all of the individual tweet scores, and average them out in order to display to the user their average positivity score. Our program will also analyze the various emotions in each tweet, and display to the user how often these emotions came up. Another function of our program is that we allow the user to type in a tweet, and our program will try to predict how well received the tweet will be.

                    Our program was developed in Java for the back end operations such as storing the data. We used JavaFX for our front end, and the Indico API for analyzing the text. Twitter4J was used to collect the tweets from Twitter.
