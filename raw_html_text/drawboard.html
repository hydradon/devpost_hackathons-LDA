                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was walking in the street when I was in need to send a very simple map of where I was. That's when I realized that a keyboard that can send simple images as text would be very useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a matrix of 16x8, you can draw on it and then send it with characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use android-studio.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noone.

                <p>
                    Create a keyboard, which is not as simple as you can imagine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about android-studio and its functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DrawBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to show in the keyboard which keys are pressed. But that's not on our level so we are not going to do that.
