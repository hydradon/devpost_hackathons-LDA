                    While taking physics classes, we found it difficult to figure out which physics equation was necessary for a given problem. After all, there is a plethora of physics equations. As a result, we developed the Physics Equation Solver for Oakland University's GrizzHacks Competition. The Physics Equation Solver helps take the stress out of physics, as it includes 20+ mechanical equations. Along the way, we solved some of our development problems such as the user entering incorrect input, the algorithms used to match the variables with equations, and configuring GitHub for collaboration. Now that the Physics Equation Solver is complete, users will have an easier time solving physics problems.
