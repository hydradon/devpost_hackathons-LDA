                    Facial-recognition-based library management packaged in a python script
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're a team of first years who have no idea what we wanted to do, so it was either something using facial recognition or something related to real time audio streaming, those were what we felt most comfortable making. In the end we settled for facial recognition, following a similar functionality to what Apple does with its images on the iPhone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided that the program must contain the following core functionality:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Request for a folder of images
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scan the images for faces, grouping together similar faces
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tag the faces by copying each group of images to a folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user identifies the group by renaming the folder with the common person's name.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We split the workload by having 2 members work on frontend and 2 on backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on the frontend, our biggest challenge was getting tkinter to do what we had in mind, and deciding the flowchart for the program usage. Also implementing a friendly user interface
The backend had to implement the facial recognition of images into code, that sorts the all the images that contain a person into one folder, and does this for all the people that appear in the photos.
