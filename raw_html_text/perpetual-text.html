                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by Ethereum's potential to decentralize power and control and empower the common person.  Our goal was make a simple application that demonstrates that potential and learn along the way.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a NodeJS framework with Redis and PostGREs backends.  A single page application (SPA) view connects to the NodeJS API's making calls to the Ethereum blockchain.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first blockchain project there was a learning curve.  The literature before the event was excellent, but practical knowledge proves humbling. In 36 hours we were proficient enough with Ethereum to save and retrieve contracts on the network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe, albeit with little sleep, building out the solution made during the Hackathon will allow people not familiar with blockchain to learn more about the technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ethereum smart contracts are powerful. We can see how the technology can grow into a more integrated and scalable solution in future iterations.
