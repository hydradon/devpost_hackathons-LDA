                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first hackathon and I have never coded a game or any graphics at all in Python so wanted to learn something new. I love video games so I made a game mimicking Legend of Zelda but with references to other games and satirical/sarcastic comedy regarding certain interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game mimics a platformer's motion physics, allows for exploration and interaction with certain elements of the environment, and displays introductory graphics rendering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python 3.6.4 and pygame, and the functions available in those two, I built the game almost from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Physics are very hard to write from scratch especially when you don't want to use anyone else's libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to create a short, working game which although has very minimal interaction/action, was more than I expected to make when I came here yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use pygame and make quite a fun game, at least in my opinion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackPoly2018 - Definitely Not a Zelda Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to write some short audio tracks for the different zones in my game and sound effects for different interactions but a lack of experience and knowledge in coding games led to a lack of time for that. I would also like to clean up the code because it is poorly written.
