                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an application which combined our various skills and could have an impact on a societal need. We found that as the internet becomes a larger part of our lives, technology can be used as a driving tool to help those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows a user to log journal entries, in which they write about certain aspects of their day or week. We take this data and do sentiment analysis using Google-Cloud-NLP. We then display their growth on the website to show their progress over a certain time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our backend in python and integrated it to a web app using angular.js and node.js. We used google-cloud-nlp to send our data to receive a confidence interval.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble integrating the backend python application in with our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a functional application and we all learned about a new piece of software along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GrowthML
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more to the user experience as that is what will draw attention to our app. We also want to integrate google assistant as it would be easier for the user to communicate their thoughts.
