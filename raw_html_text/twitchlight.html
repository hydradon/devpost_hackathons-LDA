                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this project through the Streamer known as Wish. She requested at this hackathon that we create a way for streamers to celebrate subscribers more substantially. When we saw the LED strip in the MLH kit, we knew immediately that it would be something cool to work with. This project is also useful for streamers to increase their brand presence if they are able to get a custom design for the setup with their branded logo. It becomes an integral part of the stream if done correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, it is able to allow various interactions with a streamer in their workplace (also home) by allowing certain events to trigger light changes through subscriber events, and also be used to share results of a basic polling app by changing the light to a colour that maps to an option and also displays various visual elements on the overlay to complement this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino 101 hooked up with a NeoPixel LED Strip as a microcontroller to change the lights as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the backend we used node.js to be able to parse the incoming chat streams and send that data to the LED lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the frontend overlay on Twitch, we simply used HTML and JS to get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up LED's is difficult if you don't know what you're doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to control lights makes you feel pretty powerful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Arduinos and basic hardware setups!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitchlight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can create an easy to use extension that allows streamers to easily adapt and use our extension while also being entertaining for the community. This extension will hopefully be used to not only react to subscribe events but also other things like donations, community achievements or even the streamers facial expressions!
