                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began our journey with a few adventurous innovations yet concluded to one single point, to create a machine learning based UI Path data scrapper. The inspiration arrived from the idea of simplifying search for more sophisticated terms and products which usually have inaccurate search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning data scrapper can be used for a wide variety of purposes, whereby we focused upon narrowing down results of E-commerce businesses, namely Amazon and E-bay. The user inputs a certain product or category part of the aforementioned businesses and the scrapper seamlessly searches both websites and scraps the most relevant results to your search query and displays them on another external web-page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product was constructed using a range of various languages such as XAML, Bootstrap, JavaScript all molded together using the UI Path Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several challenges with this project, especially the lack of experience all of our team members had with UI Path, a studio which none of us had ever used before. There were many issues in searching and scrapping web-pages where at times, certain web-pages or various search results would render hard coded data rather than the required results from user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of and things I've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the Hackathon,  we achieved several goals including our accomplishment of learning majority of the UI Path studio during the event as well as gaining greater expertise in collaboration and improved application in error handling techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UI Path to Success
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To implement machine learning techniques to cluster items based on the latest and most cost effective deals which provide the greatest benefit for the user in terms of both economic cost and product quality.
