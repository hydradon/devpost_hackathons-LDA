                    We thought the idea of self driving cars was very interesting, so we wanted to make an RC car with the groundwork for creating self driving algorithms.

                    The rover acts as a RC car and the glove acts as the remote control. In addition, the rover has an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the front which tells us if there is an object in front of the rover. As the rover approaches an object, the haptic motor in the glove vibrates more quickly.

                    We used Atom with the add-on, Platformio. Atom has the functionality of built in GitHub making collaboration much easier. The code is all in Arduino.

                    Haptics were not PWM, but we thought they were, We forgot to bring the right wires, we forgot our multimeter meaning we had to be very careful with charge, the ultrasonic sensor timing was different than it was supposed to be

                    Getting accurate distance measures even though the ultrasonic timing was different. We each brought different skills to the table, and were able to create a great project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use haptics and ultrasonic which we have never used before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have some groundwork, we can continue on with the idea of self driving cars and create a basic self driving program.
