                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to contribute to the development of translation app,because we all know how important communication is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a logo and our own design for the app. At present it is able to translate text from one language to another, displaying the translated text back to the user. Also it uses the phone`s camera to detect text and display it on the screen. We wanted it to be able to take pictures of text , translate them and read them out to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java in Android studio as well as Google`s Translation API and the Android - cloud vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not use Git Hub so we had problems putting the project together from different computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of our design and the team work.

                    We learned about API`s and the importance of Git Hub. Also how to use basic functions and insert API key
