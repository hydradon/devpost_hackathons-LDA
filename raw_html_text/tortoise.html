                    We were inspired by people who are not able to give themselves the push to go outside and connect with others, or those who have just moved to a new place and don't know where good places to build a community would be. We created a sweater that has a small microphone inserted into the neck. This microphone records when the last time you spoke was, and, if has been more than four hours, it will send an alert that will in turn send a notification through the app to your phone that checks in and see's why you have not spoken in so long. It will then personalize a recommendation on where you should go to get more human interactions, if you are studying go to a local cafe. If you aren't sure where to go for fun in the winter, go to an open mic or the rec center. The suggested locations will have gone through a vetting process where anything rated below 3.5 stars will not be suggested so as to make sure the places people visit will be fun and positive. This idea was hard to flesh out due to technical difficulties in programming the microphone and trying to find a fabric that will not create static that could damage the device. Most of the logistics of creating our garment was considering the right tech to get the information we needed. once we found the microphone that worked best for our project it was all about programming it. As fashion majors, we had no idea how to program but after a few hours we had gained enough understanding about coding to tell the microphone to do what we wanted. We have learned a lot about the tech world and this process was also very helpful for us freshmen to understand how to design, create and execute a project in very little time.
