                    The functionality of this project is for a user, like you, to input a name for your rap song.  Using a collection of rap albums, we generate a unique rap song, for you, based on the name!  To accomplish this, we build a markov chain that learns what words frequently appear after others, then generates lyrics related to key words from your input.  While generating sentences, we have a lightweight  grammar to ensure that your lyrics make some sense (even though most rap songs already don't).  Lastly, we built in a sorting algorithm to put lines that rhyme next to each other, so your rap song sounds even better!  Now, all you need to impress your friends on your upcoming mixtape is a good voice (easier said than done)!!!!!
