                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a web app that would be useful to people stuck in disaster affected regions, but didn't want to write a phone app because not everyone has a phone, or has the app downloaded. An easy way to gather a lot of information in an affected zone is to ask the people who are already there. This way, we could have live updates on the developing relief effort and keep track of these victims at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is used by two kinds of people. The first are victims in the affected area who need to reach out to responders for aid. The second are responders who need information to aid these victims. The victims are able to send in media, which would inform these responders exactly what kind of situation they are walking into. In addition, the victims are able to access maps and other data on where to get supplies and/or medical help and "safe zones" nearby the affected areas. They are provided with maps with the shortest routes to these "safe zones." A possible addition to this would be allowing victims to notify others of affected areas that are not passable. This program also takes into account how urgent Victim's needs care as well as Victim populations in affected areas in order to prioritize resources in the area. As for the responders, those who are not in the area are prompted to donate money. However, those close enough are given other options such as donation of supplies and services, such as transportation.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website using HTML and CSS as the front end to gather information from these users. And then, we took this data and placed it into a database, using Django framework. Then we read this data and analyzed it in python. Some examples of this would be population density analysis, victim urgency, and creation of safe zones.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since everyone was basically new to the concepts of databases, APIs, webapps, CSS, HTML, other unrelated topics that were explored, and integration of these parts, we had trouble with everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop this application despite starting with zero knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs, HTML, CSS, Django, Flask, JQuery, installation for many of these programs, and databases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, Disaster Response Care Technology can also evolve by allowing for different methods of user input. This allows victims to send more information for these responders to analyze in order to deliver resources and aid safely. We could also make the transition from the information on the website to local authorities more smooth and vice versa.
