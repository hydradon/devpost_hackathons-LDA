                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everyday we have this problem: we need to park our car but we don't have the time to waste searching for a parking lot. InternetOfParking aims to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration is a practical case that is implemented using our vision for the product:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Allow the access to &lsquo;geographical and physical services&rsquo; (parking slots) managed by a Partner (Parking Area Manager) on a Digital Channel for all the Subscribers/Consumers of a Telecom Operator (CSSP)"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the user to find a parking lot with empty spaces. It also enables the parking lot owners to have more customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C#, ASP .NET, TMForum API, Huawei API and City of Lisbon API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with people that we didn't knew before, with a short deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using TMForum API, Huawei API and City of Lisbon API in a simple manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The using of mature APIs is easier, efficient and effective, rather than develop everything by ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned that this is the future.
                </p>
