                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Less than a year after immigrating to the US, my mom broke her leg after falling off a ladder while trying to clean the gutters.  My dad was at work and none of my siblings were born yet. She tried calling 911, but due to her accent and unfamiliarity with English, they couldn&rsquo;t understand her nor could they find her location, so they had to put her on hold while they tried to reach the emergency translators. She laid on the ground for over 10 minutes before our neighbor found her and called 911. I didn't want anyone else to risk losing a loved one due to not being able to communicate with 911.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has a variety of features that help 911 operators locate you. When the Life Ring is pressed, a list of emergency contacts as well as the police with be texted a help message along with your current GPS coordinates. The app then calls 911 and plays out your GPS coordinates so that if 911 texting is not available, the police can still locate you. It also lets you click a series of buttons to automatically text 911 and your emergency contacts without ever pulling out your phone so if you are in a situation where you must be discrete, you can still get help.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android does not allow you to pass audio through the phone call.
