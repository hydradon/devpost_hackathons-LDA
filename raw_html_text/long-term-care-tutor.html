                    This skill is intended to help Area Agencies on Aging train their volunteer HICAP (Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program) Counselors to help the seniors in their area.
For HICAP Counselors in California and those planning to be one, this quiz will help them familiarize with the Long-Term Care subject matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By answering the questions in this quiz, the student Counselors will be more aware of the different insurance options for Long-Term Care services and standards governing their practice (e.g.  in the State of California). They will find using voice to respond to the multiple-choice questions an easier and more natural way to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on previous experience with multiple choice type challenges, I developed the Long-Term Care materials with help from the subject matter expert at the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using automated, interactive voice for training has never been attempted in this agency. The challenge is to convince the staff that it is an effective way to train their counselors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Katharine Raley trains her HICAP counselors at the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging (VCaaa). &ldquo;When working with students one-on-one or in a small group setting, the instructors can quickly identify areas that require more work based on their observation and from the result provided at the end of each session.&rdquo; She said. Katharine is looking forward to using this skill to work with her counselor students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experienced HICAP Counselor can use this quiz to keep up with their professional skill, and go back to the guide book whenever they feel the need to review the details some more.
They can challenge themselves every time they have a chance, by starting the quiz whenever they are next to an Echo device with this skill enabled, or with the Alexa app on their cell phone or other mobile device supporting the app. With quick feedback to every answer they provide, they can familiarize themselves with the subject matter again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this skill to proof the concept is only the beginning. The approach could apply to other subject matters and to all 33 area agencies in California and elsewhere in the country.
