                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Skyrim is fun, make it more fun.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changes the built-in sound effects assigned to different animal and plant NPCs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Skyrim Creation Kit, along with recording and editing our own sound effects (91 total).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NPCs behave differently and so have different places for different noises. Organizing all of them was a tricky task. The creation kit had also never been used before, so that was learned.
Creation kit is also outdated and crashes often due to a bug on newer systems.
