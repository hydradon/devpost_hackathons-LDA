                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a game called The archers 2 that allows a high integration between finger gestures and the game. We decided to extend this game to 3 dimensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player uses swipes to shoot a volley of arrows at flying fishes. The score is dependent on the accuracy of the arrows.
                </p>

                    This was created using unity game engine and exported using android studio to android devices.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game contains many interdependent parts which made distributions and collaboration difficult. 
Furthermore we had many, it won't build it won't build events.
