                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When your friend shares a song with you from one streaming service and you can't use the link because you use a different streaming service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StreamBridge is a python library that interfaces with streaming services for the purpose of finding music content, or transferring playlists and libraries between services. Currently we support Google Play Music and Spotify, but our platform is designed to allow other providers to be added easily. In order to demonstrate a use case for this library, we hacked together a web app that takes a url from one streaming service and translates it to the same content another streaming service by extracting metadata from the streaming service's api and using that metadata to locate the same content on the output streaming service.
