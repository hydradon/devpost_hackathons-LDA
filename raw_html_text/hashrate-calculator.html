                    The catallaxy challenge really inspired us. The blockchain technology has been a real innovation for our world. One of its main usage is in cryptocurrencies. With the growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin new threats appear; attacks, frauds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our calculator has two main functions. First, it can be used by third parties to verify that the number of bitcoins a miner has earned is coherent with his hash rate, i.e. his capacity, his power of mining. Then the calculator can also be used by a miner itself. Knowing his hash rate, his power cost and power consumption, he can predict how much bitcoins he can earn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The calculator was built using the block-chain equations. We used javascript and html to have a web interface. CSS was used to make the interface look better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main objective was to have a calculator that evolves with time. In order to do that, we used APIs to obtain real-time values like the current difficulty. This method can be re-used for other time-changing values, like rewards, btc to usd conversion, etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints, we could not implement every functionalities everywhere. For now, only the difficulty value will be the real-time difficulty value. We also wanted to implement a evolution of the difficulty and the rewards, to make the user able to calculate older hash rates. Our biggest challenge was to understand the block-chain mechanics. It took a long time to learn about its functioning and understand the basic concepts of the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team is really proud of what we acoomplished. We managed to not only learn new technical skills, but also how to cooperate as a team, manage our time and global organization. We learned a lot from this hackathon and now that we discovered the impressive mechanics of the blockchain, we are ready to take it a step further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hash Rate Calculator still has a lot of things to improve. First, we want the implementation of more currencies that only Bitcoin. Then, improve our user interface and allow the user to go back in the history of blockchains to compute what the hash rates looked like before. We also have to improve small details, like correcting the text when switching from Hash Rate to Bitcoin Mined. Finally, we would like to automate the calculator if only the bitcoin address is automated.
