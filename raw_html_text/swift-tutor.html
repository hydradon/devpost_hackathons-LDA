                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tutoring hasn&rsquo;t changed much since its inception online. Hiring a tutor gives you a plethora of other problems to worry about like sending emails, making sure you hire a tutor worth the money, finding a place to study, finding someone cheap, etc.. Among the many tutoring services out there, only a few stand out like Khan Academy or Princeton Review However, among all of there, not one company really meets the needs of college students. Most students enjoy and learn more during an in-person tutoring session. Scholarly solves that problem.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scholarly gives you on-demand tutoring anytime and anywhere with a nearby tutor. Sets appointments, rate tutors, chat, screenshare in real time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scholarly is an Android App built with Java, Parse, XML, and Moxtra API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Moxtra into our app was very difficult for us. Also Building a real time, two way channel for tutors and clients to communicate and keep each other updated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very excited for Moxtra integration as it makes Scholarly ten times more valuable for people far away. Creating an efficient index searching query.
