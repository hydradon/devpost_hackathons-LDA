                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A hand band that detects oxygen saturation, pulse and breathing rate of a person, which upon detection of abnormal reading, will alert relevant parties for help without intervention of the wearer.  Upon activation, the first responder will be alerted of patient's location, and patient's physical condition will be streamed live on their platform.
