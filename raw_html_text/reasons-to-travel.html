                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important life hacks you can have these days are ones that improve your health. And few things are as healthy as taking a trip outdoors.But it's so hard to actually get to it! I felt having a reason to get out, that outshines the great excuses we come up with to not, would be incredibly helpful.

                    Every time you invoke Reasons To Travel, it responds with (you guessed it!) a great reason to get out and have fun!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using a python backend hosted on AWS Lambda, and the Alexa Skills Kit.

                    Getting great reasons to travel, of course! But with a bit of help from the world wide web, I was able to find some pretty convincing ones.
