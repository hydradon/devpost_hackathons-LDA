                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning to make a crash algorithm to help prevents crashes for cars, but that was too large for us to handle, so we came up with this idea after we had all of our materials and that nothing worked from our previous idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays notes and musical sounds of a piano, while being controlled through hand motions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Leap's API on python and the pygame library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to do multiple inputs at a time and doing multiple octaves for more accessibility in notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a functional app that will be all controlled through motion and gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Leap Motion's API for Python and to always have backup ideas in case something does not work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Musical Motions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To incorporate more instruments that can be played with motion and to allow for a greater range in notes.
                </p>
