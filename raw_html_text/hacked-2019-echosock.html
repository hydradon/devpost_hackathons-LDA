                    We were joking about making a smart sock but we ended up STOCKING people instead. ;)
We spread multiple ESP32 boards at various locations.
Each ESP32 board detects other devices nearby via bluetooth.
It then sends the number of devices detected every ten seconds to the Google Cloud IoT server.
The data is then pulled using a python script that displays the data into an html/javascipt file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given more time and resources, we would have done the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We used two ESP32 microcontrollers at each location- one for the bluetooth and the other for sending the data via wifi because of ram shortage.
If we had RAM memory expansions, one ESP32 would have been sufficient and we could have covered more locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We would also gather and send information about the MAC addresses for the devices detected and we could use this to better approximate the location of the devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we were able to track distances between the MAC addresses and the microcontrollers, we would have accurately triangulated the positions of each device, and plotted said positions into a map.
                    </li>
                </ol>
