                    Regarding one of the most popular industries of our time, one major issue that has risen is the difficulty of choosing the perfect location at the perfect time, for the perfect shot. According to a survey we conducted, everyone took over 30 minutes to decide on a location for a photo soot while 10 out of 11 people said they would share heir photo shoot locations with the public. Through this data we can conclude that a lot of time is wasted by photographers to find heir perfect location. We offer a service that provides convenience for these photographers. We created a network where photographers could help each other out, sharing and reviewing hot places for shots. Our app include a fast reviewing system that will take 2 minutes or less or your time to complete as well as the ability to save your favorite locations to stay up to date. We also offer location searching, hot locations, as well providing users with personalized search results based on their taste and location.
