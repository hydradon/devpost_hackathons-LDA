                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want people to accept the childlike imagination blooming inside each of their hearts. One of the best ways we do this is by painting! So we want to make that process easier for people by mixing the colors for them automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user simply inputs their desired color and Paint Floyd mixes the color from five basic colors, CMYKW.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed and built an 80-20 frame, a, automatic, cylindrical dispensing system using syringes and linear rod actuation, and controlled our device using motors and a photosensor for color feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to make any color given standard RGB, RYB, and CMYK color mehcanismsDriving stepper motors! Smooth linear actuation without bearings!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a beautiful compact design and finally getting the stepper motors to work for a final working product!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stepper motor driving should be locked down and done before anything else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Paint Floyd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling lots of data to make RYB color creation possible based on from an ML algorithm.
