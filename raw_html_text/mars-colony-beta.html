                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like playing puzzle games and I like reading science fiction. So I combined both of the things into an interactive science fiction story with a lot of puzzles in it. Using voice as user interface is a challenging situation and I want to master the VUX. I think we will have even more voice controll in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Alexa Skill Flow Builder Engine and wrote the code and story using VS-Code. The program is hosted on AWS Lambda and utilizes DynamoDB for persistence. Sourcecode and story text is managed with git version controll and is deployed using a CI/CD Pipeline on bitbucket.org
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Skill Flow Builder is still in development and it is not a full featured system yet. During the time of the project there were two releases of the engine and I needed to update my CI system.
Polly Voices sometimes pronounce words strangely. This was fixed by writing a plugin for Alexa-SFB now only some words are still pronounced strangely.
AWS was new to me and I had to learn a lot about serverless systems.
I never did video editing but I managed to make a 5 minute video for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnd how to build and automatically deploy cloud applications on AWS.
Duing writting of the story I significantly improved typing speed using 10-finger system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned JavaScript for node.js
I learned Bitbucket Pipelines / Docker container

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story still needs some more chapters to be written out. And maybe a translation into english.
