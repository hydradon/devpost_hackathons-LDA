                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do a RNN to originally generate reddit posts, but hearing about access to the icims api I wanted to instead use it for something that was applicable to that api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a recurrent neural network to do a character by character prediction and generate a job posting, and using the icims api would be able to push the Job Post to the database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a self built webscraper to grab sample job posts from indeed.com and converted it into jsons. I then used tensorflow and keras to preprocess and build the recurrent neural network. Finally I used flask to build a sample front end that allows users to easily generate and post the job listing onto the icims database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I did not have access to a GPU I was unable to test frequently, and I was unable to make a recurrent neural network that had a very low loss score. However, despite that the loss score was less than .1 and still managed to output decent results. Also I had a very small dataset, and because of this I wasnt able to learn more complex relations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the biggest accomplishment was that I had done this all by myself and was able to get a decently working neural network up and running
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use recurrent neural networks for text generation, and setting up a neural network to work on a backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for jobListing-generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are definitely some hyperparameters that could be tuned with the recurrent neural network, and I would also like to turn it from a basic recurrent neural network into a LSTM neural network. Finally I also would like to train the neural network on a large dataset since the dataset i trained on was very small
