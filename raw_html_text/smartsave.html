                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the fast moving world, new University/College students rarely have time to manage their finances wisely.
Due to lack of advice, and being busy at School, a lot of these students fall prey to massive debts.
We present to you StudentSave, the all in one app specially designed for Students.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses Machine Learning and advanced algorithms to:
1) Analyze spending habits and provide reminders when Payments are due.
2) Analyze previous impulse purchases and warns users when a new one is about to be made.
3) Notify users immediately when Fraud is detected.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We built the application on React-native so that it could be deployed on both Android as well as iOS devices.
2) The back-end of the application is built using Python, and hosted using Flask with a custom database solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We had challenges with linking the front-end with the back-end of the project, eventually leading us to develop our own database solution. 
2) Everyone on the team had to learn a variety of technologies from scratch, including react-native the Google Cloud API.
