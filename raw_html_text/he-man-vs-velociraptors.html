                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to make a game for Hack The 90's hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of challenges. 
First time using Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we made a somewhat broken but working game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a very basic game from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for He-Man vs Velociraptors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe we'll release a demo if it receives good feedback.
