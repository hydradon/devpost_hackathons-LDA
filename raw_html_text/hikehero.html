                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been hiking with my family since I have been young. A few of my family members take hiking very seriously, scaling the peaks of mountains. However, this can be very dangerous if a fall occurs while climbing the mountain, so this app aims to minimize the risks of hiking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When this app is activated, it will constantly monitor the acceleration of the phone in the X, Y, &amp; Z directions. If the hiker happens to fall while hiking, the acceleration of the phone in at least one of the directions will passes a certain threshold, depending on the phone's orientation. Once this occurs, the phone will automatically send a text message to the local police, informing them of the user's location and what has happened to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android-Studio, and utilizing a phone's accelerometer, location tracking, and SMS library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenges included getting the phone's location tracking working with the app. Additionally, we are both novices at coding and needed to learn about the functions of Android-Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have not used Android-Studio before today, and implemented much of what we learned in the early part of the competition into our final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated, neither one of us have used Android-Studio before. We had a small amount of experience in Java entering HackBCAIII, but none with XML, which we learned how to use today.
                </p>

                    What's next for HikeHero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to launch this app on the Google Play Store, and eventually create an IOS version of the app as well.
