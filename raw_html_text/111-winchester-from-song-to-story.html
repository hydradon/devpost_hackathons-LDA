                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our favorite bands, I The Mighty, has a gorgeously-written song with extremely visual lyrics. We were inspired by this song and the story it so eloquently told, so we decided to transform the song into an interactive storytelling game, much in the choose-your-own-adventure style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game transforms the experience of traditional storytelling into a more interactive, immersive, and intense experience for the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was built using the language Ink, which is somewhat of hybrid language between a markup and a scripting language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was deciding how we were going to convey this story, as well as finding a language and platform in which it would truly thrive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to not only have produced a full story and working - albeit short - game, but also that we had time to include a piece of original artwork to accompany the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By deciding to use Ink, we not only learned an entirely new language, but we also had the new experience of creating a full, playable game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 111 Winchester: From Song to Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although there likely won't be any updates for this game, we're excited to continue our game design journey as we will be creating more and more complex games in the future, perhaps even with more installments of "From Song to Story".
