                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have a car, and have to use the buses to get around.  I got annoyed with looking up the pdfs of timetables and reading them, so I thought this would be something fun to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You select a bus stop, then it populates with the buses that run though said stop, and then it will tell you the times that the bus stops there
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Class abstraction in JS and the error logs aren't easily accessable

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the tables and lookup functions working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of JS syntax
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd like to finish it, maybe even publish (with approval)
