                    Valiente means brave in spanish because it is giving employees a chance to show their bravery by standing up for themselves without any consequences. More than half of people who go through sexual abuse in the workplace are too embarrassed or scared to speak up. Valiente can provide a feeling of security and strength to these victims.

                    Many people who have gone through sexual assault in the workplace change jobs but must live with their trauma. If 25,720 rapes and sexual assaults happen every year in the workplace then how many of those people do you think feel fear free of going back to work in an office or building? Employers can give these employees a feeling of security in working with them. This is why Valiente allows companies to make their own profiles where they can be notified when their company&rsquo;s name is being used on the app. This gives them the chance to make a change not only in their company but in the rape culture that is based around areas of work.

                <p>
                    Xcode uninstalled in one of our computers so downloading again took 4 hrs and it deleted all of our front end.
Firebase was very hard to work with, and nearly no mentors really had any experience with it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    It was my (Kyara's) first Hackathon and this was my first time using Swift. I (Valeria) had used swift once before so it was pretty much teaching ourselves as we went a long. :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift + Firebase Integration. 
And that even when it seems like you won't finish, to not give up. 
We also learned to work as a team in this setting (we are sisters).

                    To build it out and have the data stored in the database brought into the app as a live feed. A way to make money from the app (either to keep or to donate to organizations that help the audience of the app) would be to charge a fee from companies and organizations who want to have their own sites in the app in order to show their commitment to making change occur as well as taking care of their employees. Also it would be great to add resources based on location of the person using the app.
