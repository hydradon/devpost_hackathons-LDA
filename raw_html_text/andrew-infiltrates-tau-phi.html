                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend Andrew, and the tower that we live in at Cal Poly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Andrew must yeet his signature pink camo crocs at his obstacles and reach the third floor before quiet hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of Googling about C# and Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We formerly had not worked with C# and Unity extensively, and had to spend a lot of time familiarizing ourselves with the structure/syntax of C# and the built-in mechanics of Unity
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yeeting crocs, making memes, and supporting dogs everywhere
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C# and Unity
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more levels and upping the complexity of the gameplay
