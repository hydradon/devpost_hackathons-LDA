                    Inspiration - We talked to people on the street and visited small businesses in Brooklyn and asked them: What are the biggest problems that Brooklyn has? Their answer: Traffic, pollution, and large corporations pressuring small businesses to shut down.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Green Route Brooklyn drives economic growth, reduces pollution and fossil fuels, and incentivizes people to use alternative modes of transportation in Brooklyn. Users receive points for using the subway, train, bikes, and buses and even walking! These points can be used to redeem vouchers, discounts, and deals at local businesses thus increasing local businesses' customer base. These deals and discounts are also partially subsidized by the city and municipal governments.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We plan to build this using Iphone's SDK as well as Google Maps API. We're also using key functionalities of the built-in M7 chips in Iphones to track users and their mode of travel.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - We're currently pitching in LIU Brooklyn's BE.IN Hack Brooklyn Innovation Challenge! Stay tuned for more updates!
