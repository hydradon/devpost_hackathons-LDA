                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this webapp from some alarming statistics about youth voter ship. Only 51% of eligible millennial voters cast a vote in recent elections. However, a large amount of millennials use Twitter. The easiest way for one to get in touch with their local representatives who they may not even know about otherwise, is to use Twitter to send a message to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project asks the user for input of their address, finds their local representative, and then asks for the username and password of the user. It logins to their twitter, and tweets the message the user wanted to write.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built with the Phone2Action API, which helped find the representative data. It then used Tweepy to tweet at the representatives, and Flask for the overall webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built without knowing much about working with JSON files, and setting up a Flask app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an app in a short amount of time while learning new things about JSON files and tweepy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are entering the best web app category.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are entering this category because our app accomplishes a lot in a simple manner. This app is genuinely usable by many people who may want to tweet at their local representatives, but have no clue who they are.
