                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adolescents in our respective towns/cities died due to the opioid epidemic and we thought the best prevention platform for 12-18 year olds is to have them play a game because 12-18 year olds enjoy playing games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prevention platform teaches adolescents that the consumption of excessive opioids will slow cognitive skills (the mouse) which can ultimately kill you, through symbolism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Java. The website was built using HTML along with in line CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only knew one programming language (Java) that fit this scenario, but the applets are no longer supported.
We also had trouble with the DNS for our original website on Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a fully functioning web application game to achieve the objective of our project. The website looks minamilist which was our goal as with current trends. We also were successful at our very first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from other groups and individuals in regards to scripting, debugging and permissions. Throughout the competition we sought the help of veteran teams for debugging of our applications. Through debugging we learned best practice methods of programming and learned some tips and tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Opium Rush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look to convert the game from a web application to a mobile application. While doing this, we seek adding certain features that we did not have enough time to develop during the hackathon.
