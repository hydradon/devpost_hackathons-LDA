                    Have you ever stuck in the dilemma of reading paper book or reading PDF? When some people read book, they prefer to use paper book instead of PDF or any other digit text. However, they still want to mark on the book freely and look up words instantly. Therefore, we intend to help users have a better experience of reading paper book but also realizing the methods that digital text editor can provide. Thanks to our

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We split our group into two parts: front-end and back-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Front-end group spent several hours on building up the Hololens developer environment on Windows,and then followed the instructions on Microsoft official website t o create some demos to test basic commands such as voice control, AR mode, cursor recaster, zoom-in/zoom-out, etc. After that, we used  Unity, vuforia and C# to realize the function we planned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Back-end group is responsible for data transfer and image processing with Python. With open CV library, the word that is nearest to the fingertip is detected and the meaning of this word will be sent to the client. We implemented the data transfer on the server side with Python Flask framework.

                    <li>
                        For front-end group, there are limited resources online about hololens development and the only thing we have is the official docs within several pages. We researched almost all the information we need. We also run into several errors when setting up the environment, and then we have trouble focusing on the book by using cursor, which left us desperate and wanted to quit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For back-end group, since there are so many words in one page of a book, it is difficult for us to accurately locate the word that pointed to by the user.

                            Develop with limited online resource. We have no access to example code for reference so we try API by ourselves. It is meaningful for us to develop in new fields.

                            Overcome problems from different perspectives. At the beginning we found the device was unable to focus on objects that are close but the focus point was a key part to implement our application. We once thought of giving up. We finally solved this problem using computer vision technology that detects the finger position and gets the nearby word.
