                    Supplies the user with lots of necessary information about whales

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and used a little css to make it look nice, and javascript to change out the facts, images, and pages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an animation along the bottom of the page, it took multiple members and mentors to get the animation working correctly.

                <p>
                    It all actually works and we got more done that I was expecting to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a very basic website isn't that hard. There are many ways to do everything and using more basic languages requires more brute force versus a more complex language having a more elegant way to do things
                </p>
