                <h2>
                    Current Scenario
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our research phase, from our own experience and of other people in India over the internet, we figured out three areas of improvement the in-flight experience of the passengers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lack of human interaction (for extroverts): People are not able to find any common interest among the persons sitting next to them, ending up spending time into electronic devices.
Lack of entertainment resources: For those who don&rsquo;t really prefer to get involved in talks, there is lack of resources especially if you&rsquo;re a Economy class passenger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although, some people prefer to sleep during the flights, but usually the quality of sleep is very poor at such situations and you may end up feeling more tired and uncomfortable. Because sometimes, you might have to wake up for food, or sometimes the passenger next to you needs to move, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we've built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to solve the above problem of In-Flight experience in two stages,
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Pre-flying stage:
                    </strong>
                    We came up with a mechanism to pair you up with the travellers matching your interests using the linguistic analysis of your social media footprints to infer the personality characteristics of users. Seating with co-passengers with similar interests can improve the overall flight experience to a great extent just naturally
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        During flight stage:
                    </strong>
                    Also, in case passenger is not in mood of interacting, we came up with a cost effective solution of providing in flight entertainment and services to the users to keep them engaged. This includes -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Real time movies/ tv series/ songs streaming/ magazines, games, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chat rooms (create your own, crew service on the fly)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Further, to monitor customer response, a real-time monitoring system analyses and records all the tweets with hashtags related to vistara (e.g. #vistara). We monitor the mood, sentiment of a tweet, its location, etc. and determine at what place in the world is the air service not upto the mark and where the service is doing really well. Accordingly, steps can be taken by the airline authorities.
                </p>

                    Benefits
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cost effective - no wiring, no in-place screens. Raspberry pi based server is a lot cheaper to implement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scope for preferential services/content in in-flight entertainment system adapted to passenger profiles.
