                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put on the Oculus Rift and you are immersed in an epic experience known as virtual engineering graphic and design. You will have the ability to share all of your wonderful work in one file so that people you send it to can work with it. Like a high powered, virtual 3D google docs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using unity, amazing C# skills, and the wonderful MLH hardware desk. You too can make it if you own 2 myo's, an oculus rift and a high powered laptop. (we are working on lowering that already low cost)
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sleep. it's a mission to sleep. we basically learned unity and C# in like 2 days. Our biggest challenge though actually was unrelated to this project. Our initial idea was to use the muse and try and develop an android app that interacts with it. We had many problems tho.
