                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, many of us find ourselves hundreds of miles away from our pets from the first time.

                    With Pet Connect, remotely video chat with your pet while using a remote to control a robot that lets you physically interact with your pet in real-time.

                <p>
                    As a reach goal, we'd like to add more functionality to our robot, such as arms for feeding treats or playing fetch, as well as a further range for the controls.
