                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to try different instruments, but always had a tough time getting the equipment or being judged for not knowing how to play. Therefore, I decided to design an app where you can play a few classic instruments on the go and with the comfort of your own room.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS app that gives you the option to play the xylophone, piano, and triangle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift and Xcode to develop the project. I used Apple's Music API AVFoundation to play the different instrumental sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to expand on this application by adding recording and messaging implementation through Firebase. I had a tough time managing multiple APIs and rendering the sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have successfully implemented Apple's API within the project. I was running into several dozen problems throughout the 24 hours, so I am glad I got the AudioVisual play function to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about APIs and Swift. I learned Swift a few days ago and started implementing APIs on the go. I learned a lot about how to use Firebase and will work on implementing it in future apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Play Music
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play Music will definitely have more features! I plan to add Firebase to the application so users can share their musical talents with one another.
