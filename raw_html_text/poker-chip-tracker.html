                    Inspiration: Vincent and his friends were into playing poker, but didn't have actual chips so had to use calculators in order to play -&gt; wanted a program to keep track of chips
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Lets the program keep track of all of the chips in play and automatically does functions such as checking, betting, calling, raising, and folding
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Brainstormed each function's jobs and broke down the whole game-playing process into different components
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Frequent errors that the program gave out because we never checked the type of the variable that we were receiving from the user
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Actually get something working that could be somewhat useful
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Planning ahead and discussing with a partner is KEY to making something very complicated working (especially considering all of the different possible outcomes of the user's inputs)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Poker Chip Tracker: A user-friendly GUI that helps visualize the actual chips that each person has in possession
