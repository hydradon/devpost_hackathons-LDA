                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working in the lab late one night,
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight.....
                </p>
                <p>
                    A prescription bottle with a barcode. Hey, we can use this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps doctors and patients manage their use of prescription medication. Doctors or pharmacies will generate a QR code for their patients' drugs, and the patients can scan that QR code to track their intake. The system will alert an emergency contact if a patient tries to take a medicine that is not their own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, SQL, Swift

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None. We never miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble maintaining our connection between the app and our Apache server and scanning QR codes.
