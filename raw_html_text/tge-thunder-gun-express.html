                    PostMan is used to test an API that we created in the back-end by spinning up containers for the development team to simulate AJAX calls. Docker was used to ensure reproducibility across back-end developers, by spinning up a virtual environment for consistent testing and deplpyment. Furthermore the usage of Docker enables theoretically unlimited scalability via Kubernetes. The entire project, including  the MySQL and Adminer database back-end tools are hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to leverage Google's extensive Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Storage as a Service (Saa) capabilities. GCP hosts the repository for the back-end since GitHub is only used for version control.

                    The Instagram API is a terrible awful monolithic roadblock to human civilization and progress. We learned how to graph polygonal geographic data and working with GEOJSON. We learned about how to protoype UX frameworks for mobile app development. We learned about testing frameworks for back-end development (PostMan, Adminer). We learned about integrating Docker containers with Kubernetes to improve scalability in later app versions.
