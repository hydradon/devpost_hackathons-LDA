                    In an emergency room, trauma surgeons/Emergency Doc&rsquo;s are under pressure to evaluate patient as quickly as possible. In cases where more detail review is needed they order a CT scan which is acquired in a different room. Often to review the images they leave the patient to go to the imaging room, this is time consuming and potentially dangerous as they are away from.
