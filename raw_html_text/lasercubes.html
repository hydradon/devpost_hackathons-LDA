                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world needed a new way to interact online
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Move around in front of your camera and explore CUBE WORLD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a face tracking library and three.js to make a 3d virtual world you can play in with your friends
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The camera library was poorly documented so we had to hack it up to get something working quickly.
The networking needed to make live online games is tricky, we're doing it for the first time. None of us have programmed in golang before so the decision to use it was a folly, but it worked out well in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It really works. It works on a cell phone, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use three.js to make cool 3d games, how to do client-server interactions, and a quick dive into golang for servers.
                </p>

                    What's next for LaserCubes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Replace AJAX with WebSockets so it's faster.
