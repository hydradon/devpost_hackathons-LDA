                    When you are out on the internet, there are stuff that you don't necessarily want your parents, especially your mom to see...

                    Ideally, this website is going to be having feeds of random stuff that are not parents-appropriate.
But right now, it's just a random website that is rather appropriate for all-ages.

                    I started with registering the domain name from domain.com, then i started to work on the webpage. I coded the html and css at first. Then I ran into the problem of animating the count-down effect on the 2nd page. So I asked for help on the mentor channel of Slack. Lauren Raddatz came over and helped a lot. After trials and errors of changing codes, switching css to scss and switching it back, We figured out achieving the desired result by modifying a code snippet of javascript online. So the whole webpage is then completed and ready to be published to the web. Then it came to the challenge of finding a web host for my site. I approached mentors on slack, got lots of great suggestions but at last decided to just use another github page to host the domain. Then it's the problem of figuring out how to link my githubpage

                    . I had to refer back to another website that I have, which is another domain purchsed from google domain but also hosted through github. The procedure was a bit confusing for the domain.com domain, because there are more than 15 of additional DNS records whose functions that I don't know of. I had to try out adding different methods of adding type A DNS records and even change out its nameservers on domain.com's end. Besides, I had to go back to github to adjust the codes: to rename the 1st page to be index.html, going into all the codes to fix the link to the images, since they are not at the same designated folder as what's been saved on my computer. After the tiny changes were made. It is now working properly on the designated [

                    Keep trying, keep googling, ask for help.
It's always GOOD to fail, because you'll then fix the error and the final product more polished and less breakable.
If the code doesn't work, but you think they should. Give it some moment and let the magic of codes do its thing. After... let's say 30min, hit refresh the page, and BOOM, maybe it'll be working now!

                    It will be fun to keep working on it and actually turn it into a fun website with lots of feeds coming in, either generated by the users or crawled from the website or handselected. There should a mechanism to filter out the contents that are "appropriate".
