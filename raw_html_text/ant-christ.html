                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone wrote "Obama is the Antchrist" on the back of their windshield then someone from the internet saw that misspelling and created an image of it literally. We took Ant Christ and made a game of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Four buttons are used to enter player choices into the game. Users are prompted which buttons to select. Players enter how many people are playing the game. Next, LCD screen prompts players to look at the
screen making sure that no one else is looking. Screen informs player their role in the game, ant or ant-christ. Ant-christ's role is to thwart the efforts of the ants to destroy the colony, but their identity must remain
a secret. The role of queen is assigned to players in sequential order. LCD prompts queen to select advisors to make decisions for the colony. The number of advisors is 2/3 the number of people playing (rounding down). 
An event befalls the colony once at each turn. Events are classified as good or bad. A good event brings the possibility to increase the number of ants in the colony. A bad event brings the possibility of 
decreasing the number of ants in the colony. The LCD prompts the advisors to come to the screen individually. The advisor is asked if they want the good/bad event to pass/fail. After that advisor is done making decisions,
if their are more advisors, they will be prompted by the LCD screen to come to the screen and enter their decision. Decisions should be made in private. After decisions are made, a mini game occurs. 
The queen must play the mini game. LED's light up sequentially at a speed that is determined by the advisor's decision of pass or fail. If most of the advisors wanted the good event to fail, or a bad event to pass, the sequential
 speed of the LEDs is higher, so that it's harder to hit the red LED. If most of the advisors wanted the good event to pass, or the bad event to fail, the sequential speed is slower, making it easier to hit the red LED.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each colored LED carries a probability of loss or gain. Blue LEDs lose 75% of the population in a bad event or gain no ants in a good event. Green LEDs lose 50% of the population in a bad event and give a 25% population 
increase in a good event. Yellow LEDs lose 25%  of the population in a bad event and increase the population by 75% in a good event. Lastly, the red LED ensures no ants are lost in a bad event and your ant colony is 
doubled in a good event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the mini game, the remaining amount of ants is displayed on the LCD screen and the next player can be queen, but, if the ant population reaches 0, the game is automatically won by the ant-christs.
                    <br>
                    After everyone has been queen a winning side is determined. Any remaining ants is determined to be a win for the ants.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino and various accessories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a delay from the button press and preventing noise. We also ran into an issue of using delays for our LED mini game, because the delay would interrupt the arduino from reading any other input. We fixed the delay for button press by creating a debounce function, and we fixed the led delay interruption, by using the current millisecond time instead of the delay function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to work out bugs to create a playable product for the exposition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The delay function in arduino is an interrupt. You have to use debounce when pausing input and preventing noise from button input.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3D printed housing, and specific events.
