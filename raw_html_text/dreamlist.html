                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of getting another pair of socks for the holidays, we wanted to be able to direct the goodwill of friends and family to things we finds more meaningful. DreamList is created to aggregate your future purchases, charity contributions, project fundraising, registries, savings accounts and any other expenses you expect in one place - so anyone who wants to help you can do so easily and meaningfully. Now, instead of Toys'R'Us we can direct friends who want to send gifts for our children to a savings fund that distributes contributions across a selection of tech stocks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dreamlist provides an environment of social encouragement for people to save for big expenses - such as college, cars, vacations, or homes, or other things they find meaningful.  It also shows what people give to charities and the needy.  Ultimately every user has a profile of the things he or she is saving up for.  Users largely contribute to their goals individually, but others are encouraged to help when it makes sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Postgres, Heroku, Stripe, .CLUB . We want to aggregate a financial savings tool and registry/merchandising inventory from each user's registries as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heroku, our main host, was down for more than 5 hours out of the 20 hour hackathon. Fortunately, we deployed early, but it is still down as of this submission. Please, let us show you our local version for judging, if needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DreamList has a lot of monetisation opportunities - from referral bonuses, to shares of transactions, to positive cash-flow, to vendor promotion opportunities, and other revenue channels. In less than 20 hours we were able to create a basic prototype, demo to friends and family and receive confirmation that there is demand for such a product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DreamList
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a fully functional prototype.
