                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want something fun - interactive and surprising, and something we can share with other people.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peaceful Farm is an augmented reality photo filter with a twist. Users can plant fun objects in the environment and take creative photos which they can save to their phones. It is a webapp, so no app downloads are necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 8th wall, html and modified documented code to implement Peaceful Farm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are completely new to AR and faced difficulty in animation, learning the syntax and integrating the parts in a very short time. A lot of things were done through trial and error, and exploration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about AR, honed our programming skills and built something fun that we can share with our friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to learn effectively, and how to be creative
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the farm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding in animations into the 3d objects and enabling users to throw the object in 3D space. Manipulation of objects. More interactive features.
