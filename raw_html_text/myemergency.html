                    Being college students, we've witnessed first-hand what an overconsumption of alcohol can result in. Every year 1 out of every 10,000 college students die from alcohol abuse. In addition, other health issues such as cardiac arrest kills more than 2/3 of its victims. In order to increase the odds of survival, it's important for the public to be educated on how to handle these situations as they occur.
