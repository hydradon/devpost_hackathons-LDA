                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heavy brainstorming of ideas in the hours before bitcamp started with a little help from a dev's girlfriend

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows customers to see the progression of edits of their photos from special events by their photographers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website front end using the Bootstrap CSS framework, to give a clean responsive design. The backend is powered by PHP, using object-orientated programming to organize data and cURL requests to access the IBM Watson API. We also used JavaScript for form submissions, live updates, and image uploads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing the comments section with the IBM Watson Tone Analysis API was difficult because none of us had dealt with a machine learning API in the past. Another challenge was uploading batches of images to albums using Amazon Web Services. Our largest issue however was learning new programming languages and techniques, especially for those of us who had no prior web development experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of finishing our website with time to spare in the competition. We are also proud that we got all of our ideas out into the website and that we may have made an interface for photographers and other service providers to make the feedback and collaboration process easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different functions of programming languages such as file uploading in JavaScript and cURL HTTP requests in PHP. We also learned that the most important part of a group project is coordination and being able to smoothly construct the pieces into the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pheedback
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up next for Pheedback would be broadening the user range, from just photographers to other artists and machinists, so all clients could experience the easy and practical system we have created.
