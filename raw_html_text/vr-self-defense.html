                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are countless reports of people being sexually and physically assaulted everyday. This application hopes to reduce the number of those occurrences by offering a self-defense virtual reality class to the public for free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR Self-Defense provides a dummy for the user to practice a set of four moves on, only passing them if they hit all of the spheres correctly and quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project in Unity &amp; C#, utilizing the Oculus &amp; its Touch Controllers. To share code effectively, we used Unity Teams to push and pull our changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge was figuring out how to keep track of which sphere the user had to correctly select next. This was done by creating an array for the GameObject spheres and manually inputting them in order. Then a try-catch block was executed to see if the current index in the array was null (a.k.a the object was deleted). If the wrong object was deleted then the level would end. Another difficulty was trying to record the movements of the Oculus Touch and storing them into an external file, in hopes of dynamically spawning spheres to help execute quick moves. Sadly, the process was too complicated to carry out during the short period of the hackathon, but we were able to successfully implement the four levels with complex and informative moves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement rag-doll physics which was certainly difficult, and were able to correctly determine which sphere needed to be collided with next. Although there were some slow patches in the period of our development, we were able to use our joint knowledge in order to help each other overcome coding and implementation difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively user the Oculus and its Touch controllers, even taking advantage of its haptics. Ray-casting, object detection, game flow, rag-doll physics, and much more useful mechanics were able to be implemented due to our dedicated team. We also educated ourselves on some self-defense moves that we hope to teach others in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Self-Defense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement more levels and moves so that users can be even more prepared for an abundance of different situations. We hope to record the Oculus Touch movements and dynamically produce spheres to act as a way-point for more complicated moves.
