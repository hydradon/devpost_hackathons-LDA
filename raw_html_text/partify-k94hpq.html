                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Queuing songs at a party is always a struggle, everyone wants something different and there&rsquo;s always someone who takes over the playlist. Therefor we built Partify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution: generate Spotify playlists automatically using machine learning based on the users favorite tracks sorted by mood select-able by the host.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We analyzed songs labelled by their playlists titles to determine what metadata parameters determines the mood and feel of a song, from calm (lounge) to intense (club). The tracks are classified with a Support Vector Machine with regularization in SciKit Learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built on react, following a Spotify-inspired light theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Backend is built using Python and Flask library. All the data is fetched using the Spotify API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was to determine what data to analyze and which model to use, since we wanted to determine lounge and club music feel based on Spotify's features-metadata. So far it has an accuracy of approximately 85-90 %, this can be improved using more training data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot about how Spotify API&rsquo;s work and also gained some new machine learning skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Partify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming better at classifying tracks and adding more variety of moods to pick from, we had an idea of a triangle/octagon picker instead of a simple slider. Another improvement would be shuffling the users different tracks in a smarter way so they get similar representation in the playlist.
