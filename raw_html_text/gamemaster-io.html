                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When friends hang out together, or just want to play games but lack players, since it is hard to bring cards, especially large board games. We want to create a web page, where you can find those games and play with other players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides the functionality to create (chat-) rooms with friends and launch party games moderated by the server.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                    Entirely built on Django.
