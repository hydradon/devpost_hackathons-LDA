                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to make a semi-spooky game in unity while not knowing anything. It was a little ambitious I admit, but I now have what some would call paralyzing fear I call respect. We really wanted to demo something for the hack-a-thon though, but our semi-spooky game was nowhere near anything worth presenting. So, my teammate Victoria suggested using Love, which she heard off once before. This was halfway through the weekend so we both knew we did not have a lot of time. So we both entered the abyss again hopefully something to show for it by 9 am Sunday. The games are the stuff that we learn while playing around and understanding the language. The last game is not really a game but more of proof of concept.

                <p>
                    Trying to get the game to execute, the process to create the .love file to run the game is oddly specific.
