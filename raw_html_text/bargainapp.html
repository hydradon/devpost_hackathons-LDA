                    Bargain App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up around a culture of bargaining and haggling (in India and Jamaica) and I saw that it was an inefficient system. Non-locals often had to pay much more, and people who had less time to bargain or were less experienced hagglers also paid more than what the item is really worth. It was also bad for vendors as well as they were often selling at inconsistent and inefficient prices (rather than at the market equilibrium price which would bring maximum profit) and their scope for expansion or scaling was limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is a proof of concept. It consists of a search feature that allows users to search for an item and its details as well as an add item feature that lets users add an item (and its price and vendor) that they just bought to the public database. If I want to buy an apple, I see that it has been selling at a dollar, so I will know that the vendor is still manipulating me If (s)he offers to sell it for $3 and lets me bargain down to $2. If this app becomes popular and widely used, it will automatically remove the need for bargaining/haggling as prices of all items in the surrounding area is public knowledge. Over time, prices will become constant for all buyers and will change according to the market equilibrium, which is fair to both the customer and vendor.

                    This was my teammate's and my first hackathon and we are both new to progamming and hacking so it was a challenge for us to get done what we wanted to in such a short period of time. I spent more time learning about angular.js and ionic framework than actually working on the idea. But we managed to make a functional app that shows off our idea, but couldn't implement a database and other features that we wanted to such as a 'take a picture' option, geo-tagging, and a rating system within time. However I am still happy that we managed to make an app and we will continue working on this till it becomes a polished app.
