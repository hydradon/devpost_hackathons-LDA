                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by all the children attending earth day.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game depicts a nasty character throwing his trash on the ground.  The more trash he throws that touches the ground, the more the disastrous the world gets. #Apocalypse It is up to the player to save the world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first looked at all of the potential hard parts of the code and created algorithms for them.  Then, we executed them in Android Studio.  For the graphics, we used Piskel to created our pixelated environment and objects.  Lastly, we used the Ableton Live to create the three different levels of music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off in Unity on a physics based 2D platform, but had problems implementing touch controls for the user and randomizing the parabola and angle of each trash thrown. After one day, we moved to Android Studio and created our app there.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the physics behind our game, how easily the game flows, our graphics, and the custom music that goes with our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our members did not know either Unity, Android Studio, how to create graphics, and overall, game development.  We are proud today that now all of our members are comfortable and have experienced all four.

                <p>
                    We would love to keep expanding on this game while also creating other Earth Day themed mini games!
