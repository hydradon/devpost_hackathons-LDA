                    Has it ever happened that you were watching Netflix or YouTube and you come across an actor or famous person who you don't recognize? And you had to go through the entire cast list and then google everyone's pictures to see if you got the right one (Many times there isn't a cast list)? And then probably go to their Wikipedia page and learn more about them? NOT ANYMORE!!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CelebFinder easily spots and recoginzes the celebrities on your webpage just by facial recognition. It even pulls up an introduction about the person.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using angular, CelebFinder takes a screenshot of the user's webpage. The image is then processed and using the Microsoft Computer Vision API, recognizes all the celebrities. Chrome Extension Browser Action then shows more information of all the famous people including more pictures, a brief introduction, and links to their profiles on Wikipedia.
