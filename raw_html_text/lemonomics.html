                    Today there are people of all backgrounds and all ages who are struggling with their finances or with understanding how to do basic accounting and budgeting. In order to combat this, our team decided to teach the youth basic accounting skills in a fun way to supplement a project they're already engaged in - selling lemonade at lemonade stands. Lemonomics supplements the current Lemonade Stand style entrepreneurship scheme by getting the user to input and interpret their costs, potential profits and losses, pricing, total revenue, and how to further invest their profits.

                    We chose to stick to large texts, simple language, and colorful, cartoonish graphics in order to keep the attention of our 7-9 year old audience and simultaneously engage and educate them. Our easy-to-use website is designed to be usable across platforms so that there is a lower barrier of access. Lemonomics was built in javascript, css, and html.
