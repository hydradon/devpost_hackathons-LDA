                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to do a Twilio project, but we could not figure that out, so we did a text adventure.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded it in java.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of if statements and we did not have much prior experience with this language so learning it was kinda hard.

                    We made it.
