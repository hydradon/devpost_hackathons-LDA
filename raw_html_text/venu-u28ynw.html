                        Ven&uuml; is designed to bridge the disconnect between music fans and artists when coordinating live shows
                    </strong>
                    Music artists suffer from logistical barriers -- either not selling enough tickets, losing revenue to management, or having difficulty gauging fan interest before booking shows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fans invite their favorite artists to perform at a specific venue through our platform. If the artist is interested in playing that event, they broadcast the plan to their fans as a pending event. The fans show interest by paying their ideal amount for the show, and this money is held in "escrow" until enough interest is generated to satisfy the artists' requested revenue for the event. If the money isn't raised in time, the fans who paid are reimbursed for their share.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Pricing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a reverse dutch auction model to coordinate the pricing for these events. The artist sets a minimum revenue, and this model coordinates a relationship between the minimum number of seats and price per seat that would satisfy this amount.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we were unable to test the validity of our code through the Truffle console once we migrated to the live Rinkeby testnet. We needed multiple accounts each filled with ether to test the relationship between the accounts on our platform, but even though our MetaMask accounts had ether and existed on the network we were unable to sign transactions using more than one account. After a lot of troubleshooting and interaction with people from MetaMask and Truffle, we figured out that it was a limitation of the Truffle platform itself. Unwilling to give up, we ended up hacking our local Truffle files to support interacting with multiple MetaMask accounts and were finally able to test our contract on a live testnet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ven&uuml;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to finish the frontend so that it isn't just a shell anymore. Users should be able to interact with our Solidity contract without having to type code into their command lines. Additionally, we want to implement endpoint verification and artist accountability so that a customized ERC20 token scanned at the venue will show us that the event actually occurred and the artist showed up. If this verification is not completed, all of the money in the contract will be sent back to fans rather than the artist relatively easily, because of the nature of an immutable blockchain.
