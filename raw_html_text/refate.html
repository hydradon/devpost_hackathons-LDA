                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we came to Hackathon we wanted to do some project that facilitates sustainable production practices for companies. But that also includes responsible consumption which means being mindful about what, how, and how much we produce and consume so that the earth's resources are used carefully and preserved for future generations. That led us to the producer site of this bottled water Voeslauer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to their site, each bottle is produced from 100% recycled material and the company does a great job but how many companies care about it too? How each of us could influence on producer companies so they will become more responsible for our planet?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a place where consumers and producers could submit information about products. The producers could register there and will be able to list their products. They will have generated QR code which could be printed on the product&rsquo;s tag. Each of us could scan the QR code and see the product lifecycle including where we can recycle it. The producers would do that to increase customer loyalty and differentiate from companies less aware and/or carrying of their ecological footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webapp using React with Material UI.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s very difficult to find reliable data on any product lifecycle, it&rsquo;s either does not exist or biased towards the producer of the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a way to  allow customers to get meaningful insights about the products they are using every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were surprised but the amount of trash generated by humans. The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of plastic and other solid waste a day, 10 times the amount a century ago, according to World Bank researchers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReFate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue the development of the project and going to add image recognition to simplify the product&rsquo;s input process.
