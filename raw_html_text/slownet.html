                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My phone's Internet connection was just too fast and that was boring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter a URL. The app will place a call to an application server running a Twilio call interpreter. Your request is sent through the call as DTMF tones and decoded by the server, which then fetches the content you requested. That data is then converted to a byte array, which the server uses to build an aural representation of your page, which is then played back through the phone and recorded/stored locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints, data is saved as a .wav on the phone. To view that data with your eyeballs, you can click "View". The SlowNet app uses a Fast Fourier Transform with a disturbingly high error tolerance to get your data back in the original web page format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally everything. Analog phone systems are hard. Sound processing is hard. Math is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SlowNet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original purpose was to keep a phone call open indefinitely so it could be used to maintain a persistent connection, with the app sending data off as it is requested by the system, similar to how a mobile data connection works. I think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dependencies: Automatic Call Recorder (Android), configured for automatic saving. Apparently my phone vendor blocked the easy method of recording calls, but ACR has a workaround figured out.
