                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sightclone is an idea that came to life when our team remembered the various natural disasters they've seen through the state of Texas.  Recall Hurricane Dolly, a category 1 hurricane that hit South Texas with its 99mph winds and heavy rains. We believe everyone should be ready to face any natural disaster and to know the storm relief they have access to, no matter the size of the storm.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sightclone takes in an input from the user in the form of a city/zip code and state and pulls up documentation of what storms hit that area along with their frequency, level of damage, and all resources both nationally and locally that the user can have access to in the case of an emergency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Sightclone in JavaFX with Scene Builder as we felt these programs can achieve the user friendly interface we were working to attain.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is obviously still a work in progress. Our biggest challenge was a way to pull information on a vast variety of regions and translate them to easily understandable plots and graphs.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no singular accomplishment we are proud of, instead, the whole learning process was an accomplishment itself. Although our application has its bugs and is missing a few parts, working on it drove us to get out of our comfort zone and explore all sorts of way we can achieve our goals. We will be walking away from this project with an even greater drive to experiment and write more projects outside of academics. And who knows? Maybe Sightcone can be a running working application in the future.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on Sightclone, we discovered the world of APIs and Web Crawlers. We had learned what they are and how one would implement them into their own code. Our idea seemed daunting at first, but learning about these techniques and strategies made us more confident in making our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sightclone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sightclone will continue to be a work in progress, as most of our projects will be. We will continue to improve and learn different methods of creating an application like this because we genuinely want to create something that has the chance of helping people. Sightclone's main mission is to make storm prepping less scary as the user will be well informed through our application.
