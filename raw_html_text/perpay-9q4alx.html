                <p>
                    Members of our hackathon team are from different states in the U.S.: Washington, Illinois, and Indiana. We came here to meet up and live together for four days. During the four days, we have a LOT of expenses - from paying for Airbnb to buying water and snacks. It's difficult and inconvenient to make all payments separately. And we found it troublesome to split our bills every single time when one person paid for the whole group. So we decided to calculate the
                    <strong>
                        net amount of money
                    </strong>
                    we owe to each other after the four days of the trip. What if there's an app that can help us keep track of our bills?
                </p>

                    A combination of OpenCV and google cloud vision are used to detect and recognize texts in the image. The image is first preprocessed using OpenCV to grayscale, polarize, resized, and stretched to improve the quality of the image for better recognition. Then we passed the processed image into the Google vision API.
