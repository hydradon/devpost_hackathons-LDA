                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is any app that sends daily notifications and provides useful new information based on the day almost like a catered message board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program is meant to give college students valuable information on financial literacy in little tidbits that they can read about daily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using expo and React-Native with Android studio to create and debug the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to learn React native in less than 24 and trying to figure out how much financial information was just enough without giving the user so much information that they are overwhelmed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working React Native app without a template, figuring out common bugs when working React-Native and how to fix them, having a mortgage risk calculator(not implement)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard work and dedication are cool. Also, react won't tell you when something is wrong it like nudges like maybe somethings wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fin U
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fin U is nowhere near a completed product, we expect it to implement the value of a mortgage calculator.
