                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today we were bit scared leaving our laptops behind while having food or going to bathroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a solution to our problem and credit goes to FemmelHacks !!! We build a Techie Guard , that attaches to your belonging and notifies you when it is being tempered with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Intel Edison Hardware and Grove Starter Kit along with Twilio API and node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with hardware so it took a while to learn it and execute it. We faced a lots of issues while synchronizing device with laptop but at last we got it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to properly execute the sensor and having a sms response immediately after that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to synchronize hardware device with laptop and execute respective API.
                </p>
