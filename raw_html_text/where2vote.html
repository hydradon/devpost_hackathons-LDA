                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, we were sitting like "hey, what we gonna code today? What's gonna get the people woke, not a video game cuz none of us know how to do that, and what is something we care about." Then, it came to us. If there was a way to look up the closest polling station that was not google, then that would be totally awesome and we could also include Obama.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ok this website just tells you where the closest polling station is and also has an epic video of Obama telling us to vote.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and google api. ;)
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    please we just want to submit ( this was us at 1:30 am trying to figure out devpost. This will remain here to forever commemorate our first hackathon attempt.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Getting a youtube video to work
-Building a basic website 
-THEN
-Google API, basically none of us knew how to use that API and it was really hard. Thank you to Nathan for helping us because he helped us connect the JS to JSON to HTML. I don't know how to explain it I'm so sorry I'm just so tired.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ok basically I'm so proud that we made something. We came to this hackathon because we all wanna do CS as majors and we're like "oh, what a fun friday night activity to do." Little did we know, that hackathons are actually serious and we are not. I'm so sorry to annoy we annoyed with our laughter, we just like to joke and we don't know how to code really. We made something and it doesn't look THAT bad so I'm very proud of myself and my team. We almost quit but we pulled through and I'm very excited to present TODAY!
