                    Our submission for the IThinkUPC challenge.

                    It's difficult for a new student to find friends and fun activities to do in a new city. It's also pretty difficult to get your NIE, and other legal documents you're going to need, so this inspired us to come up with a solution!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had several ideation phases. Then we designed the screens and made a functioning animated prototype that we're going to use for the demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced challenges along the way, it was the first time we're filming and editing a video, also animating some parts of the prototype were quite tricky, but we managed to finish it all in time while working on two other projects as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Check out our youtube video and our github page which contains the designs and the prototype!
