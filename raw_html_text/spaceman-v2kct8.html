                        I loved video games ever since a child and I believe people would want something as such for the Hackathon.

                        It starts the player off in a top-down arcade driven shooter with effects, music, and a score system!

                        By using the Unity game engine, music that I enjoyed, sound effects I created in FL Studio, Scripts I made in C#, and my perception as a gamer!

                        Mostly run-time errors that would make the entire Unity program crash. I didn't remember to save much so I would commonly lose five to ten minutes of work 2-3 times along the way. :(

                    <em>
                        The game has some optimization for memory space, as it deletes specific objects over time, The game's art is fantastic, This was made from scratch Unity with almost no game plan the day before, and the game runs smoothly.

                <p>
                    <em>
                        C is a useful programming language that made me consider how Java, the language I'm most familiar with, may still have some drawbacks in 2019 due to the virtual machine concept they implement rather than talking to the computer. Also that the life of a Software Developer isn't as crazy as I thought it was and I'm very comfortable coding for a 24 hour crunch time.
