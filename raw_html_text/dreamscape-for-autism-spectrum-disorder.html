                    Going to crowded public spaces is a highly stressful and yet unavoidable experience for families with children on the autism spectrum. Many individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder have high sensitivity to light and sound - a phone that keeps ringing in the distance or a slightly-too-brightly lit shopping display could trigger an uncontrollable autism meltdown that lasts for hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We present DreamScape - a low audio-visual stimulus virtual reality experience to help children with autism prevent or recover from autism meltdowns. Children can escape a busy world into a soothing moonlit realm where they are told to track shooting stars while listening to soft classical music. The application, when paired with a wearable like the Fitbit or Band, will adjust the level of stimulus based on the child's heart rate. With DreamScape, we aim to empower families and more importantly individuals with autism with the ability to regain control in overwhelming situations.
