                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a talk with the people of wakefern and JP Morgan and realized there are a lot of problems to which there are already solutions. But still we brainstormed a few ideas and had a concise idea list to show out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much. We created diff scenarios as to how we can try to implement a few of our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Docs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friction between the team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we could find common ground
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we all can find common ground. And not all of these ideas can be implemented without a right team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Healthy Ideas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the right push and resources, the implementations can reduce overhead of the company.
