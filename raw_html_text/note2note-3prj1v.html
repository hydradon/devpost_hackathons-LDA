                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Missed too many lectures before a test and wanted a better way to make up for lost time. Wanted a student-friendly app that allowed for convenient sharing of lecture notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to upload pictures of notes, taken by their mobile cameras. Pictures can be tagged with the specific class and are entered into an online database. Students can search and find notes easily for all their necessary classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Android Studio and Parse database to create our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transferring all data from local device database to online database available to all clients. Also struggled to understand some class APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bomb-ass logo (and the fact that we actually understood online databases).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make databases and improved our front-end development. Also strengthened our ability to think as a team and code as a unit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Note2Note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, additional features will be added and Note2Note will help students among various universities.
                </p>
