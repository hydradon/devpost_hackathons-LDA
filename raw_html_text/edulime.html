                    The Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers lack a proper teacher-to-teacher network that enables collaboration between those in different fields, schools, and teaching experience. Hawaii&rsquo;s education system has yet to attain an inclusive, high-quality education for all students. With the rapidly-changing workforce ahead of new generations, teachers must provide their students with the knowledge they need to thrive and build a sustainable future for Hawai&rsquo;i. Powerful teacher-to-teacher networks enable teachers in Hawaii to develop and utilize lesson plans that promote learner-oriented lifelong learning.
