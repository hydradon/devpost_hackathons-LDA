                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was drawn from being in an rigourous engineering program, and seeing others having issues but having no one to talk to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a chat bot that attempts to alleviate your anxiety, depression by allowing a channel in which you are able to communicate your thoughts and feelings.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using the Microsoft Bot Framework's Node.js SDK, intergrated LUIS NLP and CockroachDB. Angular was used for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hit some roadblocks trying to use our Python knowledge to write JavaScript. It also took awhile to receive our Azure credits to begin hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to integrate Cockroach DB and get the LUIS NLP working.
                </p>

                    Focus more on creating the Minimal Viable Product and worry about the details later.
