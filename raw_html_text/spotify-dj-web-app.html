                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love music and thought about the popularity of Spotify and how cool it would be to take some of its features and allow a group to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app gets the currently playing music and allows for a "collaborative skip" of songs. (Basically if 3 different people press skip, it skips.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using Node Js and React. I started with some Spotify API authentication server boilerplate. Then I broke down each step of the process that needed to be accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a ton of problems relating to the asynchronous nature of javascript. Sometimes code would execute before it had the information it needed to have that was returned from promises. Other than that probably the sensitivity of Spotify's Authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am so proud of myself for finishing this project and all basic features work. I am also happy that I was able to use a lot of background knowledge of React and Node to build it. I really feel a lot more confident as a developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the importance of time-blocking issues and completing a task by relevance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spotify DJ web app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to rewrite everything and pursue some-what of a finished product that I could put online and publicly release.
