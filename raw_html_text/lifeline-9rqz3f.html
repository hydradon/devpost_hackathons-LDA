                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have attended Western for the past 4 years, and have seen the growing effects of the opioid crisis on the citizens of this city. It is a major concern and very little services exist to mitigate or reduce the problem. We hope to bring forward a technical approach to tackling the issue, and as a community we can look out for each other and create a safer environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an emergency response mobile application where individuals who are heavily dependent on drugs, such as fentanyl, can receive the help they need in the event of experiencing a drug overdose. Our app immediately contacts 911, as well as any nearby registered responders who are carrying naloxone kits. Nearby responders will be able to attend to the victim quickly as they will arrive before the ambulances, which could give more time to transfer the victim to a hospital before reaching critical condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the app using Ionic and Angular for the frontend, and Node for the backend. We integrated Google Maps to help the responders quickly locate and intercept victims of overdose. When an anonymous user sends the distress signal, all registered responders within a close proximity are contacted VIA Twilio services with an alert and are provided with a location. Responders are also given valuable information provided from the London Data Portal to assist with anything they may need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with Angular and Ionic coming into the Hackathon, which definitely ate up a lot of the development time. We encountered many bugs and difficulties when trying to integrate Google Maps and set up the connection with our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had doubts about our scope for this weekend, and are super happy that we were able to put together a working project. We are also proud of creating a viable prototype that could have the potential of protecting many people from harms of drug abuse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to take breaks when feeling exhausted, and looked out for each other. We found that by doing so, it creates a more positive team attitude and leads to greater success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifeline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially thinking about using the phone's sensor capabilities and ML libraries to autonomously detect if someone is entering a state of overdose, or adding a group chat functionality to allow close responders to communicate with one another from within the app; however, given the time frame, we did not think it was feasible. It would be awesome to implement in the future, though!
