                    The Inspiration for our project was first around the Inequality and Globalization that affects kids in underdeveloped countries to get an education.

                    We plan to make a penpal system for grades 3-12 students that will pair with a kid similar ages so they can talk to them about what they learned in school offering the less fortunate kid's an outlet to education
