                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to drink 1-2L of water per day. But in our busy chaotic lives, we tend to neglect this fundamental need. What if someone could follow you and remind you to constantly to drink water until it becomes a habit? No one spends more time with you than your phone, hence this mobile app was born.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This mobile application allows you to set a task --the habit that you want to develop. You set a frequency at which you will be reminded to perform the task, starting at the time you want. Once you feel like the habit is formed, you can turn off the reminder.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio (Java and xml).

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never written an Android app before, hence we had to learn from scratch. Writing this app in itself was a challenge, but the most challenging part was the back-end: using the alarm manager, using the date and time picker, navigating through the layouts and attempting to store data into a database. We had to learn everything, which made the process long and tedious.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, we managed to have an application that can do the most basic functions that we had expected. We are really proud of being able to learn so much in such a short time frame. Even though there are many flaws in the application, we have worked really hard for it and will continue to work even harder on making it exactly what we had intended it to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned the basics of developing an application with Android Studio. We have also learned how to work in teams, since none of us had previous experience with engaging in collaborative projects. Most of all, we have experience the spirit of hackathons, as we are also inexperienced in that matter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Develop A Habit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to improve our application, as there is a huge room for improvement. First of all, the logic behind the code isn't really strong. Also, our code doesn't handle most exceptions. Most importantly, our application currently has difficulty managing multiple habits that a user would like to add. Finally, the UI/UX experience is not the greatest as we didn't invest a lot of time in that.
