                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yu-Gi-Oh! was a shared interest and we all came to a conclusion that existing online Yu-Gi-Oh! marketplaces, while helpful, are generally organized chronologically (by set of release). When actually building a deck, these online marketplaces are most helpful when a user already knows what they want to buy; if they do not know which combination of cards they want, it is difficult for them to discover new cards and their synergies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to create a web application that allowed players to search cards by different organizing factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our current Duelist DB allows users to search cards by name and to read information regarding average price and general card information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found an open-source Yu-Gi-Oh API and stumbled through JQuery and Javascript as we learned to read the JSON files and tripped through bootstrap in an effort to make it pretty. We created a rough proof-of-concept and attempted to deploy it in heroku (although at time of writing, we have not succeeded in doing so).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was very disconnected; due to transportation, one teammate was not able to hack on Friday, and another teammate was sick for all of Saturday. This made coordination difficult. Compounded with our lack of experience with the technologies we were using, we ended up not making as much progress as we had hoped. We couldn't figure out how to resolve multiple origin domain problems, so we can only run locally with a Chrome extension Allow-Control-Allow-Origin, that resolves this issue (at potential risk to security).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We technically didn't have any back-end stuff until we had to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time we got a picture to show was very rewarding, and we were pretty happy with how the app ended up looking (when viewed locally).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about what front-end people have to wrestle with and also gained a deeper understanding about how heroku is used for the backend as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Duelist DB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given more time to develop it, we would fully deploy it and add more substantial search options. We would also sanitize input; at present, it is case-sensitive and only recognizes exactly-spelled names, as well as fix the multiple origin domains problem that plagued us throughout development.
