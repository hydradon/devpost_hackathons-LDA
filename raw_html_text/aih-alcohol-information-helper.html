                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heavy alcohol consumption is a prevalent problem across the United States. In 2017, two students from Santa Clara University passed away from alcohol-related activities. College students across all states continually participate in such reckless behavior, adding to the number of alcohol-related deaths each year. While we cannot stop people from drinking alcohol, we can make sure that people are aware of the proper safety guidelines and have quick access to emergency services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website helps informs readers of the dangers of alcohol, as well as what to do when a friend gets alcohol poisoning. The user can hover their mouse over the icons to reveal information on the webpage, including the source links at the bottom of some pages. One feature of the website is the BAC calculator which prompts the user for gender, weight, amount of alcohol consumed, and time since the first drink. Using that information, the website calculates that individual&rsquo;s current BAC and gives a warning if that BAC is too high. Two more defining features of the website are the abilities to send 911 a voice message for help through the browser and locate nearby hospitals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was mostly designed in HTML and CSS. Various user interactions with the website were coded with the help of Javascript - this includes the BAC calculator and the location tracking aspect of the website. Our website calls 911 using a Twilio API which we hosted on a local server. The map of nearby hospitals was created using a Google Maps API and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had was the learning curve. This is our first hackathon and both of us are beginner programmers, so we had to cram learning web development in about 36 hours. Neither of us had created a website before. Initially, we struggled implementing the Twilio and Google Maps APIs into our website, since we also have never used APIs before either. Although the learning curve was steep, it was definitely rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On top of the couple of new languages we learned, we also learned how to incorporate APIs into our code. Another thing we learned was how to collaborate, with the help of Github. The adrenaline rush of coding through the night, solely powered on caffeine, taught us that it&rsquo;s possible to learn anything with the help of commitment and willpower.

                <p>
                    The next step for AIH will be a mobile application for easier access. It is much easier to whip out your phone application at parties than to open up a web browser, and time is key in saving someone&rsquo;s life.
