                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our studies we had a lot of difficult exams and preparations to them weren't effortless at all. We tried to think how we can make these preparations more effective and less time-consuming, on one hand. Withal, we live in the era of space ships, large IT systems, and robots. Thus, we need something technology driven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of us work with tools for automation of workflow or development process. So we took one of the most tedious, time-consuming, and completely non-tolerant to mistakes processes during exam preparation. This is cheat sheet preparation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important thing - those cheat sheets could be absolutely shareable!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've developed a simple UI that allows to generate a cheat sheet and save it to PDF file. All you need is just to input your information, formulas and graphics using simple formulas (TeX and/or usual symbols). Yes, we can even generate complex graphics!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, every cheat sheet will be available in our blog, making itself accessible to every student.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we have a Python Bottle framework for our backend, hosted on IBM Bluemix platform. We use Python code, many libraries, and some logic for working with data coming from UI. We also use Wolfram to generate graphics (and it is awesome!). By the way, thanks to Namecheap for .club domain. Of course, as we are a web service we use JQuery, JS, and some CSS to make our services fancier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our blog and as a file storage we use Wordpress and CloudUp (thanks to Automattic).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a main configuration storage, metadata storage, really very multi-purpose storage we use Clusterpoint. It is very comfy to have your copy safe somewhere in cloud ;)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, as a good team we use private repository in GitHub.
                </p>
