                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reducing paper and allowing users to keep track of their finances easily.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows imaging of receipts and storage of data, and displays output in expandable list. Has an analytics page but it doesn't do anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio for the app. Python with flask and Microsoft's computer vision API for the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with Android Studio and it took a lot of effort to get to grips with. Started with Google's vision API which didn't work with our server.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App takes photos and server returns data mostly successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android dev is horrible.

                    What's next for Big Spender
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting basic features working properly. Improving design. Adding analytic functionality.
