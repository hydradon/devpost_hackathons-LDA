                    Built and run in Java, our program uses Google Cloud Vision API to  detect general traits and features in your outfit. We provide a general rundown of those features and generate a score to each style category. In addition to style breakdown, discover what the colour you're wearing says about yourself.

                    Further development would include using AI built on a custom data set that generates more application specific labels. Using custom data would also enable more specific detection of items and accessories, allowing the application to provide real advice for achieving certain looks. (And also integrating it into a mobile app.)
