                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When people participate in polls it is often not representative of the population. I wanted to alleviate this by using Natural Language Processing to create a real-time data analysis tool capable of pulling information from Twitter around a topic and using that information to make predictions about the population. Imagine a company able to get real-time feedback of a product without needing to ask for it, a company to be able to find needs in a marketplace and quickly design products to fill them, or a person getting real-time statistic about what actual people think about their elected representative; the options are endless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program first uses the Twitter API to access all the tweets around a given topic. It proceeds to then generate the real-time statics data regarding the "Emotional Tone" of the tweets as well as the "Social Tone".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I access all the tweets around a given topic using the Twitter API. I then have a custom made api which cleans and parses all the data. I use IBM bluemix to run sentiment analysis on the tweets. From there I make predictions about the overall tone of the people.
