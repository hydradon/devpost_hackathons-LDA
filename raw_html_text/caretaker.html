                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into this, we focused on social good, and decided to create an interactive, contact system which benefits the elderly and disabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the start our goal was to create an application that would help bring people together, our first idea was to create a website that users could share their skills and talents between each other. Unfortunately the other two members of our team was unable to make it so we were forced to adapt and create a new project. This new revised project is what we have currently. The goal is the same but with emphasis towards helping disabled individuals better use their computers. Our project is multi-part consisting of a webcam, mouse tracking unit where you can move your mouse through the webcam. The other part allows you to capture a sound clip and use that data in conjunction with the Twilio API to call the recipient where it plays the audio file to them.
