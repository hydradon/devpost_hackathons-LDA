                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always needed one central, useful list app, one that can keep track of wish lists for Christmas, books I want to read, as well as grocery shopping. For simply making the lists, notes or reminders is sufficient but I wanted something more useful, an app that would allow for barcode scanning to add items, so people can have product details at their fingertips when buying the item as well as having a price compare so people never pay too much and have a way to buy items online. Sometimes though, one is unsure as to what one may need, such is the reason for being able to make certain lists public so they can be viewed by all users.
