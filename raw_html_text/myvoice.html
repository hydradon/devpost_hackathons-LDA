                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the project came when we came across some a broken crosswalk near our college one day. We reported via email to authorities but was not been fixed for a significant amount of time. The reason for this might be that authorities were not aware of how significant it is for daily commuters or they might have missed the email altogether. So the solution was to create an app to get connected with the local community and the concerned authorities; and letting them know our issues and their severity, so that it could be resolved in time. Also we want to help the authorities or the concerned person to know the current status of the issue so that they can prioritize accordingly
