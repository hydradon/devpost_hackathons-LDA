                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Inspiration comes from the current digital remote controller (i.e. slides switch, Surface Dial). We combined two types of the designs together to create a inexpensive and simple remote controller that won't affect user's hand gesture while you are doing the presentations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Switch slides, pen adjustment when taking notes  (or any kinds of simple operation to the device based on user's need).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Partical Photon, force sentitive resistor, and  3D-printed rings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming. Have to learn Photon from the scratch.

                    A simple, small device that can do almost everything.
