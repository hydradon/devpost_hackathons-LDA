                    A simple app that uses the Words API to generate rhyming, synonymous or randomized words. Ideal for poets or anyone looking for a little inspiration!  This app grew out of a desire to help people like my brother, who is an aspiring writer.  Specifically it has been found that randomized words, used as writing prompts can help to break through writer's block.  I did find the words API to be interesting if a bit challenging to use.  This API is still a work in progress, but what drew me to it was the detailed way that the developer attempts to form connections between words.  Words can be queried and randomized on a broad range of criteria.  This app is a basic webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I developed locally using Sublime Text 2.  I could refine and extend this app to a number of application, for example, a crossword puzzle assistant.
