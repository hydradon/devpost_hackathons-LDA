                <p>
                    Imagine that you have just lost the place you call home. Maybe you're a young 18-year-old who fled domestic violence, or perhaps your family just couldn't afford to pay the utility bill this month. Every day hundreds, if not thousands, of people just like you and I are pulled against their will into the cruel world of homelessness. Many times it comes suddenly, and it can be hard to know what to do, let alone where to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why our team developed
                    <em>
                        Homeful
                    </em>
                    - the app that helps match the homeless with the best temporary housing for them. Those suffering from homelessness may feel like there's no way out, but we hope that with Homeful, they'll remain hopeful.
