                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize that in today&rsquo;s world, people tend to seal themselves into one social bubble. The problem is on the days when you feel like dining out or trying a new restaurant, nobody&rsquo;s available to eat with you. Too embarrassed to eat alone, you end up with microwaveable mac &lsquo;n cheese or takeout that&rsquo;s cold by the time you get home, bitter about your social situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Buddy Network serves as a platform to connect foodies on their loneliest nights with others around them in similar situations and of similar palates to share a meal. Not only can they satisfy their cravings, we hope that these meetings can serve as a beginning to a lasting friendship for them as well.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Buddy Network was built with the WIX web development platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From HTML to CSS, from JavaScript to PHP, from Python to MySQL -- coming here, we realized that we knew nothing. Although we had an idea, we realized we did not have the technical skills to put any of this into action in the short amount of time we were given. It was difficult to find somewhere to begin and to move forward from the basis of which are skills were set. For us, putting our idea into motion itself into motion was the biggest challenge.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the crisis we faced trying to get anything done in the first few hours with no experience, we are proud that we managed to even make a little part of our idea into something physical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that in the world of coding, we still have a long ways to go. However, this has provided us a chance to learn more about web development as well as the ins and outs of WIX.

                    What's next for Food Buddy Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, ensure that all sections of the platform are fully functioning with no errors. As for future developments, perhaps we can add additional features such as foodie group outings as well as better search filters. Furthermore, the security of our platform can be improved to ensure the safety of ay user who happens upon the Food Buddy Network.
