                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration mainly came from reminiscing on our favorite childhood television shows and reflecting on how editors, software engineers, and other behind-the-scenes people involved in technology impact the final product of the show. Specifically, we were interested in pursuing a feature in the show,
                    <em>
                        iCarly
                    </em>
                    ,  produced by Nickelodeon. In this show, the characters use "Pearphones" instead of risking the Copyrighted Apple iPhones. Although these "pearphones" were designed, modeled, and used in real life, we hypothesized how video editors could've simply replaced the apples on the devices with pears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picture PEAR-fect takes in a user inputted image and replaces its Apple logos with pear logos! This is perfect for clients who need a find-and-replace technology for pictures, which is always in demand for a plethora of reasons. This website has an unlimited capacity to take in images and place pears on top, as the user can simply refresh the page and repeat the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team faced many challenges as we completed our project. Some include, but are not limited to figuring out and navigating the API we decided to use and transposing the pears onto the Apple logos. These roadblocks were quite severe, as they each costed us a couple hours respectively to understand and get over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the project, all of us learned new things. Primarily, our frontend development knowledge increased by twofold, as a majority of our team were new to fairly new to CSS, HTML, and Javascript. Additionally, we all encountered individual roadblocks at different steps of the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Picture PEAR-fect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additional capabilities our team would like to implement would be a button to save the newly "Pear-ifyed" image to the user's local computer. Next and definitely more taxing would be a functionality to photoshop the pears in a more real sense. We could use photo filters, blurring, and cloning to make the pear blend into the background of the picture seamlessly. However, we are extremely proud of our accomplishment with Picture PEAR-fect!
