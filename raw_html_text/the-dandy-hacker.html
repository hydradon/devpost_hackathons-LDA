                    This is a small taste-test of a game with potential to grow. You are a victim trapped within a room inside Rettner Hall and must solve puzzles to escape. The puzzles have a computer science flavour to them, giving computer science students an edge when playing.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unreal Engine was used for assembly, 3DSMax and Photoshop for asset creation, and Wolfram Technologies for the custom converters.

                    Trying to compress 1GB of data into the 35MB limit as we were told during the last 15 minutes.
