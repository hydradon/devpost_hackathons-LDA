                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The class management system for Florida Polytechnic University is lacking in some departments, including Google Calendar integration. Other universities have this capability built into their course management system, however, we do not. We made this with the intention of making hundreds of students live just that much easier when registering for classes every semester.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chrome extension uses the Google calendar API as well as a web crawler script to parse the CAMS system to find course information including Start and End dates, as well as class times and locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by accessing the Google calendar API and pulling data from CAMS and importing it into the Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was no clean way to merge the google calendar and google extension APIs. The problems with the web crawler included having to parse a server-side website.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning almost everything that we accomplished. 
Learning jQuery, google APIs, HTML, how to parse server side websites, and how to merge all of it together in the end.
