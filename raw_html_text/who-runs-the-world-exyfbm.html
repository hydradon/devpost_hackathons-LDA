                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about enamored us as children: dress-up, decorating rooms, and other games. We then decided to combine those aspects to create a game that not only appeals to young girls but also teaches them the code behind the game. We wanted to introduce coding to girls in a welcoming environment where their curiosity can flourish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows girls to design their own world while also learning the code behind it. Users input values (inserting an object of their choice: person, place, background, etc.), see the code behind the object based on their input values, run the code, and also see the final output immediately. This provides immediate feedback and the girls can see how powerful their code is. Through this, they "run" their own world and make it their own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio's Windows Form in Visual C#. The graphics were made in Medibang Paint Pro and Pixaki with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. The backgrounds were open sourced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most prominent is making the images' backgrounds transparent in the game and make them able to overlap each other. We also faced difficulties in finding out how to place images based on the user's position of their click. The hardest part of the project was making up the idea and the logistics of it afterwards. Combining customizing the world  whilst teaching java was a difficult balance to maintain because the game could easily just be another "make your own home" game or be a Java textbook.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to create a complete, working program in a short amount of time with a team is what we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team and negotiate to pursue a common goal. We also learned about object-oriented programming through Visual Studios Windows Form. We also learned that even though one of us did not know how to code, there were still many roles that they could play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Who Runs the World?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could add more assets and expand to more languages. We can also increase the difficulty for older audiences who already have some background in programming. This can be done by starting them off by filling in blanks of an actual script to code their own properties and eventually creating their own programs. Additionally, more graphics can be made to "pretty up" the game, such as custom buttons, a loading screen, and other refining features of a game to appeal to girls further.
