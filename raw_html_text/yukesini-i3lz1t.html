                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I Have a problem to decide where i need to go to hangout, especially when i go alone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I came alone at cafe and there is a beautiful girl at the table in front of me. I want to make a contact with her, but i have no idea how to do it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the cafe full loaded or my table is far away from waitress and bar, i have problem to calling the waitress and also i cannot be in waiting line to cashier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I can track my order, of course it's gonna be problem after 20 minutes my order it's not coming yet.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So i decided to solve all of the problem in one single apps called yukesini. to inspire me find the right place, simplify order, manage my order, media to meet the people with permission and manage my spent money
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i built mobile apps that serve recommendation place like restaurant, cafe or coffee shop. From there apps have ability to order with only scan qr code directly from their table to avoid queue in bar or calling busy waitress. If the order has been made, you can see list of people whose already check in there, and you can request one of them to be your friend. So i hope there will be a human to human contact among the customer. All of your visited place and all of your spent money will be recorder on your profile, so you'll know how much you spent for hangout. of course you can control your budget and give you warn if too much.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    it will take a long time to educate partner and sign an agreement with them. also how to educate people about this new things for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ignoring human to human contact, lead us to stress and anger person. I learn that negative value of social media nowadays is people avoid human to human interactions, so this is the time to bring back social value with this media..
                </p>
