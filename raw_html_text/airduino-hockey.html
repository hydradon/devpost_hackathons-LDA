                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something fun with technologies we hadn't used before so we decided to make a VR game using an Oculus Rift and a Thalmic Myo. However, due to not being able to find an Oculus Rift or a Thalmic Myo, we decided to use stick an Arduino to a glove and create our own game controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Airduino Hockey is a VR air hockey game controlled with hand movements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a custom motion controller for the game since we couldn't get a Myo or a Leap Motion. We built it using an Arduino and a SparkFun 6 Degrees of Freedom Breakout - LSM303C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Blender to create the models, Gimp for image editing and Unity to put it all together.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Building the hardware part since we didn't have previous Arduino experience and we weren't expecting to have to do it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using magnetometer data correctly in order to move the arm inside the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We didn't have much Unity experience, so that was a challenge as well.
