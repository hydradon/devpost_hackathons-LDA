                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At McMaster it seems that 1/5 people have a recurring mold problem at McMaster. A close friend had to call the cops on their landlord. Another friend also. The list goes on. People deserve better. People WANT better. It's the perfect market to give people what they want. The solution? A user-data-driven social platform to detail historical records of your residency experience: TrueHousing.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an environment for sharing the history and experience of your stay as a tenant. In Hamilton tenants are subjected to mold, landlords illegally turning off heat, and many other illegal breaches. This app aims to make mainstream the history of the house you plan to rent, including both environmental experience and physical nature of the house, to avoid people being baited by seemingly nice places to rent.
