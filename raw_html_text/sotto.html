                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started simply with a sentence "Jump into a mirror and the world reverses". I don't know exactly when I scribbled that down in my list of game ideas, but the concept stuck out to me when reading through my game jottings the eve of QHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the idea of a MetroidVania 2D platformer game and adds another dimension to it. Rather than working your way through levels and unlocking new areas, you can now unlock entirely new areas which were literally right under your nose. The player can now switch between walking on top of the solid ground, to walking on the boundaries of the inside of the ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built entirely using C# as the language, and with the standard Unity Library. To create visuals Gimp was used, and a select few sound effects were sourced from free sound.org.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part for me was the artistic side. I am no artist by any means of the word, which is apparent from the graphics. The second biggest challenge was the actual level design itself. Rather than just building a level and adding platforms and objects in at a whim, I needed to think how those solid areas would be interacted as if they were negative space instead of solid. While playing, your brain quickly switches back and forth between what is solid and what is not, but in designing any sort of platforming area this was not so simple.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm fairly proud of what I've accomplished game-wise in the short time limit provided by this hackathon. Working solo has also allowed me to hone my skills in Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a few new and better ways to manage many instances of a single prefab in Unity, as well as how to use and control audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sotto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd of course like to expand upon the idea, however I would first need to do a complete level redesign, as the current level's scope is way off and also much to linear. I'd be interested in adding other features like moving around certain objects that allow you to traverse to places that you wouldn't have been able to otherwise.
