                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From personal experiences, to stories told by those who actually really care about their health and performance in exercises, we learned that keeping track of every type of exercise you do can be a painful task to accomplish. RapidFit is a tool that can be easily used by anyone and will take care of such task for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RapidFit listens its user through google assistance platform, catalogs every exercise and how many repetitions of each one were made on that day. RapidFit then utilizes a premade HMTL template to output graphs containing the development of a person`s daily exercise routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RapidFit`s front-end was developed with Javascript, HTML, CSS and Google Assistant Dialogflow.  The back end and cataloging portion of the application was made using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the fact that our team had little to no experience with developing a back-end or voice to text API`S, integrating these two technologies and understanding how they work was by far the most challenging task we ran into in this event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of how we were capable of learning completely new fields of tech for us in a weekend.  This was not only a gratifying experience, but also something that will stick with us for a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than all the technical skills that we learned from this experience, we also gained experience coordinating a large scale project between team members in order to solve a problem in a short time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RapidFit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RapidFit still needs major improvements. We plan in implementing calorie burn and weight tracking services to the program.  Viewing a users progress by week, month and year are also major functions that are yet to be added to the RapidFit graphing interface.
