                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 2015-16 school year, roughly
                    <strong>
                        1 in 4 high school seniors in the Los Angeles school district didn&rsquo;t graduate.
                    </strong>
                    [1] It&rsquo;s not so much that they failed&mdash;the system failed them. Its not the teachers fault either&mdash;with the current decrease in federal funding and increasing class sizes, teachers are working harder than ever and simply can&rsquo;t devote enough individual attention to each individual student. High achieving students are often bored in class, and other students don&rsquo;t have the personalized care they need to succeed. Teachers don&rsquo;t have enough time to individually engage each student, leading them to unknowingly overlook the problems their students are facing. That&rsquo;s where Minerva comes in&mdash;targeted machine learning, facial recognition, and sentiment analysis gives teachers huge insights into the needs of each student even in the face of increasing class sizes and decreasing budgets.
