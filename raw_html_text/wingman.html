                    We were all feeling awfully single one day, and we wanted to create a website that would allow us to leverage our friendships and social networks in order to find bae. Nothing says true friendship like giving your friends a 5-star seal of approval along with a glowing review of their personal characteristics on an online dating app. We are inspired by the idea that our friends know us better than we know ourselves, creating an objective picture of who we are.

                    When you pull up Wingman, you will be prompted to login or create an account, and once you create an account, you will be prompted to fill in basic information about yourself (age, location). Using the search function, you will be able to find hot, local singles in your area, and read reviews about what their friends had to say about them. In addition, you will be able to send out a link to your friends, allowing them to submit reviews for you, adding to your profile.
                </p>

                    We are proud of creating a web app that removes the onus on you to create an engaging and interesting profile of yourself, but rather placing this responsibility in the hands of your loyal, trusted friends. We believe that people are the sum of the friends with whom they surround themselves, and we believe that Wingman provides a dynamic platform on which we learn about others, and ourselves.
