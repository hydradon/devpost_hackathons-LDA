                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of high school students we are often careless with our energy consumption and carbon emissions. So we were really excited to come up with a way to solve the problem using interactive and fun features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app essentially tracks energy consumption/carbon emission of a user through their day-to-day life. The app offers a way to track how much energy you have consumed by performing simple tasks such as leaving the lights on or utilizing an air conditioner. Alongside this, the web app is able to scan items and identify eco-friendly products. As an incentive to track their energy consumption, the user can build their own virtual garden where they can use points earned from tracking activities/scanning items to grow the garden.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each person fulfilled a specific role in the development of the websites, such as page structure, backend, feature implementation, research, and logistical analysis. However, we were able to offer input on each aspect of the design process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website is comprised of JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL, jQuery, and PHP. MySQL is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost every part of this project was built by hand with the exception of the bar-code reader. Besides that, every line of code was written by one of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from a single API, the entire site was built from scratch. Given the scale and complexity of the project, the challenges were inevitable. The first challenge we faced was learning an obscure API to read and search for bar-codes. After that, we ran into difficulty creating and solving mathematical equations to create animations and build the front end. Lastly, we ran into problems with the domain names and hosting on a website so we resorted to hosting the application on a local host Apache server.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most impressive accomplishment of the whole enterprise is our implementation of HTML5 canvas, specifically its masterful depiction of 3 dimensions on a 2-d plane, and the portrayal of 2-d shapes in a 3-d space.
Other accomplishments included properly integrating MySQL and php on an Apache server for the back-end. On the front end and logistical side of the project, we are very proud of being able to research and utilize a obscure API in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest lesson we learned was that organization is vital to a successful project. There were many aspects to this project and it encompassed many areas of project development where intricate planning and high level understanding was required to complete the task.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Consrv
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for this project is to move it off local host and host it on a full Apache server. We are dedicated to making the web app more interactive and engaging for the user while also providing better information to inform the public about their energy consumption.
