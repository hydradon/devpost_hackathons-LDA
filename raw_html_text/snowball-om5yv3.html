                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coinjoins dramatically increase Bitcoin privacy by disrupting the heuristics used in chainalysis. Wasabi and Samourai Whirlpool have received widespread adoption over the past year. We strive to follow in their footsteps and provide another option for increased Bitcoin UTXO privacy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snowball seamlessly drops into existing wallet payment workflows and enables recipients to add an input to payments they are receiving &mdash; called a &ldquo;payjoin&rdquo; &mdash; obscuring both the amount of the payment and the flow of funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our implementation is partial as we never successfully integrated bluetooth connections with the wallet we chose to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Bridgefy&rsquo;s bluetooth-based mesh networking React Native SDK to implement a protocol for turning regular payments into payjoins without requiring any wallet interface changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then integrated this payjoin SDK into BlueWallet &mdash; a popular Bitcoin wallet for Android &amp; iOS &mdash; by making one small change to BlueWallets
                    <code>
                        createTransaction
                    </code>
                    function.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bluetooth was a challenge. It's not clear whether Bridgefy facilitated our efforts or complicated them.

                        Justin had to run to walmart to buy another Android phone for testing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working on React Native wallets significantly increased the build / toolchain complexity of our efforts. May have been quicker to take on a Python or Kotlin wallet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We attempted to also support Edge wallet, but couldn&rsquo;t get an API key from their automated system. They eventually sent one from support, but it didn&rsquo;t work.

                    <li>
                        Care and defensive design will be necessary to avoid privacy leaks in any final implementation
