                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to raise awareness for earth protection but also wanted to create a more effecient way to monitor and detect issues in cars.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OBD360 is a whole system that monitors literally everything that goes inside you car. Starting with base units, raw data is taken from your car by sensors such as a Carbon monoxide exhaust sensor, an air pressure tire cap sensor, an engine RPM sensor, and so on. These sensors communicate to an all new radio and GSM connected OBD2. The new OBD2 will have bluetooth and radio transmitters and recievers that can transfer data through the OBD platform. The OBD 2 sends live data to the car dashboard via 2.4gHz radio. The driver will have easy access to onboard disgnostics.In addition, the OBD2 uses GSM to send data to the Google cloud, which will be accessible through the ##OBD360 app we developed for iOS and Android

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3d printed models of the meters, OBD2 and exhaust pipes. Then we built two apps on different construction platforms. On the Microsoft PowerApps side, thousands of car data points were present. Extraneous data was removed, and then we used some HTML to organize the data into recent trips. On the AppyPie side, we organized the data into different categories accoding to what it was related to (ex:Gas Levels, Tire Pressure, etc.). Then we uploaded mock car data onto each data page.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to determine in what order and way the system would work. We had to decide between different methods of wireless connectivity such as Bluetooth, Radio, Wi-Fi, etc. based upon price and effeciency. In addition, we faced difficulties transitioning

                <p>
                    We have built many apps in the past, but this was by far one of the most remarkable. We felt accomplished

                <p>
                    I learned how to apply coding and tech to the automobile world. I also expanded on my app developing skills.
