                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to know what careers that you can do with the programming languages that you know and Google can be very vague.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an easier way to narrow down your job, internship and REU searches based on the programming languages that you know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using eclipse and javafx.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importing javafx into eclipse and our original idea failed so this was our backup plan.

                    We finished.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never to give up

                    What's next for Pear Programming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To expand the javafx program into html so that we can make it into an actual website.
