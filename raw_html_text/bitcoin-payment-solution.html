                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find out more about processing BitCoin Payments
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a BitCoin request using an existing API (coinbase), and uses an actual CoinBase wallet to create a request
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, CoinBase API, HostedCheckout used as a launching point
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an API compatible with VS 2013 that had the functionality we needed.  (It would have taken too long to get a license to a newer version of VS)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually integrating to CoinBase and my BitCoin wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about BitCoin payments
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BitCoin Payment Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would need to use oAuth2 for authentication to wallets other than my own.  Transfer code that is in HostedCheckout to our own API.  No redirect or text entry needed once 'Submit' hit - would integrate to user's wallet &amp; merchant's wallet seamlessly.  An API would enable our other payment platforms to also accept BitCoin.
