                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something that went in parallel with HackHarassment. On the the largest forms of medium that the prominent individuals in our society use is Twitter. People are use twitter know that usually they follow celebrities and prominent people or have friends that use twitter all the time. We wanted to make a hack that allowed you to analyze twitter profiles for hate speech and tweets containing derogatory terms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Loads and runs the Twitter API, gives you a field where you input who you want to analyze. The script gets all the tweets made by the selected individual, parses them and calculates how frequently
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the script in python, made the word bank, retrieved data from the api, changed the format of the data from the api and then compared and counted the words that were present in the word bank and api data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    flaky crew members and the fact that we switched from idea to idea and back to some old ideas plagued our voyage. Also writing something that had to work and wasn't pseudo code was a challenge because my ability to stackoverflow and google was mediocre at best.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I used the twitter API, wrote a script in python especially when I haven't done it for about 2 months. I'm proud that I was able to create a working project with results. The output from the API came out in a weird format that had other non English characters in it so I had to learn how to change it's encoding and how to turn dictionaries to strings, how to merge lists and how to problem solve from the mistakes I made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    more familiarity with lists, dictionaries, encoding, formatting data and how to use the Twitter API
                </p>

                    What's next for target-acquired
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to incorporate statistics and the ability to create accurate graphs and representation of data. With options to sort an individual's tweets by month or by year, so you can see the growth of (or decline in) hate in an individual. I know there are some python packages that I can use to make pie charts and other graphs.
