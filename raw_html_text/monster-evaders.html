                    We created this game because we wanted to have a new twist on old 8 bit platformers (like Mario!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game uses objects like a character in which you can control and maneuver. "Monsters" will be trying to swarm the character and the goal of the character to survive as long as possible. The game ends once the character comes into contact with the "Monsters".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had a difficult time implementing the double jump feature for the character and the automation of the movement of the "Monsters".
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very happy that we have a finished product and the graphics came out decent. Also the logic behind the automation of the "Monsters" was a very unique feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have learned a ton about 8 bit graphics design, implementing the artificial intelligence, and accomplishing challenging tasks through the efforts of teamwork and collaboration with other participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to launch the application to the App Store after some more fine tuning and additions of more complicated services, such as Game Center.
