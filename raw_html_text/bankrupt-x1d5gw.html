                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from the fact that we have an interest in game development and a personal stake in improving financial literacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game teaches people about financial literacy at the point where they most need it: right after they get out of college. This situation is becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the cost of education and the steep rates of student  loans. Our hope is that fewer educated people who are ready to contribute to the work force will be in debt when they get out of college and that even if they are, they know better how to deal with it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use Unity to create an application for Oculus Go, but even after many hours, we were only partially successful in figuring out how to utilize the equipment.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity software to make a VR game that would run on Oculus Go. Since many of us were unfamiliar with the software, there were many instances where we ran into problems with applying our ideas and making an educational and entertaining game.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successful in designing and implementing a game that can teach others about financial literacy. We were also able to see our board in the Oculus Go, which we were very proud of.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scratched the surface of how to utilize Unity and Oculus Go.
