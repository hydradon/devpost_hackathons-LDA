                    Me and Philip Chao have learnt coding (and C++) just recently. We were very scared of the outcomes, since we were only good at designing and not very good at coding. But as we learnt C++ through others, we found things to be really fun. We were able to learn how to do a magic square, which consists of the sum of rows/columns to be 15, and also design some apps.
