                <p>
                    On the first night of the hackathon, one of the whiteboards had "2 spots empty, 2nd column, 1st row" written on it. A change in the hackathon team building ecosystem needed an immediate change!

                    This app is meant to help build efficient cohesive teams before and during hackathons. It will help expedite the process of finding other students with similar interest and goals, as well as reveal all possible teammates in the vicinity without having to meet them all.
