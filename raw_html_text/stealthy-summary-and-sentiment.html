                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a CS student, there's a lot I don't know. Sometimes, I want to learn something but discreetly if I feel intimidated. How can one do this, and do this from anywhere? Learning should be made accessible to all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You text a Twilio number and it uses the Viacom data-point core API to get Star Wars data from the Swapi API. You can get the scrolling summary of any Star Wars movie as well as the sentiment of the summary (the one that rolls at the start of each film.) If you haven't seen the film, it's a good summary, and getting the sentiment can help you when you need to describe the film.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Node.js, Express.io, Viacom, Twilio, JavaScript, Ngrok for local tunnel

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the right endpoint/URL with Viacom data-point core and I started this Saturday night when the wifi was so bad I couldn't do the hack I'd started Friday that needed to send more data over my ngrok tunnel. Also, the wifi was still bad so it took time to test my text messages.

                    It works, others can use it, it's stealthy.

                <p>
                    Add translation, ideally with Google cloud. Add a website so there's a UI (right now it's just backend that powers the texting SMS with Twilio.
