                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time I plan on going somewhere, I always face the same problem! I don't exactly want to go to all of the normal tourist attractions because most of the time they are crowded. Moreover, if I am going to a place that I have been before then I want to go somewhere new. So I created this Alexa skill so alexa will tell the user about some non tourist locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask alexa for places to go to in a certain state and she will tell you about some unusual non touristy locations in that state
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created intentions for each state in the United States and then coded the lambda function, which basically includes what Alexa will say after a certain intent is activated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to create the lambda function and how to start the entire project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud that I got it to work and that if I ask Alexa places that I can go to in Wyoming then she might tell me to go to Devils Tower
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides learning how to create an Alexa skill, this project also helped teach me how to code in Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unique Places
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to include descriptions for each place so that the user can learn more about a place that they are interested in. Moreover, I want to go international and include places to go to outside of the United States.
