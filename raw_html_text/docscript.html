                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was to enhance the daily work of doctors in offices, create standards which could be used go give the patients more insight in their health and have the possibility to easy share results with any other doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DocScripts current state lets a doctor create a medical record from scratch for a new patient and prints an PDF which is fully readable and accessable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DocScript was build with Python 2.7, "Click" (scipting library), reportlab (pdf creation library).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some huge struggles and a long time to think about where to set and sadly losing my group mates on the way due to the late hours, I kept awake the whole night to read into the commandline cabalities of Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I actually finished a first prototype and that I was so motivated the whole time and learned so much in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That even if the start is very rough at a project and nothing works out like you want, there is always a possibility to reach a goal in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DocScript
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planned next are:

                    <li>
                        a real interface, easy accessible even for digital immigrants

                    <li>
                        a interface to connect with existing storing and transferring solutions for medical records.
