                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many mothers have a hard time producing enough breast milk. It is a serious problem when their child cannot eat what is available on the market. We want to connect these mothers with mothers that have excess breast milk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mothers with excess breast milk post how much milk they are willing to give away and what date they can meet up. Then mothers in need of breast milk can request for breast milk. Posts can be filtered by location and it is up to the mothers to set up a time and specific location.
