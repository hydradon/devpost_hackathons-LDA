                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buying groceries to cook with, ending up with a lot of excess ingredients. Subsequently forgetting about the excess and unfortunately wasting the food.

                    Piggu is a web app that keeps track of food (and their expiry dates) you have in your pantry/fridge and suggests recipes based on the food you have. Piggu will also allow you to store recipes from both the web and your personal collection. And with that, Piggu enables you to create smarter meal plans and automatically compiles your grocery lists. In short, Piggu helps you maximize your groceries&rsquo; potential, prevent food waste and save money.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Redux that is integrated with React, it does Actions that interact with the Django REST Framework to send requests such as filtering. For example, using the value from a react form to call a request API to fetch ingredients that contain the value. And after the API is called, it is processed through the Actions and reduced to a current state by the Reducers.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of recipe filters, integration of frontend and backend. Using two frameworks that don&rsquo;t typically work together, hence have limited documentation.
