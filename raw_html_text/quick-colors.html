                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create a game in Unity after attending Professor Blanchard's workshop on Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game display's a text object at the top of the screen and also displays 4 different colored rectangles, one of those rectangles has the same color as the literal text. The player must tap on the correct rectangle and do this repeatedly in a decreasing amount of time without tapping the wrong rectangle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the game using Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge I ran into was creating a timer bar that decreases and I fixed this by creating a green box and changing it's scale constantly to represent a loading/timer bar. Another challenge was creating a Highscore display that saves the current highscore after you close the game.
