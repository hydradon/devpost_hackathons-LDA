                    As college students, what we are all asked in our applications is our stories- our values, our goals, our accomplishments. Once we finally get into our colleges, how come these aren't emphasized in four-year plan creation? Many first years enter college unsure of what they want to do. But everyone has things that they care about. With DreamPlan, rather than choosing classes solely based on what is required of the degree they'll pursue, students will be guided towards paths that maximize their time in college. Using an algorithm that factors in their skills, strengths, weaknesses, interests, and passions, a student can be offered multiple schedules that meet their needs. The probability of being in classes they'll heavily invest interest in is higher when the student's personalities and goals are calculated into their academic path.
