                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going through the skills in the Alexa skills store I saw that there are many skills related to movies but there wasn't a single skill which could give me a brief overview or a synopsis of a movie so that I could decide whether to watch it this weekend or not. When I directly ask Alexa about a movie I either got no response or the description of the movie was not accurate. In India, people watch a lot of Bollywood movies but again in many cases Alexa wasn't able to recognise my query. That was the moment I  realised it is important to create a skill which will  work for all types of movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Movie Info is very simple to use. It will give you a brief overview or synopsis of any movie, be it an old movie or an unreleased movie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example just ask "Alexa ask movie info to give me a synopsis of The Godfather".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As recommended in the Alexa documentation, I used an AWS lambda function to handle Alexa requests.
I used the
                    <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en" rel="nofollow">
                        TMDb API
                    </a>
                    to search the movie asked by the user and then return the appropriate results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this entire skill on my own, as a student, in the middle of a semester. It was very difficult to find time to consistently work on this.
Also sometimes it might get a little difficult  to pass the certification process but going through the official documentation always helps !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can use this skill to even get synopsis of regional movies of any language. I believe this simple skill would be very useful as you get the results instantly. The skill is certified and published to the Alexa Skill Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have acquired more experience around the Alexa built-in slots and how Alexa manages the utterances. I have understood that the best way is to keep it simple, but with some tweaks in the logic, everything can potentially be achieved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movie Info
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the skill supports searching only movies but it will also support TV shows in the future.
I will also be releasing the skill in other languages too.
