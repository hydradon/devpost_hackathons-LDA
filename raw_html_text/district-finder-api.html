                        The Problem
                    </strong>
                    I can think of a handful of reasons a civic application would need to be able to look up various districts at the city, county, state, or national level. Also things like TIRZs. You should be able to provide a latlong or a county precinct number and have it return this data in a JSON/XML form for use in other applications.

                    <strong>
                        Project
                    </strong>
                    Backend interface, database, and end user API where the following can happen:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Admins can upload a geojson, shapefile, etc. of voting precincts with an expiration date (usually they can only change at certain times by law).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Admins can then upload the same for district/area/zone/whatever.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Code runs to build a less intense to query database mapping the larger areas down to what precincts are in them.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            API users can make queries like
                            <code>
                                /geo/precinct/29.7218989/-95.4562183
                            </code>
                            or
                            <code>
                                /geo/county/29.7218989/-95.4562183
                            </code>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            JSON/XML spat out with known data, and a tag of some sort if it's outdated according to the expiration set.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Why It's Important
                    </strong>
                    On it's own, it's not hugely important, but you could build all sorts of things with this data. Especially if the raw files were also provided somehow to download.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Off the top of my head, you could build the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Simple district listing interface:

                            A digital version of the League of Women Voters Voter Guide, but without showing you all the stuff you can't actually vote for (the project I plan on doing next). For the primaries it was 51 pages. It took me 2 hours to get through, and at least half the time was just trying to find what was relevant to me.
