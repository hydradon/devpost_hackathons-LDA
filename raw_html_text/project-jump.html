                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By being part of different student organizations, we realized that sometimes we want the collaboration of somebody else with a different perspective in an another field. Our student organizations are full of computer engineers and computer scientists, but sometimes we would need, for example, somebody who had graphic design, art, or business experience to complete some projects. We noticed that it was hard to connect with these students since we were not sure on how to approach them or where to. We thought about this idea so students can connect with each other in the same university and they would be able to collaborate in projects together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application would let you login into your dashboard and allow you to create and manage your projects and the projects you are part of from other students. You will be able to use other resources available within your dashboard such messages and emails, to communicate with your project teammates and notifications as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we only have built the front-end of this website. We started by using the bootstrap framework to come up with our main home page. Then, we found several resources to create the dashboard. We modified the HTML and CSS from these resources to our convenience. We created other different html pages to provide us with the login page, the create projects page, and the manage projects page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of good knowledge in front-end development. Also, our team ended up consisting of only 2 people, therefore, we were not able to do anything else but the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with the learning curve, my partner and I managed to finish the pages we planned to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate, more about front-end, and how to use git as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Jump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to build the back-end of this web application since this would be our next step after finishing up with the front-end part. We hope to be able to keep collaborating in this project!
