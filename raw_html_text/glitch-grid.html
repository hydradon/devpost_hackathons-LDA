                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought in a game with simple graphics and gameplay. The first idea was something like a cave exploration, but ended being something different. 
The meaning of the movements may be thought as different height levels, where you can't jump from a so high one because you would be hurt, nor climb a too high one, because you are just a regular human being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Arrows to move
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ctrl+Arrow to swap the cells in that direction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        R to reset the map
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The goal is to collect as many coins as you can. To reach them you will have to find a path through the map, which consists in cells of different colors, and each color constrains your possible movements. You can also swap the color of the cells that surround you in order to find new ways to the coins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built entirely with the Unity3D engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building for WebGL I had many errors because my system path had some no-ascii characters (my name) and couldn't build and I had to trick building the project from a usb.
                </p>
