                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we make new friends or coworkers, we always get asked a question: "Where do you want to go to eat?" Whether it's out of politeness or genuine indifference, we often find ourselves awkwardly trying to think of restaurants that everyone would enjoy. Here's where our app takes over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app will take in a set of three preferences: your maximum price point, the furthest distance you'd be willing to travel, and your minimum review rank (ie 1 star or 3 star restaurant).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well as using Firebase to host the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the both of us are fairly unfamiliar with web development, we had to learn a lot along the way. In addition, the frontend was particularly challenging for us to make because we often had to search everything up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also had never used Firebase before, but thanks to the tutorials we were able to learn quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about web development, such as a greater understanding of what the server versus the client handles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let Us Eat!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to develop this app, mostly to improve the frontend.
