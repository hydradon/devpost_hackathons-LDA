                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in the accessibility track, and what's to create an application that would help people who are dealing with a mental illness, like Alzheimer's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that helps people with Alzheimer's, particularly the elderly, maintain their long-term memory through short-term reminders the important aspects of their lives, such as their past careers (if they're retired), their family members, and keeps them posted daily about things they should be doing to keep themselves mentally and physically well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by gathering information about Alzheimer's, especially what people with disease experience. We started brainstorming ideas for how we could make life easier for this group of people and we thought an application would provide a widespread, yet personalized solution. We started building a rough sketch of a website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, we which wrote in Visual Studio and displayed everything on HTML files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unsure of exactly which libraries would be most useful, and we had not planned exactly all of the features that could have been added because we just experimented with different solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to generate a very realistic prototype of this application, which includes a to-do list that users can add to and remove items from, embedded audio and video recordings of music that a user may like, and images of family members through we used the Microsoft Computer Vision API to demonstrate how we could help users with Alzheimer's identify both people and places of interest more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to work more efficiently and collaborate, and also be clear of how we how we wanted to split up the work, because were all unsure and trying work on similar things, when delegating them would have been easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alzheimer's Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve this application by connecting it to a database and allowing users with Alzheimer's to gain more awareness of what is around them in their daily lives, such as information on their friends and family members, important facts or words form the dictionary when they have trouble communicating, and better location services to help them find their way when traveling.
