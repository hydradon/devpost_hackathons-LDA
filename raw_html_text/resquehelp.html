                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ResQue facilitates the difficult process of managing victims, dispatchers, rescuers, shelters, and obstacles when disaster strikes.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to go with a simple web app using MEAN stack, containerize it using docker. We leveraged the ESRI and NEXMO for mapping and communication. ESRI api helps us map rescuers and people who need assistance on the map, we can also map nearby shelters and hospitals to assist relief. NEXMO api allows us to send text messages so people know that help is on the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we intended to use the Arity API to route rescuers around problem areas, we found it difficult to use the data as we intended. We did not have enough time to implement full persistence in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is to enable the community to help each other, and not just wait for official responders to help them out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disaster response being a difficult field to tackle, requires a lot of coordination among many parties and organizations, especially when communication systems might themselves break down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ResQueHelp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app can move beyond gathering information to suggesting courses of action. Machine Learning can be employed to learn from past disasters and suggest courses of action based on scenario. Help lessen the burden on dispatchers who have to keep track multiple things.
