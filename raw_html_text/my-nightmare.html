                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD doing research in speech processing. This project is inspired by one of my nightmares, the most academic nightmare of all.
In that nightmare I was singing.
Then somehow the upper sphere of my head was chopped off (including nose and everything above), but I KEPT SINGING! Understandably, I could not produce nasal sound anymore so my singing was very "leaky".
Then somehow the other half of my head was also chopped off (I have only neck left), but I KEPT SINGING! Because all I have is vocal cord, my "singsing" became just "viberation sound". And I just kept making that sound...
                </p>

                    because I had no experience with 3d modeling, I ended up used all my time there...
