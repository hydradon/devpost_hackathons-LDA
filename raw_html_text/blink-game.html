                    <li>
                        Our lack of ability and our desire to challenge ourselves.
## What it does

                    <li>
                        There are two players
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the players press all buttons to start game
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the lights go through a sequence to show that it is starting
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We used an arduino uno and the arduino software
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The LED lights were outputted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The buttons served as inputs
## Challenges we ran into
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When we attempted to assign scores and have a winner, player 2 always won
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We did not have enough pins for the wiring
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We managed to get the scoring to work
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We did not have to make major concessions in game play for the lack of pins
## What we learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we learned how
                        <br>
                        ## What's next for Blink Game
1.multiple variations of game play such as two needing to be pressed because two lights go off
