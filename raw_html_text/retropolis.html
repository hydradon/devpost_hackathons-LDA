                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that everybody would like to play, and what is more enjoyable than Monopoly? So we took Monopoly as our inspiration. 
Also, we decided to use some of the most popular games of N64 as our properties because everybody loves old school video games!
