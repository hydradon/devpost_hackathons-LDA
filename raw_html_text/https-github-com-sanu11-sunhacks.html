                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot of times the internet connectivity in the rural areas isn't good enough for people to search their queries on internet.
Our aim is to provide them with the results they need for even though they dont have good internet connectivity.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Twilio for calling purpose. The user calls the number registered with Twilio. Twilio maps the number to the URL publicly available on the internet that runs the google assistant api  and returns back the voice results to the user through Twilio.
                </p>
