                    Non-profit organizations often struggle to find skilled workers to help their cause. We believe that this is not because people with skills do not want to help, but instead because there is no platform to help them connect with the Non-profit organizations. ActionState bridges the gap between Non-profit organizations and skilled volunteers. Skilled volunteers are eager to help and ActionState them the ability to fulfill that need.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ActionState allows Non-profit organizations to build a profit that advertises their specific skills based tasks that need to be accomplished. Volunteers can browse through the listed actions to find one that best fits their skill set.

                    How we built it

                    We used Firebase extensively throughout our project.
                    <br>
                    We used it both as a data-base and also to deploy our final application.
                    <br>
                    We used Angular 5 as the front end framework.
                    <br>
                    We used Illustrator in order to create design components.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next stage is to engage Non-Profit Organizations and have them make tasks for volunteers to complete. We then hope to create profiles for our volunteers to show off how they have used their skills to benefit their community.
