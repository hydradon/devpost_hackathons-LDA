                    As Slack has grown in popularity over time, it has become clear that the target audience of the software is in business-related contexts. For people who are involved in critical enterprises, it is important that they remain up to date on all the happenings of the business, including the discussions on Slack. But what if someone finds themselves in a situation while traveling, as an example, where Wi-Fi and mobile data are not forthcoming, and they're stuck with just texting capabilities, unable to check on the state of their business?

                <p>
                    That's where slackText (working title) comes in. This is essentially an interface we've developed that allows one to interact with slack wholly and completely through text message. All you need is a phone number, and you're able to see all of the slack channels in your workspace, subscribe and unsubscribe from various channels so as to monitor their activity, and you're even able to respond -- both contextually, with the reply being sent to the same channel as the most recent incoming message, or explicitly, with the channel of your choice selected. Plus, you're even able to set an alias so that people know whose messages are whose!

                    And that's another point worth mentioning, that this application is managed on a per-workspace basis rather than a per-person basis -- there's full concurrency for any number of people who want to monitor any number of channels. That means that at any time, when slackText has been set up for your workspace, you can rest assured that all of your employees will have access to their important information, anywhere they may go.
