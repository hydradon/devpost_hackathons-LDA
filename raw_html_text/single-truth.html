                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Insurance industry, information is passed down from one person to another leaving an abundance of opportunities for unrecorded change in information, increase in cost, inefficient auditing processes, and often creates a lack of data accessibility.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a single(or multiple) authorized user to complete the insurance form for a certain customer with required documentation, which is then published on a private blockchain that is accessible by the Insurance company and the reinsurance company.

                    In order to build a blockchain application with a web interface, there were essential background setups that were also required.

                    <li>
                        Installation of nodejs, web3, npm and geth BEFORE development

                    <li>
                        Smart Contract was developed using the solidity language

                    <li>
                        A UI was developed using HTML and CSS.

                    <li>
                        The UI was connected with the smart Contract using javascript, web3, and nodejs.
