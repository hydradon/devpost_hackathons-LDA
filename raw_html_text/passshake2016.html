                </h1>
                <p>
                    One password locking your account isn't always the most secure. We wanted to develop a new, unique way to add an extra layer of authentication to your online profiles. Something like a "secret handshake" is what we came up with.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    PassShake allows you to create a sequence of gestures, using one or both hands, to log you in to an account. You can create a new pass shake as well as test out an existing pass shake in our prototype.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Using Leap Motion to detect hand positions, we created an algorithm that detects specific hand gestures and compares them. We developed the application using Unity and Visual Studio with C#. We also used SourceTree with GitHub for source control.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There were various new technologies we all had to learn in order to develop the project. None of us had any experience with Unity, and most of us hadn't touched C# before. Also, learning to integrate Leap Motion into Unity took a lot of work.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity, Leap Motion, and C#.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What's next for PassShake
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope to develop the project beyond its prototype phase. Instead of just a proof of concept, we hope to expand it to work with online accounts, possibly by making it a chrome extension or web app. We could also improve the UI of the project; currently it is very rudimentary.
