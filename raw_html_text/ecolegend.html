                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The average American produces 11,444 lbs of CO2, according to data from last year. Sustainability is becoming more and more pertinent in our lives, and as such it is essential for get more people involved and more conscious of their consumption. In our developed lifestyles and environment, it is easy to lose perspective of exactly how much of an impact our actions have. Our goal was to make some eye-opening information accessible to an increasingly mobile consuming population to increase social consciousness and create some change, even by just a little.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app presents the user with the goal of reducing the amount of CO2 produced as a result of their energy consumption. Users gain an idea of their impact through simple questions which put the emissions into perspective. A core part of the design which was our goal and makes the experience unique was to gamify adopting sustainable habits to increase user engagement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with Android Studio in order to develop our idea as an Android app. The first idea was to present users with a preliminary quiz which will calculate about how much CO2 they produce in a year. Though answering more questions and tracking activities in regular intervals, our app could help the user keep track of CO2 they produced and try to provide helpful advice to be more sustainable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, members of the team have no experience with the android studio at all. We have to learn everything from the beginning. We ran into many problems of debugging, implementing new codes, transport data from one activity to another, and ways to calculate CO2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned and Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of is that we were able to learn new ways to code, a lot of new stuff, and struggles. Learning and navigating through Android Studio from scratch was monumental for us.
                </p>

                    What's next for EcoLegend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are trying to complete EcoLegend as it is not yet finished. Coming up with more quests to engage the user, and then incorporating more ways to show users how their appliances and everyday things impact nature.
