                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us are avid reddit users and have often come across this problem ourselves when trying to make a post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes as input the title and text body of a potential reddit post and displays top 5 recommended subreddits to post to using the ULMFiT deeplearning algorithm.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend built using django with a react frontend. NLP was done using pytorch with architecture inspired by the FastAi library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was not able to fully utilize the dataset as it was too large (1 million+ records). Given this and other constraints relating to training, it was difficult to get the model running in such a short amount of time.
