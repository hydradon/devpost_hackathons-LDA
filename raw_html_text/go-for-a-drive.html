                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a web application using the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After choosing whether you are walking or driving, and how long you want your trip to take, a route will be generated around your starting location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses Google's geolocation and maps APIs to translate your current address and generate a route. All code is in standard JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Randomizing points on a map often leads to paths that cannot be routed without switching between walking and driving. Inaccessible locations or major highways can drastically skew trip times away from the desired duration. Additionally, the distance and travel time correlate differently between crowded areas or open highways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm we created to both generate random routable waypoints and to select an optimal path based on the users request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team with a rapid development time frame.
