                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch plays Pokemon was really popular when it was initially released, and adding a DnD twist to the concept means that campaigns will be more fun, and playable with people who aren't physically around!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch votes on 3 scenarios, and based on the environment interactions are generated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js for the bot, PHP to connect to a MySQL database, and HTML/CSS to build a front end for encounters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to program the bot to connect with the database. We switched language for this at least 3 times! We started in Python, then switched to Java, and ended up with node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot works with Twitch chat, and the database and website are all set up and ready to go. Everything works on its own, they just aren't talking to each other yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a decent hosting site is difficult, node.js is awesome, and we all learned a lot more about different languages.
                </p>
