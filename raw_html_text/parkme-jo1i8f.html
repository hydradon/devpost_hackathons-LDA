                <p>
                    ParkME notifies you of nearby parking spaces that are free when you arrive at your destination. Once a parking space is selected, payment is quick and easy with an all-in-one design that allows you to pay and go.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio to develop the app and intend to continue development into the future as we add features and functions.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a great difficulty using the Google-Geofencing API and were not able to fully implement it into our app design, however with more time we believe it can be seamlessly integrated to allow for full app functionality.

                <p>
                    We are very proud of our UI and UX which provide a simple, quick, and easy parking solution for our users. Additionally our business plan allows for monetization and great scalability.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to implement parking zones and allow for users to reserve parking spaces (at a premium) and continue developing our use of the Google-Geofencing API. We would also like to add compatibility with google maps or Waze to provide instant parking notifications upon the arrival at a destination.
