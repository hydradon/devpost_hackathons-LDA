                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As fellow undergraduate researchers, we are aware that lab notebooks can get very unorganized and the risk of losing them is very high. We wanted to prevent that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that allows researchers to use their phones as a lab notebook. They can record their experimental procedures, data, images, and access useful features like a timer or an equipment guide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we have very minimum experience in coding and app development, we chose to use MIT App Inventor 2 for this project, due to its simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As previously stated, our lack of knowledge in coding prevented us from capturing everything we desired, and additionally, we had a hard time formatting the user interface, to make it more consumer friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we attended our first hackathon, created our first app, and worked very effectively as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a simple app in MIT App Inventor 2, along with many useful tips from the variety of workshops that were offered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual LabBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the app more easy to use, improve its aesthetics, and make it an overall more effective lab notebook.
