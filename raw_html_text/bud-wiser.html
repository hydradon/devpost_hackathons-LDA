                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a huge opportunity for machine leearning to be applied to AB Inbev's Off-Premise Operations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing SIFT and Hough algorithms, we solved availability and planogram compliance
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webcam on top of Intel Edison to take a picture, send it to be processed, and then notify the necessary parties
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulating the algorithms for our specific use, and finding clean data images were necessary hurdles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifying bottles (and lack thereof)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to solve the visible problem at a fraction of the cost, and exponentially faster
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bud Wiser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding in more features, and increasing the functionality and accuracy of things we have already demonstrated
                </p>
