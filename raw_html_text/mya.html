                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we're feeding curiosity, open search works great - e.g. "What day was Michael Jordan born on?".
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when we need to find goal-specific knowledge, it's easy to get lost in a million browser tabs, dodging irrelevant ads and content,
                    <strong>
                        without really finding what's really relevant
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all know search technology is super smart. But how we experience it is truly broken! Not all queries are equal, and when time matters, there's got to be a better way!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Introducing Mya - a beautifully simple way to create powerful search checklists - for yourself, for team members, for your customers and more - so you can get results from sources that matter to you.

                        Keeping things simple: powerful tech like Context.IO's email api can open up a can of awesomeness and the infinitude of possibilities. That can also bring complex UX challenge. Keeping things simple was the utmost challenge.
