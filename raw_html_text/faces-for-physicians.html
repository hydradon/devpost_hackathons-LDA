                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help out 3rd world countries that lack digital medical records. The patients have their own books of medical records that they bring with them. This is very inaccurate, especially with the trading and burning of the medical records. This project would relate medical records reliably and accurately, solving the problem of inaccurate records that make it hard to treat the ill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows a doctor to login and take a picture of a patient. If the patient is recognized, their medical record shows up. If the haven't be treated by a doctor using this technology before, the picture will then be trained to that person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mobile app on Android because the devices are cheap which would allow for higher adoption in the 3rd world countries. We also used Azure Face API to detect faces. For our database we used the local phones SQLite, but we planned to upload that to Azure SQL but we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into plenty of issues getting the Facial recognition to work. We also ran into issues with SQLite and the transfer process with Azure. We also wanted to save pictures, but we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of learning the new technology of Azure Faces API. We are also proud of how well the app came together and worked with what we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about SQL databases, Android Development and of course Azure and its capabilities, especially the Faces API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Faces for Physicians
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to make it more light weight and portable. Some restrictions right now are the lack of power and internet in third world countries so we would like to meet that need. We realized that we really wanted to meet all of these needs, but we have to take it one step at a time to create a great solution
