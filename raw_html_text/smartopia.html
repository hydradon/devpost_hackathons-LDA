                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smartopia is a
                    <strong>
                        virtual reality experience
                    </strong>
                    which puts you in the mayor's chair of managing a smart city by augmenting realistic man-machine interactions of the future. With billions of sensors and computers in the smart city alerting you every moment about the different happenings in a city, a lot of burden can be reduced by controlling the city from one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is The technologies used in Ready Player One can have smartopian consequences ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defend a cyber-physical attack on a water-treatment plant. Monitor the National Day Parade and ensure everything runs smoothly. Call the Police on the drag racers through 360 cams. Empathise with the pilots in the cockpit in Changi Airport. Get inspired with smart city plans of other cities such as NYC. Teleoperate a drone to monitor haze. It is _ purposely _ designed to be a VR experience rather than a full-blown interactive game. We wanted to respect the time constraints of a 24-hour hackathon and stay true to the theme. An experience is how we felt we could encourage most empathy from the viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the belief that we really love Singapore even though Mai and I are a PR and foreigner respectively. We recognize that Singapore is already on the way to become a Smart Nation (and is one in many aspects).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it with a lot of sweat and care and lots of help from our friends on the internet who believe in Creative Commons like we do. Our team name has the word "Free" in it in the same spirit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raycasts in VR, hands down. Nothing else comes close.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing almost everything that we set out to do. Sleep was the last of our concerns. We have been able to create a VR experience with both 3D models as well as real-life 360 videos. Covering 8 different scenarios in 24 hours wasn't trivial. I'm really proud of the work we have done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That a hackathon is like the cycle of civilizations. Good times create weak people. Weak people create bad times. Bad times create strong people. Strong people create Good times. WTH found a way to plunge me into doubt again and again within thirty minutes of feeling that I achieved something. Grinding each problem with this realization is the single-most important thing I learned.
Technically, almost everything about Unity that I know today, I know from these 24 hours. We went all-guns-blazing with the sceneries and 360 videos we could add, and we did. Finding the balance of quality and performance between low poly textures as well as hi-resolution ones. The idea that VR games can be designed so quickly these days. Mai learned a great bit about graphics design.
                </p>

                    What's next for To be added
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a huge project.  Scenarios ranging from how VR can help in National Service. We are glad that the Virtual Singapore initiative is trying to cover a part of it.

                <h2>
                    About the Team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamname - Free Solo commemorates the release of the real-life feature NatGeo documentary film by the same name which releases on the same day as this hackathon. Alex Honnold had the riskiest and the biggest achievement in the climbing community by scaling El Capitan in Yosemite without a rope under three hours.  In a similar fashion, I tried to attempt building a complete game as a mostly solo achievement with my teammate Mai taking care of the ground-level details in under 24 hours.
