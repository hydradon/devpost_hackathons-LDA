We wanted to add this to real-life transcription to classrooms.  Once we brought that technology to the student, it opened a rich world classroom possibilities.

                    is an immersive in-classroom tool for students and teachers that helps with focus and learning.
By providing unique tools, such as closed captions and 3D visual aids, it increases students comprehension and eases the teaching burden. While teachers can review the engagement level of the students, real-time transcriptions of the course support english learners. 3D tools let teachers push 3d objects to helps everyone better learn the material.  Differentiation lets a teacher push, say, a
                    <em>

                    Students see their desks transformed from a boring slab, into a dynamic workbench. The student can receive pushed learning-objects from the teacher.  Items can range from simple quiz questions, to personalized learning aids, such as 3D visual aids and experiential simulations.

                    We're using the Magic Leap to create a mixed-reality environment for the student.  Unity is our engine, and IBM Watson provides our real-time transcription services.

                <p>
                    None of us had worked with the Magic Leap before, so a lot of time was with system basics. We explored the capabilities of the system and spent way to long getting the dev tools installed.

                    is a fun proof of concept that shows a possible future for the classroom, but the underlying idea of the  teacher-student connected platform is a powerful concept that could implemented with existing technologies and budgets.  Our team hopes to incubate the concept into a practical product.

                    What would a one-year product look like? Imagine starting with Magic Leap classroom as the vision, but targeting classes with Smart Boards and iPads, which are in place today. A teacher you could still pushing quizzes, questions, and 3d objects to each iPad. Objects and questions could still be differentiated based upon the student. Teachers could project a room-sized object and students would lift their iPad to see an augmented view of the room, seeing that room-sized object.

                    Unrelated to learning objects, realtime transcripts, pushed to an mobile phone or to simpler over-the-eye displays (like Google Glass, or Epson Smart Glasses), could be implemented and tested in-class within the year.
