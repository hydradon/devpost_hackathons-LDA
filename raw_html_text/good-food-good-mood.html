                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wegmans' API was intriguing to us so we decided that we would create something useful and new to help those that are vegan, have Celiac's disease, or other dietary restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This would be an add-on for Instacart (Wegmans' partner for delivery services) to assist people with dietary restrictions or preferences in their online shopping experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this by improving upon the online and in-store functionality of the Instacart app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us were familiar with using an API in this manner, so this was a challenge. Learning about APIs from scratch took hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, we are proud of our model that we have created to replicate this aspect of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we learned some basics on how APIs work and can be called.

                    We would love to incorporate more settings in the future!
