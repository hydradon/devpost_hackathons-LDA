                    As a new high school IB student (Grade 9), I noticed that other Grade 9 IB students were having a hard time understanding how their overall mark was calculated. This is because the IB program uses a special scale that is different than simply calculating average. In order to solve this problem, I created a program that gives the overall IB level (and OSSD%). All that is required is input for four marks (one for each Criterion).

                    Since I am a beginner, I built this project using simple Python that I learned at yesterday's "Python for Beginners" workshop.
