                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We received our inspiration by the Fannie Mae flyers and the talk given by the Fannie Mae employees during the opening ceremony.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and HTML to code the base website and used CSS to make it look nicer. We then switched to Java after realizing it better suited our solution to the problem. Implementing a new solution and using the CSS from before, we were able to create a website which takes inputs and outputs whether the interactions are beneficial or detrimental to the seller.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we met was extracting data from JSON. The specific challenge that we met was the inability to download the data and change it into Java. This is because the formatting while in theory should be easy to extract, proved challenging in its implementation. The second challenge we met was setting up a GUI with the Java libraries. This came after the switch from Javascript and HTML, causing delays in transporting it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group managed to export and analyze 5,000 relative data points and produced a comprehensible analysis of these data points.

                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about different programming languages and how to style them using CSS. We gained a deeper understanding of arrays and built and reinforced knowledge of matrices. We also learned about collaboration while coding. Less related to coding, we learned how to efficiently analyze data and draw from it the relevant information that we would need.

                    What's next for Sold for Sales
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we should add more variables to better assess the different needs of a neighborhood and how these different factors affect the price of a house.
