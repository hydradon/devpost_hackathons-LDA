                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After I read about the huge problem of human trafficking, I decided to help. I didn't know how big a problem this was in the world until someone reached out to me. I realized that there had to be a better way to raise awareness for this huge problem. Here is the solution: An Alexa skill!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill educates users on the signs of a trafficked person and some appalling facts of the trade. It also notifies the user on what to do if you come in contact with a trafficked person and how to to help them.  Hopefully, this will raise awareness about how devastating a problem this is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using the Amazon Alexa Fact Skill Template. I also used AWS Lamba.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there is a lot of inaccurate information out there about human trafficking to make it sound like less of a problem. I dug in and found the real facts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the massive problem of human trafficking and how it affects a person's life. Everyone in this world only has one life, and nobody wants to spend it as a slave in the trafficking trade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Human Trafficking Awareness for Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to expanding the facts and maybe turning this into a trivia game with Echo Buttons, as I really love this new technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also want to expand this to other social use cases, such as domestic abuse. Hopefully, this can change the world.
                </p>
