                    A tweet where someone said

                        they were playing connect 4 on Discord
                    </a>
                    . They were doing it manually, so I decided to automate it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you play connect 4. To start, simply type
                    <code>
                        !c4 play @player2
                    </code>
                    (player2 is the @mention of someone else you want to play). The bot will pull up a game board, and the person who typed
                    <code>
                        !c4 play
                    </code>
                    goes first. Each person then takes turns clicking on the reaction that corresponds to the column they want to play in.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a library called discord.py for writing bots in Python.

                <p>
                    Win detection. I had to figure out how to detect who won the game. Fortunately, someone did that for me, and I could just incorporate their open-source code in my bot.
