                <p>
                    Having four different majors on our team (CompE, EE, MechE, and CS), we took a multidisciplinary approach to this hackathon. Working to all of our strengths, we modeled and 3D-printed a drone accessory that can lower sensors into environmentally unstable areas. These areas are determined to be environmentally unstable by analyzing images provided by the Planet Satellite Imagery API; although we didn't have access to a drone, theoretically our drone would go to the area provided by this code. Then, the drone would lower a set of sensors to pick up weather and other environmental data from the area. This data is then relayed back and displayed in an interactive information visualization that could help further see what is going wrong in the area.
