                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a commuter. I always have to commute from Stone Mountain to Atlanta. I'm tired of being late or sitting in the library waiting for a class to start because traffic wasn't different on my route.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a user sends their origin, destination, and time it takes for them to get ready, nTime will take these variables and calculate the time the user should wake up based on
                    <strong>
                        Real-Time
                    </strong>
                    traffic data. It will also show the user the temperature and weather of the destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask, a text file, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, a website, and a python script. On the website a user will post their their origin, destination, and time it takes for them to get ready. The site posts that into the text file. The python uses our makeshift database(text file) to calculate all the needed info for traffic and weather. We use a google and OWM api to draw info. We use the script to update our database with more info. The script also uses Flask to post the data to the raspberry pi. The Pi GETS this data and converts it into numbers. The numbers are then sent to the Arduino over serial where it is translated back into its respective info. It updates the Arduino with the time to wake up. Once that time is reached the alarm goes off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack was quite challenging for us because we didn't know much about networking. Once we figured out the networking between a laptop, Arduino, and Pi, it got much easier...until we had to interpret the Serial data the Pi was sending to the Arduino.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Everything
                    </strong>
                    But seriously, we're proud of the communication between the Pi and Arduino. The Pi can only send numbers over serial communication, so in Arduino we had to write an interpreter that processed the numbers the Pi sent and translated them into things we could display.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned multiple things, but we mainly learned about GET/POST requests, communication between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and using Flask for hardware hacks rather than keeping up with a website.

                <p>
                    We plan on
                    <strong>
                        continuing
                    </strong>
                    this project after UGA Hacks. UGA Hacks gave us the opportunity to bring a team together to make this hack, and we intend to use this hack to lead to creating an application that does the same as nTime but it accounts for more factors.
