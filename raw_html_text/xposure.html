                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to use VR for mental health issues from my conversations with other people during the summer. While in Utah, I met the owner of a startup which aimed to use VR in order to reduce anxiety. She described to me why she thinks VR is most effective for mental health rather than entertainment, encouraging me to think of using VR for exposure therapy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prototype has three scenes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A main menu allowing a use to choose which fear they are hoping to overcome.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Fear of Heights scene which helps users get over their fear of heights through exposure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Fear of Thunder/Lightning scene which helps users get over their fear of thunder/lightning through exposure
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the project using the Unity Editor, while writing C# scripts in order to create the effects that I wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into various challenges, most often with using the Unity software itself. Additionally, I struggled to write C# scripts to simulate lightning and thunder.
                </p>

                    Completing the project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Unity and write C# scripts, and ultimately how many different tools come together to work in a single project.
                </p>

                    What's next for XPosure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I choose to continue working on XPosure, I will hope to build upon the ideas that I currently have, such as creating more elaborate plans for its users to overcome their fears. In addition, I will hope to add more fear options while enhancing the quality to more closely simulate our current reality.
