                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students, we hated making works-cited text for our Language Arts projects. This app allows easy access to the Google Books database, and cites MLA in a very light-weight UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates MLA citations based on books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with Android, Java, and the Google Books API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was a major factor; this app was built in around 12 hours. Coordination within the team was tough too; it was tough to delegate different roles to other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within these 12 hours, we learned the basic Android UI, how to use the Google Books API, and how to cite with MLA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a basic UI, and use HTTP requests and JSON to grab data from Google Books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Librocite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A huge cleanup, and more features - including things besides books.
                </p>
