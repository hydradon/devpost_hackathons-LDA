                    My friend Jonah and I learned of ConUHacks some months ago, and never having participated in a hackathon before, we wanted to try it out. As a team of two hackathon beginners, we knew we wanted to create something small, manageable, but challenging nonetheless. We settled on this idea: to create a website to convert user-uploaded images to sound. I think that we did a pretty great job with the time that we had, as we were able to complete this central goal, and then some. We only stayed for about 12 hours of the full 24+, but it was a great learning experience!

                    We didn't use any company challenge APIs, and don't really expect to win any prizes, but the experience was the reward enough!
