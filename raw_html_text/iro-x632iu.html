                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    taking too long to get dressed every morning was a major inspiration :)
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Iro is a fully-functional android app that tells you whether 2 colors match together or not based on professionally made color palettes. The app would help people buy clothes with matching colors.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time developing for android, and our first time coding in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned programming for the android.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Iro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of enhancements that can be made for the app, e.g. adding more color palettes and supporting more than 2 colors at a time. I also plan to make iro a wearable with a color sensor.

                    <strong>
                        Fun fact: Iro means color in Japanese and is pronounce "eero"
                    </strong>
