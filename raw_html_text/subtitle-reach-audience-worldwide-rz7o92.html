                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am watching Twitch streamers almost everyday while i am doing something else (mostly programming). As i watch streams i realize that most of the time i either watch Turkish streamers (I am Turkish) or professional Korean esports players.Both of the side i realize that there is a language barier for them . For Turkish streamers , they only reach Turkish audience because they are speaking Turkish . For Korean esports players , viewers with different nationalities are watching them but they lost interest in stream very quickly due to language.So i start thinking how to solve this problem and i found a subtitle solution with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extension is basically subtitles for viewers.Yes! it is that easy .Viewers can read subtitles in 20 different languages.But image how big this solution can solve problems for community.
+Imagine you can understand Faker and master your skills in League of Legends.
+Imagine you are a streamer from Brazil but your viewers are from all over the worlds because they can understand you.
+Imagine you are laughing a Japanese joke as an American viewer
+Imagine you are getting subscribers from Germany as a Russian speaking streamer
... and many more
With the help of this extension you can actually removing all boundaries worldwide

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use Aws-Lambda as serverless backend with API Gateway to create a Http endpoint . I am also using AWS Translate's real-time translations in order to translate spoken language transcript into 20 different languages in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncing subtitles with the stream is the hardest thing i ran into but i explained it below how i solved it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is 1 technical and 1 general accomplishment that i'm proud of.
                    <strong>
                        Technical one is :
                    </strong>
                    Normally real-time translations requires at least 4-5 seconds in order to understand speech , converts to text and translates into different languages . However there is also a delay for live streams so i use that delay as cover for required time for subtitles .So at the end translations becomes almost synced with the stream
                    <strong>
                        General one is:
                    </strong>
                    I always want to watch Korean esports players and understand them.So with this extension it actually can happen so i am really proud of that.
