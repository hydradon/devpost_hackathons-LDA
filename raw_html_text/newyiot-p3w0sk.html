                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is driven by the idea of an IoT platform that is genuinely available for everyone. From school students experimenting with projects in the backyard, through to engineers designing the next innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an opportunity to activate IoT initiatives in Newcastle from edge-to-edge. Through our research, an Australian first, let alone a community first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    But why?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem 1 (Solved): Community-led IoT Education is hard to find/engage. The "IoT" movement, at its heart, is powered by the maker community. Everyday people, with great ideas that would like a way to "give it a go". Our project, NewyIoT, fully embraces this, provides clear and highly discoverable ways to find community educational events, while at the same time celebrating the creations that are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problem #2 (Solved): IoT infrastructure is expensive. For example, Newcastle City Council celebrated the commencement of a LoRaWAN network consisting of 6 Gateways for around $100K, yet only covering a small portion of Newcastle. Using open source hardware, software, maker initiative and a bit of grit, we've got the cost down to less than $150 per Gateway. Other costs would be involved, though we've developed an offering that is far more impressive, and offers edge-to-edge coverage (wouldn't it be great to see the difference put into community education initiatives!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problem #3 (Solved): While there is network coverage in Newcastle, there are
                    <em>
                        many
                    </em>
                    black-spots. Successful IoT initiatives work best with a platform that's available, everywhere. Without full coverage limits opportunities for students, tech enthusiasts and startups where IoT technology is intermittent or not available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NewyIoT is an initiative that is supported by a platform. It consists of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A dedicated website located at newyiot.com provides a focal point for IoT activities in the region, including community education events, news and statistics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ultra-low cost Gateways distributed around Newcastle that provide edge-to-edge LoRaWAN coverage for simple and reliable access to The Things Network (TTN). The only tech-dependency is an internet connection. If none is available, we have the option to use an LTE modem (which fits in the enclosure!).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "NewyIoT" initiative is highly discoverable and recognisable through simple yet effective branding on distributed hardware and social media.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gateway: As "makers", we've engaged the best of the open source resources for hardware choices. We're using a Gateway platform that supports full 8-Channel LoRaWAN functionality, modified and locked down a stable code stack and implemented mechanisms to remotely manage updates. We've engineered a hardware stack that has reliably performed when tested side-by-side with industry-grade equipment and has flexibility for different configurations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NewyIoT.com: built with Wix for ease of maintenance and proof of concept. The website is the "entry point" for the branding/tagline of the initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social activity. The hashtag #NewyIoT is proposed as the social tag for initiatives that relate to IoT activity in the region.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the software stack locked down &amp; sourcing hardware in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of how #NewyIoT is so usable for social activities. The tag #NewyIoT tied together with the website newyiot.com, along with clear/visible branding on all installed hardware, Newcastle City Council have a social platform that scales and has impressive growth potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were plenty of discoveries along the way, though I got to learn a fair bit more about LoRaWAN packet forwarders which was a refreshing hour-or-two!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NewyIoT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a production-grade enclosure. Go live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to see Gateways installed in these locations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At bus stops that have WiFi installed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the back of busses (this solves so many geo-issues for network coverage, and LoRaWAN works well with this style of mobile installation).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At schools (where there are no coverage points via busses etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Static locations wherever there is power, and Newcastle Council is supportive to do so.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And at the same time, engage community education leaders to promote and activate the usage of the city-wide IoT network.
