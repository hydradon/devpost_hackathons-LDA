                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier to navigate presentations. Handheld clickers are useful for going to the next and last slide, but they are unable to skip to specific slides in the presentation. Also, we wanted to make it easier to pull up additional information like maps, charts, and pictures during a presentation without breaking the visual continuity of the presentation. To do that, we added the ability to search for and pull up images using voice commands, without leaving the presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presentalk solves this problem with voice commands that allow you to  move forward and back, skip to specific slides and keywords, and go to specific images in your presentation using image recognition. 
Presentalk recognizes voice commands, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Goes forward one slide
                            </li>

                                Goes back one slide

                                Goes to the third slide

                                Goes to the first slide containing the string "APIs" in the title

                                For example, a teacher might realize they are missing a map or diagram from their presentation, and use the "Show me" command to pull up an example

                    We need to request microphone access through the browser, and use that as the audio stream. After that, we will be able to publish Presentalk as a website.
