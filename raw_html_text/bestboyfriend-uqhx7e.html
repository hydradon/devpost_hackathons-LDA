                    We wanted to create a safety tool that will allow women to share their contact information to men who are interested in them and at the same time provide education/orientation for men on respecting women's boundaries. Often, boys enter manhood without proper guidance on how to establish relationships with the opposite sex and in their awkwardness and misguidance from their peers are unknowingly creating an unsafe environment for women. In our development we leveraged social media to motivate men and women to establish dating rules at the beginning of their relationship.
