                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1989, Dragon Ball Z first aired on TV in Japan. From there onward, Dragon Ball Z has captured the hearts of many around the world &mdash; including ours. We decided to create a hack that would incorporate our love of Dragon Ball Z with virtual reality.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players are placed in an arena and must survive against the incoming 'enemies'. 
In the bottom-lefthand corner of the screen, the user is able to view their current health and energy. Users must charge up their energy in order to perform specialized moves. These moves are heavily inspired by those in Dragon Ball, including the iconic kamehameha, ki blast, and teleport. In order to perform these moves, users have to place their hands in certain positions &mdash; ones that represent the movements of characters on the show.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SurviVR was programmed and designed all using Unity. Our scripts were coded in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge the group faced was creating the motion control. There was no specific API that would assist the group with motion control, so we had to find a way to track our movements. We solved this by setting up colliders that would allow us to give us the general location of our hands, and calculated from those values. For more specific hand movements, we essentially used more math to solve the issue. 
Additionally, we were forced to start our project several hours late because we did not have all the adequate equipment. However, we sacrificed some hours of sleep to accommodate for the lost time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team spent a large portion of our time on special effects. We are proud of the way that we specialized each move with our graphics and sound. 
We are also proud of how we stayed up for longer than 24 hours to complete the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dragon Ball SurviVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming ideas for our project, we wanted to create a multiplayer fighter game where we used two headsets. However, while trying to implement this idea we found that there was a lack of support for multiple VR devices, and most libraries had support for multiple non-VR devices. Hopefully in the future we will be able to implement this idea and create a full Dragon Ball FighterZ VR experience.
