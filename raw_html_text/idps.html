                    The healthcare industry collects huge amounts of healthcare data which, unfortunately, are not "mined" to discover hidden information for effective decision making.
Discovery of hidden patterns and relationships often goes unexploited. 
Advanced data mining techniques can help remedy this situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Develop a prototype Intelligent Disease Prediction System (IDPS) using data mining techniques, namely, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Neural Network.
To assist doctors in diagnosing the patient by analyzing the symptoms entered by patient and thereby predicting the possible disease at early stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A  system which can predict the diseases based on the input symptoms provided by user and help mankind or society people to analyze and understand their health status. This will also provide remedy for calculated particular diseases. People can self-analyze their health state and can take precautions as per the results.
Practitioners / Doctors to analyze the health state of the patient and based on that the manual diagnosis of the disease can also be possible by using the disease prediction system.
The intelligent data mining technique to guess most accurate illness that could be associated with patient&rsquo;s symptoms and also suggests the nearby hospitals. So in case of an emergency patient can make use of this system to know their disease and then they can approach the doctor for further diagnosis.
