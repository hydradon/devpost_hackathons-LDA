                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four girls in college, we've encountered many uncomfortable experiences whether it was at a party that seemed too crazy or walking alone at night feeling like a target. To counteract all these issues, we decided we wanted to provide everyone (especially the LGBTQ, minorities, and womxn) a safe space where there's nothing to be feared.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a list of emergency contacts for our users, a quick emergency call function, user interaction through rating areas, parties, and events, warning users when entering a "Red Zone" (which are areas with known sex offenders), and "Go Zones" where it provides users with areas that are safe for LGBTQ, minorities, and womxn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Android Studio development platform to build the mobile app. We also created future mock-ups of our app using Canva and promoted our app idea by creating a domain called itsasafedomain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the syntax and trying to link the different Activities together. We also had trouble creating the call function to actually contact the numbers listed for emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Android Studio is such a short amount of time and also developing our first website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't just learn how to use Android Studio and web development, but I also learned that you can accomplish so much in just a short amount of time. It was super fun working with my group and seeing all our hard work turn into a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeSpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering user and public data to identify current safe spaces for users to start going to. Adding background information about harassment and assault into our app to educate our users. Verifying users to ensure that they are trustworthy.
