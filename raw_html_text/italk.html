                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Up to 50% of Americans are not adherent to medication, and this costs the healthcare industry $100 to 300 billion and also countless lives a year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app encourages patients to take medications as recommended by tackling the three most common causes of treatment non-adherence: forgetfulness, misperception, and costs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using user-centered thinking paired with a variety of computer-based languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were quite a number of solutions to the above medical issues, and it was a challenge to narrow down the focus into a few unique features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We kept our focus on the patient by tackling the more prevalent causes of non-adherence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds, industries, and disciplines within a limited time.
                </p>

                    What's next for iTake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see a lot of potential to apply advanced technologies such as AI and big data to this application. There are a number of ways to further streamline the collaboration among the various stakeholders of this project - including the patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies.
