                    The user must check off symptoms of the patient from a list of 271 symptoms.
Based on the user's selection of symptom(s), WebMD 2.0 will give a list of possible diagnoses, sorted from most probable to least likely.

                    Setting up, incompatible hardware, pre-planning, Java's inability to easily import external libraries, and splitting up tasks evenly.

                <p>
                    We got a working build of our project (big s/o to Ryan Walsh).
Successfully implemented APIMedic for our project.
Learning everything about Android Studio (GUI, IDE).
Thinking up a useful app that can potentially save lives.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java cannot easily import external libraries.
Java has its fair share of limitations.
Pre-planning before a big project is extremely important.
Version controlling is extremely useful once mastered.
Dividing up the work would have helped a lot.
Planning ahead on what environment we want is important.

                    Implement a classification tree. This will allow us to give faster and more accurate diagnoses. The user will first choose symptoms from a list of very simple, easily recognizable symptoms. Then, based on the chosen symptoms, the list of symptoms given will be specific and advanced (Think

                    </a>
                    ).
Implementing the app's ability to suggest simple, quick treatments that instruct the user on how they can relieve the patient's pain before the medics arrive.
