                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got to the hackathon late, but I wanted to do something somewhat related to sound. I wasn't really in the mood to try and find a team as the hackathon was just starting, so I decided to do a smaller project by myself, I ran into the folks at SEP, and they handed me a BoilerMakeBingo sheet, and one of the frameworks on the sheet was Minecraft Forge, and I thought a mod in minecraft that enhanced the sound would be something that I could solo hack together over the hackathon, so I decided to do that for my hackathon project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes sound in minecraft more realistic, implementing things like Occlusion, and Sound Attenuation. It's a step closer towards making my dream of 3d wave tracing for sounds in games possible, and while my project will only be extremely basic ray tracing, I hope that it's a significant step in reaching my dream of 3d wave tracing for sounds in video games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was written in java using the forge framework to create a modification that could be loaded with the forge launcher
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time coding a minecraft mod from scratch, and it was honestly a lot harder than I thought it would be. Had to learn a bunch of libraries on the fly, and I had to deal with and understand a bunch of complex mathematical operations, which really isn't my strong suit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monster Energy Drink is just a potion that converts lifespan into energy. Also that writing minecraft mods across different versions requires a lot of research and time, attempting to convert the mod to 1.12.1 from 1.12.2 took me an hour before I gave up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Minecraft Sound Physics Engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may work on it a little more in the future buy implementing more things that I learn about how sound waves travel. I eventually want to convert it to complete wave tracing instead of the baby ray tracing that I am currently doing, however that is very far off in the future.
