                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this app came from working with customers who are too hesitant to send text messages to a number to control their security system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows customers using a cellular enabled security system to have quick keys to Arm, Disarm, and Display the Status of their system with just a push of a button. In the back-end the app is simply sending and receiving the text messages from the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using the ionic framework along side Covora, integrating Javascript, Typescript, and HTML to build a multi-platform mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I ran into was learning a new framework above all else. Ionic is fairly easy to get the hang of, but starting from nothing, it was a bit of a trek to get started. Another big challenge is dealing with the SQLite data of storing and retrieving multiple systems.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I have a solid proof of concept that will atleast communicate the specified commands to the security system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this project, I learned mostly TypeScript as well as JavaScript. I have also learned how to use the Ionic Framework and API, as well as Cordova to build the application. I also brushed up on my database skills as well as my web development (HTML, CSS) skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Security Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for this project after the hackathon is to continue to improve and solidify the app. In the current state, I have a proof of concept, however it has not met all of my end goals, those being having the ability to intercept text messages from the inputted systems and show them as a notification from Security Control.
