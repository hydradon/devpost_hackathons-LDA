                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I have never had an Idea how agriculture climate works, what are the factors that are responsable about the quality of crops and things like that, But as I put my trust in the power of DATA SCIENCE, I believe that data science can solve the problems of agriculture, I first made a quick search about the commun problems that farmers are facing during the lifecycle of crops, I found that there are many problems including diseases, water managment, fertilizers  and so many other factors, I based my prototype on these last 3 things that I mentioned, to make an IOT system that sends data to a platform which is doing analysis to this data and give some results to the farmer in a mobile application that it will be easy to understand and make decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system will be based on sensors data and they will be connecting with each other and sending data captured to a centrelized database, then the work will start on the backend of the platform to prepare data and make analysis, predictions and probabilities, a data collection, transformation into information and then sharing it as a knowledge on visualisations on the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sensors data, collecting data and send it to a cloud or a centralized database using wifi, preparing data and making analysis using multiple ML algorithms, mainly predictive modelling and regression.
The platform has 3 major features:
1- Main Dashboard:
The dashboard contains statistics and state of your farm:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the state of weather, Temperature, Humidity and Wind
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the state of climate performance :
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Climate performance is being calculated using regression, based on previous data and previous crops and giving a pourcentage of the state.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Giving a range of Best and Worst climate performance degree during the last 24hr
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the state of Water (if it is enough or you should put more water to crops)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the probability of Weed or Disease that can affect crops.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Status of Fertilizers, are they enough, not or you added a lot and this may affect negativly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Crop Quality, Basically should be calculated based on climate and other stats
2- Automation Service
This Service contains Automation to some tasks for example:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automate watering for a specific time if the water status is under 50% and stop watering if its more than 90%
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This service can be assigned as a AIwatering, which does watering based on the crops quality, it tries to fit the climate and do it own watering to make the best Crops quality, (using genetic algorithm)
3- Notification &amp; Warnings Center
A service to notify the farmer if something not expected happens
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can like get warning if the water status or disease degree passed a number or gets below a degree.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have enough time to prepare a well done prototype using a ML model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of what I've done so far, Thinking about multiple usecases of something is not that easy, I tried to have a clear and non complicated idea, that can be implimented easily and doesnt cost alot to be applied.
I am also satisfied about the way I treat problems and use my passion which is data science in order to bring a brand new effective and innovative solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about IOT how it works how it is connected where do they send data and some valuable information during my search, also I have learned some Agriculture culture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IOF (Internet of Farms)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all I will see if the idea got good reviews from others, if yes I will try to make a small prototype and test it then if things goes well why not developing the idea more and turning it into real business.
