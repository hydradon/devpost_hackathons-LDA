                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empowering Women. We felt that the best way to empower women on the short term was to give them the right tools to make the wisest decision when traveling in an urban environment - especially college campuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides the user with tools that will allow to see the safest paths to any destination. The interactive map will show lit up streets (vs obscure ones), open public spaces (restaurants, stores, libraries...) and campus police cars on duty.
In case of uncomfortable situation while walking, a feature allows to alert or call an officer for him to drive by, escort back or help the individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Competition - many apps on the market, however they are not attractive or user-friendly and usually have low downloads. Hence there is space to develop other solutions.
Lighting database - have yet to find a way to supply this information, however, as the app will be targeted towards campuses at first, college and university authorities will be able to provide the safest routes for students and update them on the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea. We feel that not only does it empower women to stay and feel safe, it can also be used by anyone in urban environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How complex it is to come up with a unique solution and a truly helpful one for the community that women would actually want on their phones.
                </p>

                    Develop the application. Which will take about 2 weeks.
