                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from our personal experience of waking up early to go to school, only to find out that school was closed or buses were cancelled and we missed an opportunity to sleep in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application checks the twitter account of the Peel District School Board to determine whether school is closed or not. If the Peel twitter account makes a tweet saying so, then your alarm will be automatically turned off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to write the program, python-twitter to check the twitter account of PDSB, and a dragonboard to create the alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were being able to run python code on the dragonboard and installing the necessary packages to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we're proud of is being able to successfully connect the dragonboard and the python program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that how to use and install modules with pip install, as well as how to use the PUTTY command line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snow Day Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the alarm only works for students within the Peel School Board and we hope to expand this to other regions.
We also hope to improve the accuracy of determining whether the tweet indicates schools are closed or not.
