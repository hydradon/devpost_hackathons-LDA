                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too often are females underrepresented in the boardroom. While they can be physically present in meetings, but oftentimes they are talked over, ignored, or simply dismissed. Even worse, their male counterparts often take credit for their ideas, even though the ideas have been voiced earlier by females. This phenomenon can occur among all forms of meetings, from small informal meetings, to large structured meetings, such as senate hearings. Oftentimes organizations are not proactive enough to encourage female participation in meetings, and empowered women who do try to actively participate in meetings are ostracized and incur backlash. We are seeking to empower women in meetings, by helping organizations proactively encourage equal participation in meetings through providing data on meetings.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system of applications seeks to use machine-learning to analyze the meeting. Analysis includes voice recognition of whoever is speaking, and data from past meetings. The analysis illustrates the percentage of the meeting in which a specific person speaks, and builds a character profile of each person present in the meeting. The system can also be used to illustrate trends over time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS to build a web application/ UI interface. We then used Python to access Azure APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had formatting issues for the web UI, and the Azure API was difficult to use, due to poor documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to not only build a dynamic UI, but also managed to figure out the Azure API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make an effective UI, and how to make use of voice recognition APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Podium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking of expanding the machine-learning capabilities to revolutionize meetings; we are thinking of analyzing visual cues as well as audio cues, to provide further analysis.
