                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by all four of us losing our student IDs in our life, we decided to create an app that will revolutionize the way students will live. Enter StudentQR, a web app that is accessible anywhere and at any time, provided you have data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudentQR generates QR codes. But that's not all. That QR code is personal to you only and represents your student card. Long gone are the days where you fumble around in your less than stellar school app to search for your schedule to show your impatient friend. Now, with the click of a button, your friend can scan your QR code and get ALL, and we mean ALL, of your student information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With love and thoughtfulness, we built it from the ground up using HTML, JavaScript and a hint of CSS to make it pretty. The perfect recipe for a lovely and thoughtful app for all students to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying motivated and putting ideas together prived to be a challenging task we did not expect during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we loved working together on a project that we truly envision being implemented in the near future by school institutions for students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pouring our time and energy in a project we truly believed in takes a lot of expertise, patience and drive to pursue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudentQR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the software of course! Although the groundwork has been laid, we wish to continue this project and watch it bloom.
