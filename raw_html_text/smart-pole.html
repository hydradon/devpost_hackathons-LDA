                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love to drive cars. We like to do it in a calm, not-nervous way.

                    Smart Pole is an embedded system which can extend existing street poles. 
It has got a solar panel and a battery in order to charge itself.
It has got a simple movement sensor (e.g. microphone, laser, camera, ...) in order to detect vehicles.
It has got a wireless network chip (e.g. WiFi, radio, Bluetooth, ...) in order to communicate with near-by Smart Poles.
Optionally it is possible to get an extended version of Smart Pole which is able to exchange (send, receive) data with the Internet or external systems like autonomous drones, .... 
It has got a simple processor which identifies potential hazards, e.g.:

                    <li>
                        accidents due to stopped movements,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        oncoming vehicles - thinking about serpentines,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        external signals - think about oil on race tracks
It has got multi-colored LED in order to signal hazards.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long team discussions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arguments supporting our idea to compete, thus to integrate with oncoming big Car-2-X (Vehicle-2-Vehicle, Vehicle-2-Infrastructure) technologies.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is cheap, modular and extendable. The market introduction is fast and risk-less.

                <p>
                    This was our first Hackathon. We learned to think lateral.
