                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prospect of being able to help parents find their missing children is a topic we found very close to our hearts. It is a project we would be proud to assist with and hence we chose this topic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates an up to date database of information for your child. When the child actually goes missing then there is an ample source of up to date information on the child that can be distributed to both the public and the police at the click of a button to help with the search for the child
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML and Css to make forms and wix tools to combine them together, we have made a website that can keep the data for each parent and show the children who are entered.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lack of knowledge of PHP limited the uploading of files. Also, the lack of knowledge of javascript or css prior presented challenges to the team.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Learning how to use javascript and CSS in such a short amount of time was an experience and we are proud to have gained some basic proficiency in them
