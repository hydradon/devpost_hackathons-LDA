                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that when people watch a News or Tv show, they constantly want to know about the ideas of other people. Lot of people including me open Reddit, twitter, facebook and try to find that topic extensively and read it. I say instead stay relaxed and ask alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill basically provides you with the latest hashtags or trends. It gives you best trending hashtag suggestions and allows you to pick from those hash tags and listen to them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the Node.js, amazon dynamodb as backend data base and s3 bucket service to load the file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet is damn poor for my laptop all the day part of the competition. The result developed is done working all at night.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the root idea I started this skill to develop a vocal stream of hashtagging which would be revolutionizing the sales of kinds of AI like ALexa Google home. And also it will change the phase of advertising industry enabling lot of vocal ads in between Hashtags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got better at using alexa and dynamodB. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience in Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vocal Hashing!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanna improve this skill so that user can interface with alexa dynamically, not only listening but also posting threads to hashtags which I believe will sure be revolutionary.
