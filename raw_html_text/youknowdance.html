                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everybody knows dancing, we trained a human-pose-human network by implement pix2pix network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a dancer who knows dancing, you can generate a video that you dance in the same way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded Youtube dance videos and collected videos for ourselves. We first train a pix2pix network matching 2d pose extracted by openpose and RGB video on collected videos. Then dancing pose are extracted from dancer videos and apply on collected videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Network implementation and training was a issue due to huge computations. Then we decided to use Google Cloud Platform TPU to train it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YouKnowDance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to put it online and train with more data to get better performance.
