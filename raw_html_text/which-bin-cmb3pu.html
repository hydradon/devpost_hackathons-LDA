                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out what can and can't be recycled can be confusing. Different places may have their own rules about what can be recycled, making it hard to determine what items can be recycled and which bins they go in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we built Which Bin, an Alexa skill that helps you efficiently sort items into recycling, compost, and landfill bins.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Can I recycle this?" From coffee cups to less common items like bubble wrap, Which Bin tells you how to recycle it. It currently understands several items that students commonly throw away on campus, and we're expanding its ability based on real world usage
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recycling and composting services vary in different places, so Which Bin customizes its responses based on your device's location.
