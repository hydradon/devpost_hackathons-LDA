                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted a simple way to parse text, as recently I've been quite interested in Natural Language Processing(NLPs) and text parsing is one method
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsr parses text in a simple terminal window. It's minimal, clean and simple.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the open source Spacy library and Python.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Due to organization issues with my team I ended up building this project on my own in a few hours.
