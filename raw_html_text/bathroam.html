                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Created after a long debate of weighing what is practical, possible, and new. After a series of increasingly silly ideas, we came up with the idea of creating a useful tool that sources its data from its users in a novel and fun way.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Using a users location,t  shows all nearby bathrooms in a radius. It also allows users to add bathrooms to the map. We have a point system in place that will allow users to compete for things like the most bathrooms visited and discovered.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The python library Django was used to build the server and and all the handling of the database. Java and Android Studio were used to design a user interface.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Android Studio is pretty difficult to use, especially when it's your first time. While we have the backend built and many tests for all the API endpoints, we were't able to get the frontend to actually communicate, and it will be running on sample data to display the possibilities of the system.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We built a mostly functional user interface in a not-so-intuitive system that none of us had ever used before, and we built a backend with a database complete with tests to make sure all of the methods actually worked.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We got valuable experience with both Android Studio, Java, XML, and Django. We learned all about the fun math that goes into crunching GPS coordinates, and we put more thought into bathrooms than we ever thought we would in our lives.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BathRoam
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>A large amount of work that was originally planned was unable to make it into the project, such as rating a bathroom, up-voting or down-voting based on if a bathroom actually exists, and using the upvotes or downvotes to remove a bathroom if majority say it does not exist. Possible thoughts are implementing a point system that users could use to maybe get achievements or cosmetics, to make the system into less of a tool and more of a competitive game.
