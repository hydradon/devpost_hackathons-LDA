                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I frequently need to go to the restroom during sporting events (and movies, and theater productions, etc...) but don't like waiting in lines during chaotic high-traffic time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it is supposed to do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing a webcam and image processing, the app tracks foot traffic and changes the status of the some of the marked bathroom locations on a web application map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't complete it, but the intention was to write images from a webcam stream to a filesystem temporarily and use OpenCV to do image processing on photos to determine the foot traffic during a period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some significant issues configuring my primary image processing tool (OpenCV) with the Python Virtual Environment and it ate up a lot of time...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks sorta pretty, but is essentially in the "wire frame stage". AND I got to participate in my first Hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about what to have prepared for my next Hackathon!

                    What's next for peeti.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to flesh out the image processing application quite a bit more.
