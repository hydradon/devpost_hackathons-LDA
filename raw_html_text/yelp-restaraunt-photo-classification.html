                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the progression of technology and how yelp is able to classify photos into 9 different labels. I was wondering if I could apply this to restaurant names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a user input of an image and location, it will return the predicted name and the query for more information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Tensorflow, Docker, Inception v3, Yelp Api, AWS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges I ran into was that I had too many categories. This drastically reduced my training because I didn't train much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get a working prototype in the time I had and was able to learn more about the process of creating a "python package".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about CNN's and their uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Train the Inception classifier from scratch (this would take weeks!!!) instead of just retraining the final layer and modifying the weights. Also, I need to be able to capture the results automatically from the c++ program (in the tensorflow library) and use it in my python program.
