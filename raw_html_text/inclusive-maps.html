                    Our story
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Danger in public spaces is a real and constant problem for transgender people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During social outings or when the need for a doctor arises, the thought is always "will I be harassed or treated unfairly".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This constant fear of the unknown can be crippling to some trans people and others in the LGBT community. However, the need for better information on inclusive spaces still goes unfulfilled, with current solutions suffering from poor UI/UX.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we tackle this issue
                </h1>
                <p>
                    With SDG 11 in mind, our team built
                    <strong>
                        Inclusive Maps~
                    </strong>
                    , a responsive web application that uses crowd sourced information to help members of the LGBT community feel more safe and comfortable, and for their allies to make better decisions on where to take their business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Inclusive Maps
                    </strong>
                    not only reduces one of the most common pain points for the LGBT community, but also lays down the ground work for social change by increasing the availability of this critical information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Highlights inclusive healthcare providers, schools, and bathrooms that serve Transgender or gender-non conforming people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Allows inclusive rating for any other locations on Google Maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Shows the inclusive or un-inclusive nature of a neighborhood or city by highlighting positive and negative experiences.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    1) We talked to people who identified as trans and compiled the pain points of their daily experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We looked at current solutions and analyzed why it works and why it ultimately falls short.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Through the above research, we narrowed down our scope to focus on the 3 major categories of pain points:
                    <strong>
                        Medical Services
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        Bathrooms
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        Educational Facilities
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) With the goal of crowd sourced reviews, we aimed for a responsive web application that is easily accessible on computers and phones -- the primary places of usage for this app.
