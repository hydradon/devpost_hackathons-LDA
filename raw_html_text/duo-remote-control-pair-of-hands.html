                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A remote control pair of hands can be powerful in many fields.  For example, it can be used for remote surgeries in rural areas, in space to repair parts without a manned mission, or in dangerous tasks such as underwater welding.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Duo mimics both left and right arms in real time using Leap Motion, node.js, and an Arduino Mega.  In addition, a first-person perspective of the arms can be seen through a webcam connected to a VR headset.  The webcam is capable of moving in two axes to point in the direction of the VR headset.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two modified open-source robotic arms were 3D printed.  Servo motors were connected to an Arduino Mega.  An inverse kinematics algorithm was coded in Node.js.  Leap motion was integrated in Node.js.  A webcam was fastened to two servo motors to allow first-person perspective.  Much troubleshooting was needed.
