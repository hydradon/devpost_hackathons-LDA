                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that after events people don't get a proper place to talk about and learn after the event. So there must be a place where people from different domains can come to a single place with different corners and can learn there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing fancy, you can say it to be just another forum but it depends on how we use it and it is being moderated. A lot of forums work on this model. sadly, we don't have a centralized forum like this in our developer community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used open source framework myBB and installed it. Our main focus is on how we use it rather than what functionality it does have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is so hard to work when you are in a full-time job. We both were having time constraints. It was hard deciding all the things we need to keep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking that we won't be able to make a submission but whatever happens, atleast we are submitting it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to work in teams and how things should be planned before and their backups too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dev Circles Community
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, we will be making better things as not very much satisfied with our product right now.
