                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the terminator movie. Because it has robots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It throws projectiles at a reasonable distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using arduino and java, and a bit of tears and suffering. Along with our custom made 3D printer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fatigue, and learning new things that we have never learned in class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to implement serial communication between java and arduino, made a GUI to control to parameters of the throwing motion, printed and built the throwing arm during the competition and we made the stepper motor move using the arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that serial communication is finicky, time is much needed for big projects. We all tackled new challenges during the hackathon.
                </p>

                    Not much actually.
