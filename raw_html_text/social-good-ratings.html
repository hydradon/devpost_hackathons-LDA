                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blind consumerism is an underrated problem in today's increasingly brand-obsessed society. Both of us having grown up in Indonesia, the harsh realities of factory worker conditions and underpayment was never unfamiliar to us, and has led us to grow very wary of the brands we spend our money on. Despite this, however, we find it very alarming how little of us really take the time to stop and think about which initiatives or practices we are really supporting as we make our purchase from a brand - and even when we do, information is biased and convoluted - it requires more than an elaborate google search to fully demystify the process of what really goes on behind these companies - time that a lot of us would rather spend doing other things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why we built our chrome extension. When oftentimes companies and distributors would rather keep their unethical practices hidden, we wanted to make sure that this information was as transparent and as conveniently as possible; We want to make people realize that shopping is more than sorting by product price or by popularity without being overly intrusive to their shopping habits, but also supporting causes that matter to them and to the world, all the while rewarding and empowering these companies for their initiatives for social and environmental responsibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chrome extension runs in the background as they browse on any other shopping site such as Amazon while keeping the interface they are used to, and adds an extra field which indicates a 'Social Good Rating', which is a heuristic generated from an algorithm that involves the combination of running Google's Sentiment Analysis / Natural Language Processing API on the company's Wikipedia and customer reviews page, as well as counting the ratio of the frequency of words and phrases related to social good relative to the rest of the text. When the cursor clicks on / hovers above this 'Social Good' rating, the extension will also display which of these words and phrases the company seemed to be most strongly associated with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into and What's Next for Social Good Ratings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right data to extract unbiased information was one of the hardest aspects of this project. Although we were able to make do with the best option currently available, there are still many limitations to using this, such as leaving our smaller companies which do not yet have a Wikipedia page or their own website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we realized we could leverage this fact to show how serious this lack of information really was, and decided to still display companies we did not have information for, in hopes we will inspire curious people to take their own time to explore these company's mission, vision, and practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we aim to add another feature which not only displays these Social Good ratings by each product, but also enables customers to sort the Catalog with them, in addition to the usual price and popularity fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, by having the public realize how much a lot of people are in the dark about these issues (even with the internet), we hope to increase awareness and inspire people to contribute to building our own database which will dedicated to increasing awareness on corporate responsibility and sustainability, which not only will be useful to further develop our chrome extension, but also will be the go-to for any shoppers curious about what they're really spending on by buying any brand.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built with JavaScript, Python 3.7, Google Cloud Features such as Google Cloud Natural Language Processing / Sentiment Analysis APIs and Cloud Functions and Shell.
