                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between being full time engineering students and athletes, there is often not enough time to make sure our daily hydration goals are met. After discussing with many of our peers, there were very few who actively consumed the right amount of water per day. Additionally, many students have a difficult time knowing how hydrated they are and how much water we should be drinking on a given day. We decided to design a water bottle with notifications to help achieve that goal without being too intrusive, like so many apps are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water consumption throughout the day. We are using an accelerometer to determine when the system is still and ideal for taking an ultrasonic reading. We have attached a capacitive touch button which has two functionalities. Upon a single press, a rgb led will flash on a scale from red to green depending on how hydrated you are for that 24 hour period. Upon a long single press, the data will be transfered from the onboard solution to our phone application, where data is analyzed, tips are given, and useful information can be viewed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a 3d printer to design the casing, low level sensors to take readings, and xcode to analyze and display the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Hardware integration
2) iOS barrier of entry
3) Computer problems
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1)Small form factor
2)High level of hardware integration
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) value of diversity of majors on team
2) iOS programming
3) arduino
4) adapting to new environment 
5) speed prototyping and testing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Droplet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we need to test our design and code more thoroughly since there are corner cases that our system cannot currently handle. We would also like to bring down the cost of our system so that the product can be viable for our business model.
