                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many professional traders are reluctant to trade on decentralized exchanges because private key management is an extremely risky and unsolved problem. If you deploy your private key to a production or test environment and it gets owned, you can lose hundreds of thousands or even millions of $.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve this, we can build a smart contract that is able to generate orders and take orders, but can only withdraw to a pre-set account. This smart contract can be freely used in production, as the only thing risk is that someone steals a key and can generate a 0x order.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users who deploy FundsAreSafu (TCS) register a number of addresses they want to be able to use to sign orders
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When someone attempts to fill one of those orders, FundsAreSafu will verify that the signature is legit and belongs to an authorized address
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can also fill an outstanding order by sending it through the smart contract
                    </li>
                </ul>
