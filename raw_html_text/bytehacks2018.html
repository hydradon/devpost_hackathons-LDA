                    First hackathon project
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hackathon we tried to tackle the Best Hack for Disaster Relief &amp; Recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Background of challenges:
"Think about how technology can be used to aid cities impacted by natural disasters with relief and recovery. You can build off of one of the existing ideas already in the disaster relief technology landscape or come up with new ideas that address gaps in this space. You
can also consider one of the themes/questions below. "
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team chose: 
"How do we update impacted the community about the status of roadways and areas near their homes so they know if it is safe to return post-evacuation? " and "How do we better prepare communities and communicate with them when there is an impending natural disaster? "
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have five advantages over other current alerts system:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Allow people to ask for professional help through texts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow people to plan their routes to obtain customized emergency notifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow people to receive specific notifications by setting preferred ratings of the emergency that they want to receive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow people to report an emergency as a victim or a witness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow users to chat with people nearby to ask for help or warn for others.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This is a three-part project which we worked equal parts in but could not finish in its entirety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here lays the outline of our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A website with our company name "MishApps" which is an online community forum and hotline. The website's purpose is to help find local aid in any situation, whether it be a natural disaster or local accident. Our homepage displays a form for your zip code so we can find where the user is and let them know of any disasters near them. These disasters can be shootings, car accidents, environmental factors and much more.
If a user needs immediate help, there is a phone form in which they may text MishApps directly or speak to us. As we get familiar with the situation we will either send our own first responders or local police force/medical aid. MishApps main goal is to communicate efficiently during times of crisis. We want to be able to speak for our users if they cannot speak and provide the best system of recovery or aid whenever needed. Users will also have the option to join an online community of volunteer first responders. Whether you report incidents or stop incidents,
users may submit a form describing the incidents that have happened. For instance, if there had been a shooting at a local park. Users may fill out a form and our system will generate a point system. If enough users report the same incident we will send a mass text to notify others. The company is versatile in how much help they can provide for the present and future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MissApps communicates through a website, app, and SMS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project mainly used HTML and CSS for the website. Python scripts and Twilio API's to run SMS apps.
