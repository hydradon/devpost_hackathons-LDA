                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, there are many youtube videos on fitness but there is no one to correct the person learning from the video if they make any incorrect move. It is usually a one-way communication. This leads to many injuries especially for beginners and it is also one of the deterring factors among people who want to learn a new fitness regime. Also, as a fitness expert, your outreach is often limited due to language limitations and distance. There are many yoga teachers in India who are among the best but their spoken language is Hindi which becomes a language barrier for people in the west. We envision a healthy society where any fitness expert can teach anyone without the barriers of language and distance with AI-powered application. Idea was to build an application that can bring such fitness experts to your home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built an AI-powered fitness application. It will correct your posture if you make a wrong move while learning from the fitness expert in the video. It will translate the video in your native language so that each and every instruction is crystal clear. Thus, having a personal trainer at your disposal.
The application offers a list of fitness programs and their experts. A student gets to choose a program and a language of their choice. Each program has a set of lessons before you get a completion certificate. Each lesson has a video of the expert where he/she will teach an exercise/asana. Each video will be divided into steps so that it is easy for the student to follow. After each step, the student will be given some time to imitate the steps shown by the instructor. AI pose detector will closely monitor the moves of the student and correct the student if they have incorrect posture. It will try to match the student&rsquo;s posture with the instructor and give you a thumbs up if you do it correctly.
