                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of foodies that loves to eat out, but as college students we do not have that luxury to eat out all the time. Eating out is bad for our wallet and promotes bad health, cooking for ourselves is the best option to save money and be healthy. Problem 1 we do not know how to cook. We want to make a cooking simulator to teach ourselves and others to cook!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a virtual reality cooking simulator that teaches players how to cook easy and healthy recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Easy Chef using Unity3D as the game engine, Blender and Maya for 3D modeling, and Visual Studio Code for scripting in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic interactions with the Vive controllers and game objects, such as picking up objects and opening a door. We removed the default Vive model with our own, which causes problems with the VRTK library we were using for interactions. In the end, we decided to keep the default models due to time restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an interactive virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different libraries and APIs, learning to code Unity with C#, learning how to use sensor for the controllers/VIVE, and different techniques for visual 3D modeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Easy Chef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve our visuals and graphical user interface for Easy Chef. We want the users to have more utensils and kitchen tools to use, different difficulty for each recipe, more interactions with the kitchen such as the fridge, sink, etc., and more recipes on the menu to learn.
                </p>
