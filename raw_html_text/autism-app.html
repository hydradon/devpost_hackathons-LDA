                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the current month of April which is dedicated to Autism awareness.  We created this app as an opportunity to raise Autism Awareness, draw attention to thousands of people who have autism and we want families with autistic kids to know that we care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this app is to help parents of children with autism, while also improving the lives of the children themselves in their day to day life. This mobile application is under one account but is separated into two different categories, one is for the patient, and one for the parents. The parents will have to set up an account for themselves and for the kids as well. 
For the patient side, children with autism can learn new vocabulary words by taking pictures on the app, which will then give an analysis of the picture. Children with autism tend to have high levels of anxiety, and this app can allow them to talk to a chatbot to decrease feelings of anxiety, improve their communication with family, and better express their feelings.
With the parents&rsquo; account, this app can allow parents to keep track of their child&rsquo;s location. This app will also allow parents to monitor the heart rate and motion of the patient using Fitbit to detect if their children have an anxiety/panic attack. Parents will also be able to create a schedule for their child to follow by sending alerts to the children&rsquo;s account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ionic Framework to create a mobile app.
Fitbit to monitor heart rate, motion, and location.
Azure Web App to deploy our server.
Azure Text Analysis to analyze the tone of text or speech of the patient, whether it&rsquo;s positive or negative.
Azure Computer Vision to give a description of the picture that the patient takes.
Azure bot framework along with language understanding from LUIS.ai 
Azure Maps to display the patient location to the caregiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues working with Microsoft Azure such as using the same resource groups. Not all of us were familiar with ionic so we had to familiarize ourselves with the framework within this short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we managed to add functionality to the app even though we had a lot of trouble with Microsoft Azure. We did not give up and went through with our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to be patient with our codes
We learned how to work with people who have different backgrounds and experiences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Autism app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more features to the apps, such as a game where children with autism can match words to a picture which will further improve their vocabulary. We would also like to improve the chatbot by providing more detailed responses.
