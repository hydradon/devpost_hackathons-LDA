                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parking at UMBC has been a hot commodity for every commuter. In order to help ease the problem and help people get to their classes on time, we decided to design a way for commuters to help each other out and get people into spots faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "parking, plz!!!" allows users to see a list of all submitted "empty" parking spots, add "empty" parking spots", and remove "empty" spots that become taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS/Express to setup a basic web-server that allows users to interface and use the add/remove capabilities. All of the backend information is done with JavaScript and utilizes an SQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to get the Express server created was the first issue since it was fairly new technology for us. Similarly, implementing the database on the back-end gave us trouble as we had to create full API routes to interface with the database and ran into syntax/language issues that came from inexperience with JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was mostly our first times ever using JavaScript, Express, and everything involved, and creating web apps. We made it through all of the basic features we wanted to implement and were able to overcome a lot of issues we ran into that were caused by inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of valuable skills related to web development. We all got a good introduction to JavaScript, CSS, HTML/PUG, and a refresher on SQLite3. We also had to learn how to use Google's cloud service to deploy which was new for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for parking, plz!!!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have a few features we want to implement, and of course some bugs to work out. We'd like to continue this project to make it a fully fledged online app where people can actually start using it!
