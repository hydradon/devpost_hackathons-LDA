                    A mobile application project that got its official start at PennApps XIII for the sake of well...better dating!
Tired of thinking about exactly where you will meet up with your date? 
Hate that awkward moment of who should grab the bill first? 
Afraid of how much you are allowed to order? 
Well have no fear, this app will wash those worries away.

                    Bon AppeMeet! matches people based on their food preferences and diet!Already one common thing between you are your date! 
In addition to that, it will match you and your date based on what restaurant and times you chose to go for the meet up. 
And not only that, it will match you and your date based on your interests so you two have something to at least talk about. 
Venue? Check! 
Time? Check! 
Topics to talk about? Check! 
But who pays the bill?! 
Have no fear! Right before you officially approve the meetup, you and your potential date have the option to offer to pay for 
the whole meal and if no one checks it off, then that means that you just have to pay for your own!

                    Basically, this app plans everything out for your meet-up, all you just have to do is get there! :)
