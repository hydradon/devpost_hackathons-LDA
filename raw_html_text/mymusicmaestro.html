                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many underfunded schools neglect their arts programs, causing students to miss out on key music developmental skills.  Our app strives to create educational equality by teaching children the basics of music theory.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Music Maestro plays a note and shows the note on a staff, encouraging kids to associate certain notes and learn their names.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java and Android Studio, we created an interactive App that combines elements of OOP and the media capabilities of Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio can be difficult to use, especially with little background experience.  However, our mentor guided us through the process.  One of our most challenging dilemmas was connecting our sound bytes to the actual code and getting it to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud of finishing our app and creating something that could be beneficial to students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and applying the skills the learned in class to a real-world situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyMusicMaestro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can expand on the musical capabilities by including flats, sharps, and also including the bass clef.  We also plan on creating multiple rounds and maybe even including an interactive piano so that kids can learn how to play the piano as well.
