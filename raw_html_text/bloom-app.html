                    Bloom is a social networking application aimed at forging new and instantaneous friendships between strangers who share similar
interests. Upon startup, the user is asked to input their major interests. Afterward, the user is then asked five targeted questions that is aimed at matching the user to other people who have similar responses within a given area.

                <p>
                    Bloom sends the user's location to a central server, and then matches the user to others within a given radius around them who have similar interests. After the match, Bloom then recieves the matched person's location from the server. Bloom then generates
a pulsating blue light, whose intensity and size is proportional to how close the matched person is near to them. Thus, the goal of Bloom is to gently guide the user into talking to new people at large conferences, orientations, universities, etc., in the hope of finding their matched friend. However, by providing only a distance to their match, Bloom drives the user to talk to other strangers in the hope of creating spontaneous friendships.
                </p>

                    Bloom was created at Big Red Hacks 2015 at Cornell University by a team of 4 Cornell students: Han Li, Jimmy Stoyell, Mark Zhao, and Jesse Lupica.
