                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to eat healthier and am constantly thinking about and adding up what meals to eat when I am home from meals that I like to cook. When traveling and not at home it can be harder to find the type of meal that would fit a diet so this site can help try to find a meal. For example, if a person is working out more and would like to maximize the amount of protein in a 500 calorie meal of the restaurants around them then this site would calculate and find the best meal.

                    The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

                    This site uses calories as the total weight, meal macros (Protein, Fat, Carbs) as the value and calories to calculate which meals would meet the calorie requirements.

                    Currently, the best choice meal is displayed only for the current location of this hackathon. I would like to set up a backend that can take local restaurants, find meals and then calculate the best meal and return it back to the front end. I would also like to add options to fine-tune options for sodium and other options.
