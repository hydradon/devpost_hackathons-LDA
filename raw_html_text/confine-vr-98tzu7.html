                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recently started doing a lot of escape rooms as a team and we wanted to make one for the Vive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that a lot of escape rooms lacked a sense of horror and so we wanted to make our project feel paranormal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unreal 4's visual programming language called Blueprints, we gave the player the feeling of going gradually insane in a horrific way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time our team developed for the Vive so working with that beast was a real challenge. Also, only having three days to complete our objective didn't make it easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on our team took on a wide variety of responsibilities that were out of our comfort zone, but we are very proud of the overall creepiness that our experience delivers and the feedback has been very positive thus far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to setup a VR demo and in many cases we learned what practices were best when it comes to optimizing a project for VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Confine VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to use it as a showcase piece for our company that we are trying to get off the ground. Confine VR's purpose is to show the world that Last Call Games (our studio) can do VR incredibly well.
