                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from a data science background, we have always enjoyed exploring data and coming up with different ways to analyse it. So we decided to use the Wegmans API to make something cool out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So a user would click a picture using our React-Native app of any food item he or she wants. The app would tell which food item it is and in which store of wegmans its located along with its name and price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to use the app in all mobile platforms. We have used Vision API from GCP to detect objects in the pictures.
                </p>
