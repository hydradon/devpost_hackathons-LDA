                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game started this weekend after brainstorming how to use finger tap controllers in virtual reality. The whole team loves music, and feels nostalgic about classic rhythm based games like Guitar Hero, so a fully immersive version was an obvious choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player picks up the custom built guitar controller and the finger trackers, and then taps their fingers in sync with the colored dots that flow down their heads up display. In addition to playing, they also need to dance around to match their guitar's location and rotation to a phantom guide. As they hit notes correctly, the venue gets more crowded and the audience starts dancing faster and faster. If they miss too many notes, the audience leaves and the game is over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a custom import for the knuckle controllers to be used as a controller in Unity, recorded our own music, build the whole environment without use of paid assets, built a custom guitar controller that works with the HTC Vive, and coded all the logic that makes the game work as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking with the Vive was a huge challenge, as well as getting the knuckle controllers into Unity since their API was not sufficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of how many custom things we built in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to budget our time, work according to our individual strengths, and that maybe a more simple project would have been more manageable :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mega Bass Boi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will live on in infamy! Beyond that, we have no current plans.
