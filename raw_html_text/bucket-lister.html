                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been having interesting weekends lately and it would be cool to see it on a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever you take a picture with the app, it records on the map where you took the picture and a little note
that way you get to see all the places you've been and where you have left to explore. The pictures get uploaded to the cloud with AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of it was done in android studio
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Database stuff is hard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Having something to submit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android activities and views are much clearer now
                </p>
