                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to take on the task of attempting to show to others what people living with Schizophrenia have to deal with daily. We hoped that we would be able to show the dangers of living with Schizophrenia and how hallucinations can come out when they're least expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simulator where you experience various hallucinations that real patients of Schizophrenia have reportedly experienced themselves. Just follow the instructions the instructions on the side.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Unity and the help of the Asset Store.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a long time to get everything working to an acceptable degree. There was a lot of stuff we wanted to put in, but we did not have the time or resources to carry out our full vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works. Somewhat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got more familiar with Unity's workings, while my teammate reinforced what he already knew how to do. We also learned about the daily struggles of those living with Schizophrenia and how even staying in a brightly lit area surrounded by friends isn't enough to keep them completely safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Skits
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have a more player friendly version of the simulator/game where the player is better aware of what they need to do and the game is laid out a bit better.
