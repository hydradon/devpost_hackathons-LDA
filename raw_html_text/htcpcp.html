                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The standards for Hypertext Coffee Pot Control Protocol were published as RFC 2324 as an April Fools' joke in 1998. It was an extension of HTTP that allowed for 'controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots.' We chose to take the old joke leagues too far and actually implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've developed client and server libraries in C that allow users to build applications using HTCPCP. The server library allows you to define routes and callback functions and run them as an HTCPCP webserver, and the client library builds requests that the server can receive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Purely using sockets in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did everything in C, what challenge
                    <em>
                        didn't
                    </em>
                    we run into?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's working! The client library can send HTCPCP requests and the server can receive them.
                </p>
