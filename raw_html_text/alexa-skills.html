                    We are both beginner's to both programming and computer science and wanted to test our skills by learning something new. Since we are studying Java in our CS111 class, we decided to learn some JavaScript (specifically node.js) so that we could work with and develop Amazon Alexa skills. We attempted more difficult challenges, but due to our limited knowledge, we decided to hack something more easily accessible. We decided to have fun with the project, which led to our creation of the Donald Trump Tweet skill, something that we both found very funny. Overall, this was a very good learning experience, and we both feel much more comfortable tackling new information and software/development challenges going forward.
