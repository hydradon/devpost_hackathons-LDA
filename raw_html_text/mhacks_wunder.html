                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are sometimes stopped their traveling plan by the overwhelming, unorganized data when they hit on the 'Google' button. Planes tickets, Visa issues, hotel booking, etc., and including planning ahead the entire itinerary could be scary and very time-consuming for guys who have a busy life and just want to chill for a few days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BUT! Their might be some travelers have been to the same places, during similar traveling season, who might have similar problems and concerns when they planned the trip; and they have the actual memory and experiences from the places that can be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if some busy (//lazy) guy who only has a rough idea of when to go, where to go, either wanna have a fast-paced exploration trip or slow &amp; easy lying on a beach, when he (she) hits on the search button, a customized itinerary plan can be displayed right on the screen?
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We defined a a few components that are necessary to describe a travel experience. Then we defined a few variables in a traveler's user profile that might affect what kind of people would be interested in his trips. Along with all those data structure, we defined the methods and operations that we are going to use in our system. Then we programmed the data structure and classes using python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we start building our back end server. We let our server dispatch some very simple front-end pages (only a few input field or simple combination of text and images). We carefully worked around the communication between the server and the front end input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we do the testing by either running local testing scripts or putting sample inputs from the front end. We figured out several bugs and come to this final version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is definitely the communication between the back end server and the front end input. We took several hours looking for missing data and that's horrible.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    We are so proud that two of us have done this during 36 hours period, but we are too tired to type it out :(
