                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to bring the magic and power of card games to reality, well virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A player wears an Oculus Rift and sits in front of a Kinect camera. Meanwhile, they are a god inside their headset, sitting inside the roman pantheon and selecting from any number of spells to cast. They can throw meteors or conjure up mountains- it is their task to hold off a wave of terrible minions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to network 2 DK2s together, allowing for players to battle each other over the network. Getting the two instances of the pantheon synced (including the other gods head/hand/and card positions) proved difficult and we decided to make it a 1-player adventure because of this.
                </p>

                    A great, granular controller for casting spells in space.
