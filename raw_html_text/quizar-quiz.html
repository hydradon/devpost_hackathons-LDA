                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game that would make learning more fun, my teammate suggested tower defense as the base of the game, and had the education part be based on flash cards as lots of students find that flash cards are the best way to study.
                </p>

                    Quasar Quiz is a educational game that encourages high school students to use flash cards. Flash cards have been widely accepted as one of the best studying techniques, yet common complaints include inability to properly create them, being mundane, and time consuming. The game is similar to tower-defense where the player has to defend Keplar-22b from multiple waves of enemies. If you answer one of the questions incorrectly, the upcoming levels will become more difficult.
