                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Singing in tune is hard. I personally can't sing very well.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an audio processing algorithm to detect and identify the frequency of tones. This is then utilized to play a game in which it displays the pitch you are singing in realtime as notes scroll across the screen and you have to sing in tune to score points.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an open source android guitar tuner and utilized the algorithms it used by turning it into a library and using as a dependency in our android studio project. We then worked on the menu and wrote the code for the basic game loop, graphics, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble learning android studio, formatting with the XML files, and turning the android guitar tuner project into a library usable by android studio.
                </p>
