                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going out and having a few drinks one night, I came home and wondered what my blood alcohol content was. There were some resources online that I could use to manually enter my information, but I wanted something I could easily interact with using my voice. Thus, I had the idea to create an Alexa skill that would do just that: estimate your BAC with just a few simple questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By asking for your gender, weight, how many drinks you've had, and how long you've been drinking, the Alexa skill uses the Widmark formula to calculate an estimate for one's blood alcohol content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa as the I/O device, which means we used their developer console to create the front-end experience. For the back-end, we created an Amazon Lambda function with Python 3.6 as our language of choice to handle all of the requests from Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactive session of this Alexa skill was something our team had never dealt with before. It took some learning and enduring to get past this challenge and create the final product.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the skill as a whole! It is a tangible product that we hope to continue to develop and publish to the Amazon Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacking together niche, interesting ideas in a short amount of time is fun, challenging, and an awesome experience when you have a great team.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alexa BAC Estimator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to polish the skill. Furthermore, we look to add functionality that can possibly link with the Uber skill to call an Uber for the user when the user is not in the right state of mind to drive. We believe this is a practical app that can better the world, and we strive to continue to add functionality that will do exactly that.
