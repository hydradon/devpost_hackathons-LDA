                    As students, whether we are college students or high schoolers, we get stressed. Everyone is from somewhere different, and to each of us we carry our own situations. Most students do not have access to a therapist 24/7 or have an available friend 24/7. It may also be that some people have difficulty trusting other people with their issues, or simply don't want to put their problems on someone else. With the TherapiBot, that changes. Its purpose is to act as an entry level destresser for students that are in a rough spot in their current lives. Not many students have access to a therapist, or simply may carry difficulty trusting other people with their problems. TherapiBot maintains the same confidentiality with a person, and attempts to help out the person in whatever way it is available.

                    The way I built it... I used python v3.7.4. The process was long, since I had to see what libraries I would use. This is also where I came across my first difficulty. I had a plethora of ideas, but attempting to find libraries to satisfy my needs was easier said than done. I couldn't find any. So i ended up modifying my original idea. I ended up using os and web browser libraries. Everything was set up, and I finally went through programming. I had many tedious errors while coding. In example, in some if statements I couldn't put more than one value to test or it would skip the else of elif statement completely! So I had to improvise throughout the code. Another big issue I ran into was the user input when I'm asking the user to vent. Since python naturally uses the enter key to move to the next part of the code, and not create a new line, I couldn't make it like a journal entry. I spent many hours attempting to find a way to store multiple lines of input into one input without overlapping/overriding. I finally made a mini-function that did this exactly. After this, coding the project went by smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have too many accomplishments for this, but I value my hard work for the project. What I'm proud of is that mini-function to create multiple lines of input then later store into one variable. I'm also happy that I was able to build a "simulation" of how a computer/human interaction could be through basic coding, especially since this could help many people suffering from daily mental health problems.
                </p>

                    I learned many new techniques for python, as well as new libraries to use that will come of use later in future projects. I also have a very basic outline for making python projects involving computer/human interaction.

                    What's next for this project? Originally, I had in mind to use this to help some of my close friends with their current struggles in college. Who knows? Maybe I can export it for mobile soon, and make this into a full-fledged app that can help many students.
