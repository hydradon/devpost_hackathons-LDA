                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As HCI students, we were excited to see a design challenge at Technica this year. The problem statement was open-ended and relatable. As students, we often don't learn much about money management and investments. But learning them early on helps us make good financial decisions. The importance of learning about money and investments is what motivated us to pursue this challenge.

                    InvestIn is a mobile app that educates young adults about investments and motivates them to set and follow their financial goals. It combines documentation of knowledge in the FinTech sector along with the social features that Millenials can use to learn about investments, get guidance from the right people at the right time and stay motivated by following people that inspire them.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with user research, analyzed qualitative data, derived insights, ideated, and brainstormed solutions. We later moved to designing the prototype in Figma. As no design is complete without user feedback, we ended our process with usability testing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recruiting participants for user interviews and usability testing has been a challenge. Despite being in a room full of potential participants as most are busy with their own challenges, we found it hard to approach people to help us out with our design challenge.

                <p>
                    Completing the project. We didn't think we will complete the challenge on time due to time constraints.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing others at the event work helps us stay motivated. 
Young adults are interested in investing but don't have the right resources to get started.

                    What's next for InvestIn - Finra Design Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We skipped the low-fidelity phase due to lack of time. We would like to do some paper prototypes for a few other features we had planned and implement them in the high-fi prototype.
