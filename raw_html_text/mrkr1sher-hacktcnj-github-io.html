                    At first, our group decided to have a chrome extension that detects the user's age through visual recognition. If the child was below 12, it would turn on safe search and redirect any mature content to coolmathgames.com. 
But then, as we were exploring and learning more about machine learning and facial recognition, we saw something very interesting. If we used visual recognition, we learned that we could detect the emotions on the user's face. 
We came up with a new and innovative idea to help parents discipline their kids. As technology advances and children have more and more access to electronic devices, they find new ways to cheat their punishments and have fun while being grounded. Surely, many parents have heard their child whine, "but I need my laptop to do my homework!" Now, with "Turn That Smile Upside Down," parents no longer need to worry! 
Using machine learning and emotion recognition, our project will detect what the user is feeling when they are on their laptop. If the child is happy, our software will automatically close the tab and block it from the child's device. If the child is sad, it will not change the tab, because that is our goal. If the child is scared, the software will automatically reopen the tab anytime it is closed. This way, parents can properly discipline and punish their kids without having to stress. We want to help parents keep their children in check.
