                    How we built it

                    <li>
                        We approached Hanoi developer circle to get the most updated information about the contest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We started with a mockup, then transferred into a sketch design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After that, our back-end team together with BA and front-end team to designed a database based on the design and the initial idea. We decided to use Ruby-on-Rails and GraphQL for our back-end system. We saw a lot of benefits of using GraphQL because it will reduce development effort for both back-end and front-end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Together with back-end guys, front-end guys coded UI using React-native. Front-end team spent around 1 week to completed UI mock then integrated with API, this time we could clearly see the advantages of GraphQL. From the client, we were able to define the data structure and got what we want without any call to back-end: 'Hey we need that, hey we need this, ...'. It was amazing! Sadly, due to a short amount of time, there are some features that are incomplete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our logo designer and video team caught the idea quickly. They cooperated together to designed the Career Ladder logo and produced video in a very efficient way.

                        This is the first time we integrated Ruby-on-Rails with GraphQL, that's why it took time to research and implement.

                    <li>
                        Team management is hard. Our team is up to 9 people with different skills, characters, ages and time. We must balance well to ensure that everything goes right.
