                    The idea of the project is to unify the citizens to help each other, giving them a tool that is capable of getting real time comments and opinions of any populate zone in a city. The app is going to give this comments to the other users as real time news using a reward based system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The reward system
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving a point for each new comment and taking a point for each requested information. This is the way the app makes users feel better when collaborating and the way we assure we can mantain a little bit of information on date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The ranking system
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each user has a global rank, and for each comment that the user does, the others can rate it. This way the users know if a comment is real or fake, because of a users rank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Reports
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each user can report other users. When a comment is not valid, or troll, a user can use the option report to notify for this incidence.
