                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Revolutionary Classroom Response System that uses Bluetooth Low Energy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike other internet based polling system ,it uses the unique feature of BLE to send and receive response without the need for pairing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike physical Clickers that uses RF and requires dedicated RF receiver, this project uses any computer with BLE as well as Arduino 101 as BLE clickers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other solution that uses Smartphones and internet, this project makes use of Arduino 101 for students who cannot afford a smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it rides on BLE, it is friendly on battery consumption
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arduino Sketch for student Arduino Clcikers
UWP for Blicker Teacher App on Win 10

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough sensor switchers as each clickers must have 4 buttons
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe this is the first in the World classroom response system that uses bluetooth low energy.
We hope this project can be a blessings to many teachers and students in other parts of the world where they have no access to internet or smartphone....to be able to use and take advantage of Technology in the classroom
