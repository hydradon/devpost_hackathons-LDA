                    to do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UniTunes was designed to solve the problem that no college student had, of knowing what music was popular in their area. Right out of the gate, UniTunes would accept User input of a User's Spotify name, password and their university, this information would be sent via the Spotify API to communicate with Spotify granting our app authorization to obtain this information, the backend code would then request the users top 5 songs and these songs would be saved in a database. We then planned on being able to call on a database to display the top 5 songs from a User's registered University.

                    A few of UniTunes' features included:
Being able to have the music being played turned down when a person approached from behind. 
Location based tracking to share a User's location to others on their friends list.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized React for the front end development and Python for the backend Spotify API communication. We utilized react to allow the app to work on different platforms without major code changes. We used the Spot.py library to allow easier Spotify implementation.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our issues was learning how to get the two languages to interact with one another. We learned that the languages won't necessarily "talk", but that we could use Flask-CORS to share resources between the front and back end code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned alot. Everything that we faced was new to us, so we found ourselves in workshops and buried deep into implementation. At one point in time, I couldn't see the top of my Chrome as so many tabs were open. We were told this was real software development.
