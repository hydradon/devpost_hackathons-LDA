                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the inspiration from seeing how much Samsung sells the idea of how convenient the Samsung S7 edge panel is. In my personal experience, it was very hard to use and didn't give me that time advantage if I were to access similar apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using accelerometers, it decides to open certain apps. If it is flicked with the right edge facing down, it opens one certain app. If it is flicked face down, then some other app opens up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self learning Android Studio and reading a lot of documentation on how to use Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time I ever delt with Java or Android Studio. Never touched those two things anytime before the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a fairly good conceptual prototype of an android app without knowing how to build an android app when I came in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the complexity of Android Studio and Java and how "Android Java" has its own quirks
                </p>

                    What's next for Flicky
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add customization features such as changing accelerometer sensitivity and changing what each different flick direction opens/does
                </p>
