                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by members of our friends and family who struggled to reenter the workplace after taking time off to raise kids or take care of personal business. We wanted to build a resource hub to assist others with this struggle.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that links to many helpful, relevant resources to help viewers with professional career development and educate them on newer tech industry concepts and terminology.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After trying several different methods, Return Ready was built using Wix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with finding a way of creating, hosting, and publishing our website for free. None of us have prior experience with web development, so creating one from scratch seemed very time-consuming, especially given the convenient template that Wix provides. Even so, we had trouble linking our registered domain name with the website. Before choosing Wix, we experimented with GitHub Pages but still had the same linkage problem. Plus, the GitHub Pages didn't have the convenient templates we wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we have the domain
                    <a href="http://www.returnready.space" rel="nofollow">
                        www.returnready.space
                    </a>
                    ready to deploy and link to our current website thanks to
                    <a href="http://www.domain.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.domain.com
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of all of the helpful resources we were able to put together! We are proud of our aesthetically pleasant and simple design. Based on research we've been reading, Return Ready could be beneficial to a lot of people and the economy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to make a website and the processes behind finding servers and hosting the site. We also learned what to expect from a Hackathon and all of the helpful resources that HackDavis provides!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Return Ready
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hope is that the concept we imagined can transform into in-person workshops to further assist our target audience. The ultimate goal would be to have a team of program managers who can consult businesses who want to build out their own versions of "returnships".
