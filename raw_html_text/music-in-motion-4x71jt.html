                        Introducing Circles.
                    </strong>
                    While previous iterations have attempted lines, swipes, and even taps, none have lived up to expectations like
                    <strong>
                        Circles
                    </strong>
                    The innovation that is the circle will bring new dimensions to the spotify experience.
                    <strong>
                        In all Seriousness
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a little program called
                    <strong>
                        Music In Motion
                    </strong>
                    that uses the Spotify API and a Leap Motion to translate hand motions to various actions in Spotify. Basic functions include pause, play, shuffle, change playlist, and stop. Throughout the night of testing, we found that the only gesture that's truly recognized more than 20% of the time on the Leap Motion was the circle, and thus "Circles" was born.
