                    Master Plan Part Deux
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people believe that cars will become fully autonomous within the next decade. With such a disruptive innovation becoming prevalent in our everyday lives, we chose to embrace it and investigate a potential integration. We built a dashboard and accompanying hardware to make people's self-driving experience easier and more secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from simply navigating both urban and highway environments autonomously, Tesla believes these cars will be able to subsidize some of their own cost by acting as a distributed, driverless, rideshare program, which Musk calls the Shared Fleet. When car owners are not using their cars, which is an estimated 90-95% of the time, the car can fill the ride requests of other drivers and earn money for the owner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three main parts to this design. We focused on:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Safety/Security
                    </strong>
                    The blockchain we intended to implement would revolutionize the implementation of the Shared Fleet. The likelihood of compromised transaction data (which, as of late, has become a painstakingly frequent occurrence) becomes completely irrelevant due to the secure nature of blockchain.. and rather than credit card companies being the benefactors of service charges, the decentralized fees could be spent on maintaining heavily used rural/urban infrastructures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Simplicity
                    </strong>
                    We realize that the transition from a world of human control to a driverless one may feel like a loss of power and security. With this in mind, we included lots of meta data that drivers are used to seeing on their dashboard like charge (or gas if we still use that in 2027), tire pressure, and other information, that albeit not necessary, makes the driver feel comfortable. We also included Microsoft Azure's voice to text tools to include some verbal queries about the car. These can include anything from "Are we there yet?" to "Open the trunk!" which make the new tools easier to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With RFID tags, we can distinguish the owner of the car from guest riders. RFID could be an alternative for anyone who doesn't have access to a cellphone, or even an example of how cell phone NFC chips could be used. This opens up the ride-sharing market to children (with parental permission of course!) and elderly citizens.
