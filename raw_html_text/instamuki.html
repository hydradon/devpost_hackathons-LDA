                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We inspired by idea to display any image on the Muki cup. Owner of the cup shouldn't do anything to charge device, just to fill it with a hot drink! Our main idea is to display fresh news on the cup's display especially in the morning just after waking up. As far as Muki cup has low-resolution e-Ink and small display we decided that the best way to show fresh news will be posts from Instagram social network which are emphasis on images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an Android application that establishes pairing with Muki cup and performs authorization in the Instagram. After that each time our application launches it fetches yours friends posts from Instagram, choose the freshest one and transfer it to the cup along with the post' owner info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have create an Android project based on a Muki api sample and investigated how image transfer works. Then we embedded an integration with Instagram via fetching the most recently uploaded image from owner friends list. Also it was too inconvenient to connect to Muki device each time when we want to transfer image, cause it required a cup id. That's why we decided to add a QR-code scanner for simplification. Also a settings screen purposed to store cup id and Instagram authorization token was added.
We made an accent that Muki cup owner shouldn't do anything in Instagram (likes any photos, mark them by hashtag or etc.) except of authorization once. All job will be held by updates of users he is following. And possible that those ppl wouldn't be guess that their post can be shown on the new generation cup!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody of our team uses Instagram API before. It was a challenge to receive the most recently uploaded image from user's friends list because of Instagram hasn't direct endpoint for this purpose.
We made a goal that Muki cup owner shouldn't do anything in Instagram (likes any photos, mark them by hashtag or etc.) except of authorization once. All job should be held by updates of users he is following.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enforce this great device to
                    <strong>
                        work
                    </strong>
                    ! :-) Really, bluetooth-pairing
                    <strong>
                        very
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        very
                    </strong>
                    unstable and not every device was able to keep connection. The work was slow cause a cup has a power from hot water. Each time the temperature slows down the work stops until refreshing cup with a hot water again. We are proud that accomplished our application with working features less than in 1 weekend.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instagram API, Muki API, how to charge and refresh Muki cup device and a headache of bluetooth pairing :-) How to embed a QR scanner and collaborate with team members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaMuki
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add push notification to automatically upload images from Instagram directly to the Muki cup without owner interaction. We hope people will be happy to see real-time images from their follow list at the morning while fill cup with a hot coffee.
Also if we win, we will submit our Instagram client for review by one's team (for now it works in sandbox mode)
We are expected the next generation of Muki cup that will have higher resolution enough to display more complex text post or bundle of tweets
