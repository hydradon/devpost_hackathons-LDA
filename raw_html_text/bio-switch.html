                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are too lazy to control the lights manually. A light control system is needed to automatically set appropriate light condition for people meanwhile provides effortless interfaces for user to control the light condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bio-Switch is an intelligent light control solution, which comprehensively collects and analyzes human emotional and physical data to determine the appropriate in-door light condition. Bio- Switch 1) automatically learns the appropriate light condition from the detected human emotional data as well as basic psychology knowledge, 2) creates user-friendly interface by allowing human voice as user input, and 3) changes the light condition based on simple human action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Bio-Switch with four types of sensors, laptops, smart phones, and a central controller.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A color camera is deployed to detect human facial expression while a smart ring is used to sense human stress level, together profiling human emotion.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A voice sensor is deployed to collect human voice as input for controlling light condition.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A infrared camera is deployed to detect human existence and simple human action.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A light sensor is deployed to detect the actual intensity of light, so that Bio-Switch is able to more accurate.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A central controller is deployed in the room to process the continuous data stream sent from the above sensors and change the light condition through DALI controller's REST APIs.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, as the cloud service is crowded, data transmission is relatively slow, especially for the data of Moodmetric ring. We implemented an app on Android to connect the ring with Bluetooth, then the transmission rate is much larger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bio-Switch is able to modify the light intensity and color of the lights automatically with the information of human speech command, human emotional data and human actions. This greatly reduces the energy users would have to waste to interactive with the light.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt how to combine the data input from multiple data sources using a server, and how to perform distributed calculation in a project. Also, our teamwork spirit is exercised in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bio-Switch
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We will concentrate on the scalability of Bio-Switch, with multiple lights and multiple people in the room.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bio-Switch will be able to modify the parameters according to the actual use of users.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will also use opencv library to detect more motions.
