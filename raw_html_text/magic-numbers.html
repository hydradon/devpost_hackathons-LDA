                    'Magic numbers' is developed purely with the intent of making math easier and fun for kids. It is an Alexa skill which will walk you through some steps as a part of the game. It basically asks you to guess a number and then asks you to perform some calculations on top of it. After a certain number of steps, it tells you what number you have reached finally. In some other tricks, it will figure out what your secret number is that you guessed in the first step of the game.

                    If you really look at the calculations done by you as a part of the game and try to solve it, you will find out these are simple algebraic expressions that Alexa asked you to solve for a secret number. Kids can revisit the steps and see that it was a simple equation they just solved for Alexa by playing this game with Alexa.

                    I have shared the demo of this Alexa skill here. It's very simple and easy to use. All you have to ask Alexa is to start this skill and then just keep asking for next steps. Finally, Alexa will ask you for the final answer or tells you what number you reached in the last step.
You can also ask Alexa to repeat the step in case you missed it or took longer to do the calculation.
