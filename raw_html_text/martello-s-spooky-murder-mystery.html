                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to solve the murder mystery. We wanted to work with a data  set
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We resorted the data by names to identify the actions on each person. Then, we animated the members to map out how they interact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first brainstormed to look at how we can approach the problem to see if we can analyze the data using different approaches. We created a graphical representation with nodes, and then sorted the data into a different structure. We then animated the people at different nodes and then made a nicer interface using JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble starting, however we then just started programming and then ideas came along the way. We had issues with parsing JSON in JS at one point, however we resolved it and kept going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We persevered and never gave up, even in the worse of times!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To analyze data and find a graphical way to display the results in a clear format.

                    What's next for Martello's Spooky Murder Mystery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully not another murder! However, to keep working on data analysis and work with handling large quantities of information.
