                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built for parents, it tracks the users internet activity (which websites visited and how much time they spent on there)
It is also password protected(for parents) and an option to set up a "tracking time" is available, you want to give your children a little bit of freedom right
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript and html coded in visual code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time our team has ever used javascript and google chrome api, so there were many issues that we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a functional app, it's not the best but it works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google Chrome API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Internet Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps set up a better way to send "daily logs/update" of their children usage. Google Chrome extension does not support sending API so we need to look for a better way.
