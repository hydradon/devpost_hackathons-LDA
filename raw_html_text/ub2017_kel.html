                    In todays world trade jobs are becoming less and less in fashion but are always necessary. This device will help teach people the basic skills needed to enter the carpenter trade.

                    Our intent was to create a device that would scan and track the dimensions of a piece of wood placed on the standing platform. It would then take the data and display the "block" within an editor for the end user to modify as they need. The modifications would then be projected onto the block. From there the user will mark the block and begin to cut.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Structurally we kept simple, using foam blocks for the walls and base of the stand. This allowed for us to hang a projector and camera from the top. For software, we used python with a few libraries like OpenCV, Numpy, and TKinter. OpenCV was used for block recognition and data extrapolation. We then used TKinter for all windowing and drawing to the projector.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the color of the foam we were using there were many issues that arose during block recognition. Mainly similar luminosities creating issues with the camera "seeing" the block. We fixed it by covering the foam with a black layer. The entire team was relatively inexperienced with python, which led to many errors and hours of bug fixing. We took on project that may have been too intense for a group of first time hackers.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up with a working prototype. One of our key accomplishments was block recognition with very basic setup. As well as the creation of templates and projecting them onto the wood in practice not just in theory.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something we should have done was familiarize ourselves with our tools prior to the event. We need better time management for specific tasks and to keep organized through the entire event. Other hackers can be useful for collaborating on ideas that are outside of our field of knowledge.

                    What's next for Apprentice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current plan is for one of our group members to continue the project through their final capstone project. Being more specific we would like to fully incorporate computer vision to not only see the top of the block but depth as well. Create a working editor for the user to design and implement on the fly. Making a prototype out of more reliable materials.
