                    It displays a graphical representation*NOTE* You MUST run it using administrator, otherwise the program cannot access the log files. Also, you MUST configure windows firewall to log as many things as it can!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I scrap Windows Firewall's log files for the ips, and then use an API to do a database lookup for the location of the ip.
I then use another API to generate a map for the locations.

                    Json is very strange, and Java doesn't have a library build into it for some reason... 
Also I hate REGEX now &gt;:O (whatever you do, do not try to make your own scraper)
