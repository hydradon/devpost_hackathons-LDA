                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from our group's combined interest in social justice causes. We come from a campus that has a rich cultural background and awareness of social issues, which made the decision to pursue the project easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a rating system inspired by RateMyProfessor that instead allows users to rate their encounters with police officers and leave reviews.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MySQL as the database backend to store the users, officers, and the reviews made by users.  We used Django and Python to quickly setup the website, and HTML, CSS, and Django templates to decorate the website. The website uses no Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team isn't experienced whatsoever in web development, so we ran into a few challenges learning how to use Django and SQL databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn web development, write a website, and work coherently as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Django framework and how to construct and work with MySQL databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlueRate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our search feature is far too basic. We chose it for the lack of a better search function that could be implemented in the short time. Some features we didn't get to that we plan to improve in the future are the user interface, registration, and signing in, and posting reviews. We have a basic code to post reviews, but it is not connected to the SQL database yet, and therefore needs work.
