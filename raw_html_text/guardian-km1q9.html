                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team started without any idea of what to do at the hackathon, but we decided to combine many different projects ideas, and the data and hardware proved by companies, while still using it in a useful way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guardian uses Washington D.C.'s crime data to flag the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city. Using the Pebble smartwatch, we send the user an alert whenever they have enter one of those flagged areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were using the realtime position of the user through the GPS on their phone, and converting the crime data and locations into zones through the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the ability to create software on a never-before-used platform and create a simple, yet, very useful software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the potential uses of combining software and hardware, and the scale of what can be done with focused work, in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guardian
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to add realtime crime alerts for crimes happening within the vicinity of the user. We would also like to use AI software to better evaluate the neighborhoods, by evaluating the time of day of crimes, the type of crime, and the severity. We also thought about applying Guardian to other cities and possibly other applications, such as purchases being made for employer data, venues that match the users interests, and special events happening near users.
