                    Inspiration. We wanted to do this because we wanted to make college research much easier.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does. So, the program brings a bunch of colleges together so you don't have to always research so much because with this app everything would be there.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it, we used vb6 which is an old programming language. We took list-boxes to list out most of the colleges in America and there was a textbox right above it to help with the search. We also added another form so that we could add all the information about the colleges in label boxes. The information wasn't too in-depth but it was things like GPA, SAT/ACT, and acceptance rates
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into. One challenge we ran into is how we could actually shorten the list other than making it highlighted because right now when we used the textbox it would just highlight the possible college if you type in a letter. For instance, if you type in the letter 'S' for Stanford then the all the colleges without the letter S would still be there and we wanted them to be removed and only have the 'S' section. Another thing was shorting it with majors, so having a list box full of majors and if you clicked on one it would make the list of colleges smaller depending on the colleges and there majors, for instance if you put in the major of engineering then MIT would still be there but a college for liberal arts wouldn't.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of. We are proud of making a list box answers output to another form. And getting all the research up.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned. We learned a lot about colleges due to our research but we also learned new aspects of vb6 and how we can use certain things and use them in our code. We also learned how to switch variables between forms.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for college buddy. We expect college buddy to become more resourceful with more colleges from all around the world and have a lot more information about the campus of the certain colleges and if we can compare 2 colleges.
