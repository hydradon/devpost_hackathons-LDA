                    -BY USING THE KNITTING MACHINE TO PRODUCE THE GLOVES-WE ARE SAVING TIME, SAVING FABRIC SINCE THE ACCURACY OF THE MACHINE COMPARED TO THE GLOVES THAT ARE MANUFACTURED IN FACTORIES-IT HAS A GOOD CAUSE IN OUR SOCIETY SINCE IT WILL CREATE MORE JOBS THAT WOULD REQUIRE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE,  WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PURSUE ADVANCE EDUCATION FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
-AS WELL, WHEN PRODUCING THE GLOVES, OUR FIRST CHOICE WOULD BE GOING TOWARDS VEGAN LEATHER, WHICH WOULD BE ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY AS WELL AS ITS LONG DURABILITY.

                        THE IDEAL IS TO MAKE THE WIRELESS DEVICE SMALLER, FUNCTION MORE SMOOTHER, HAVE THE QUALITY TO BE FLEXIBLE; BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART WOULD BE HAVING A PRACTICAL, IMPERCEPTIBLE DEVICE WITH THE IMPROVED AND ADVANCED PERFORMANCES.
