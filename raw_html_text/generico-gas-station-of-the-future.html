                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were heavily inspired by the emerging use of mobile technologies to streamline 
the process of transactions in the gas station and associated convenience stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, it creates a quick scan / id based pump location system, to determine the store inventory and service listing for client browsing and purchasing. Second, the system automates the process of gas payment and convenience purchases through the use of semi-autonomous shelving robots, receiving shopping lists virtually, and collecting items for the client to pick up at a kiosk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a preliminary system of storage in Java, but quickly decided to discard that prototype to create a more web friendly Javascript and HTML solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning integral components of the Javascript language's functionality. Mocking up data in spreadsheets to show our concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing CSVs in Javascript, and generating web page content in a legible format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a language we are unfamiliar with (although probably a bad idea in hackathons) and making progress within this environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "Generico" Gas Station of the Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would have like to have done a mock-up of the internal store structure, with the shelving bots collecting a client's items and delivering them to a kiosk for pickup, and also to have had some system of payment mocked up.
