                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As university students in a connected environment, we struggled with constantly owing each other different sums of money and trying to keep track of it all. We wanted an easier way to split group bills, track spending, and make sure we know where our money goes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to take a picture of a receipt and parses out each item and its associated price, presenting that on a visually appealing screen. Then, you're able to allocate each item to an individual or a group, making the e-transfer process much simpler and intuitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sketch for the visual design of the application and the OCR.space receipt scanning API to scan the receipt. This was all put together in Xcode, written in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a short hackathon so there were a lot of time constraint issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all feel that this is an extremely useful app that we'd love to have, so we're definitely proud of the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was great to learn more about image processing and the intricacies of that, and the different options out there. It was also our first time working with Swift and Xcode, and one of our designers first time designing!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hopefully we can continue to work on this project and improve based on the feedback we receive.
