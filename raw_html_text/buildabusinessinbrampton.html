                <p>
                    Build a Business in Brampton&rsquo;s (BBB) objective is to help emerging businesses find an optimal location to build their business using map data and metadata from Esri Tech&rsquo;s ArcGIS and Brampton Open Data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we were unsure about how to create value from the main API which we used. Having an abundance of data on Brampton gave us many potential ideas, but we came to the conclusion that applying the data to determine where to start a business in Brampton would be. As mentioned earlier, Brampton is the fastest growing city in Canada, and there fore using data to aid in the process of starting new and upcoming businesses seemed the most viable and disruptive option.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accessed spatial data using GeoHub, in addition to layers of filters with the database provided by ArcGIS. As well, we learned how to program using Arcade to create streetview samples of potential areas of interest for Brampton business owners.
