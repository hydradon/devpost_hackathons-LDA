                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was built using html5 canvas, CSS and JS

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not a senior developer, I am still learning. So making this work was not very easy. I did a lot of research and studying. 
Some major challanges were making the blocks, fire and air strikers move in different directions with different roles to play. If was really fun developing this game.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's is the very first game I have ever developed. So I am proud of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot. The most important thing I learnt was if I am willing, I can do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stay in the air
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I intend to make it bigger and more sophisticated. And while not using other tools if possible and where necessary. I like the idea and it will be a joy to see others use it.
