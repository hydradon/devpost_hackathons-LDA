                    We were inspired by the fact that many people with deadly diseases are not even aware that they have this disease. Along the way of creating this, we learned many new functions that we could do in python and other languages.  We built this project using python and kivy, along with information from a number of creditable sources. Some challenges were that we didn't know how to do many of the tasks and trying to debug the code. All of these things lead us to our final result, Disease Browser.
