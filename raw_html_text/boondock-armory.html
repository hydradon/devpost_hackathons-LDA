                    This website is about a dream that I have had now for about 7 years

                    I have seen this domain open for the past few years and finally acquired it

                    There is no posting of anything on the website.  I am not very well versed in JAVA or HTML anymore.  My last programming course was 12-14 years ago.

                    What's next for Boondock Armory is hopefully a claim in angel investors along with my Mechanical Engineering degree and hopefully a small business grows out of this.  Mobile site is also active.
