                    Paradise Escape is an app to innovate and excite. On this app the user can add flight details in order for them to interact with the plane system. Whether it is connecting flights or any late departure or early arrivals the app is lets the user access it. On the app you can also view the location you are in on the sky. It shows the altitude and how many minutes you have been up on the air. You can also request for the flight attendant for beverages, food, and snacks requests, as well as other amenities. Zen mode allows you to turn off all the notifications and alerts when you do not want to hear them, except for emergencies. These emergancy messages are sent to you are at a state of emergency. As soon as you land you get an arrival message sent to you and your loved ones. Our app connects with lift and or Uber, to help you navigate from the airport to your next destination; this request is sent after the arrival message. Paradise Escape is a way to innovate and create something that has never been seen before.
