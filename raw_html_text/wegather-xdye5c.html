                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My grandparents were the inspiration for the Save Family Photos project. I'm lucky to have matriarchs and patriarchs who love telling stories. My grandmother had a wall of family photos that I walked by often. On that wall, I saw faces full of hopes and dreams before I ever existed. Every time I walked by that wall, I realized
                    <strong>
                        My story started before me.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When my grandfather died, I wanted to celebrate the legacy he left behind. So I started scanning old photos of him &mdash; from his childhood to his military service, from marrying my grandmother to raising my mother. Then, I posted a photo and a story about him on Instagram and invited family and friends to do the same. In turn, they encouraged people in their networks to share. Now I receive thousands of family photos and stories from around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Save Family Photos started as a personal project on Instagram and quickly grew into a virtual campfire where families gather to share their stories, one photo at a time.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    weGather is a free, purpose-driven app that helps families capture the stories behind old analog photos in a fun, social way. Rather than focusing on digitization and storage, weGather focuses on story collection using the power of crowdsourcing. weGather is narrowly-scoped, launching with a focused feature set that's optimized for mobile devices. We're creating an app that's fun to use and most important, gets multiple family members involved quickly!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding (the right) software developers. We believe in building a team, not just a product. Great teams build great products! So after an extensive search, we are grateful to have a team of four wonderful developers and designers in Berlin, Germany. My husband, Andrew, serves as the head of product and technology.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Posting a family photo and story every day on Instagram since September 2013, and growing our community to 25,000 loyal followers. You can get involved with our community here:

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Family photos are universally appealing. They're the glue that holds our stories together across generations. Simply put, they're the best way to trigger family storytelling!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for weGather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of iteration, followed by a monetization strategy. My husband, Andrew, earned his MBA recently and weGather was the basis for his thesis. A portion of the thesis focused on growth and monetization strategies, so we already have some ideas for next steps. :)
