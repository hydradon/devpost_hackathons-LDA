                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To eliminate kids from searching the web for good educational content, allowing them to vote and submit what they and their peers think are good educational material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this web application is to provide a community governed, kid friendly corner, which allows user to submit high rated educational videos and games the public community can add build together using the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site uses ethereum's blockchain to store website information, and allows the community to add or remove content based on a general consensus vote. Using Google's Plus API, we allow users to be able to login and vote, and or submit content to be included for children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used truffle, and allot of hardwork trying to create a web API which services as a portal to go content the community deems through votes.
