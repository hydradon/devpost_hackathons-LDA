                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think about how convenient our lives have become since the dawn of smartphones. However, according to the world health organization, about 4.1% of the world&rsquo;s population, or about 400 million people consider themselves deaf or have serious difficulty hearing. And all these people face a lot of difficulties while communicating in situations we might take for granted.
Our theme today is connecting dots, and we strongly believe that we'd be connecting a lot of those dots by helping the deaf community - we provide an entirely new approach for deaf people to communicate, and the promise of our tech is to let them experience greater connectivity in life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        EASI is an Electronic Assist for Sign Interpretation. It helps bridge the communication gap between the deaf population and the mainstream society. Upon research, we found that interpreting and understanding English text obtained using prevalent Speech-To-Text isn't as easy for a deaf person as it is for most of us. Essentially, deaf people do not have native access to English, since they don't hear the vocabulary and linguistic patterns of the language from birth, and instead are more exposed to sign language. This puts them at a certain disadvantage when interpreting English text
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EASI is oriented towards delivering sign-language interpretations from a speech in real-time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EASI provides users with the opportunity to create, store, and share their customized signs for certain phrases that permeate through multiple social strata
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also provide a website page for them to seamlessly have a coherent experience across different platforms. The website increases accessibility to users who cannot get access to the app while enabling users to manage data anytime, anywhere
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    implementing Google-cloud services with flutter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We run a custom algorithm to find and suggest the best suitable phrase for a given social interaction based on the previous usage of the app and a few keywords
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are proud that EASI will be very helpful to a large group of people, that they can find their ways hearing and staying connected
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a large amount of research about difficulties deaf people are facing right now, as well as the inconvenience and weakness of the apps existing already and we found that a lot of deaf people still cannot get used to relying on technology communicating with people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EASI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to implement more features to the EASI, like gesture recognition. Also, we will provide solutions to help with the communication between deaf people
