                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students have a hard time understanding exactly how much they drink and the impacts of binge drinking. We aim to educate them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users have the ability to enter their age, weight, and gender. They can then enter the alcohol percentage and amount of alcohol in their drink. The app will estimate the BAC in the drink and keep a running track of the user's BAC.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of open source software to put the project together. Our main focus was creating a slick UX so users would have as few issues with the UI as possible past a certain level of intoxication. Javascript drives the application while php and mysql provide persistent data storage.
