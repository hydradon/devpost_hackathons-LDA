                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem is traditional education is not perfect and not fun. In this old-school way of teaching children are not motivated and grades even lead to fear of failing. On the other side, learning through digital media can be harmful when it is not curated and consumed too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With GoFindMe, an AR learning tool, we want to take the best out of both worlds. Enabling the vast possibilities and knowledge of the digital world while exploring the real life reality.

                    Teachers or parents are handed a tool to create customised learning experiences for their children (for age group 7-14 years). Those experiences are mini games similar to treasure hunts. Teachers/parents choose a word depicted in an image. The children see the image in the app and have to search for letters depicted in their real life immediate vicinity to spell the missing word. For this, the child has to capture the letters it found with the camera. This way they learn and improve their spelling in a gamified way.

                        Child explores their immediate environment for the letters that form the word and scans the letter.

                        To complete the learning experience, the child has to scan all letters to form the desired word.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we all had different backgrounds such as back-end, front-end and UX. The issues came in combining the different projects together at the end. In the start we had the different parts working but they were separate. To combine them to work as a project, it meant we would need to work with each other as a team to complete this task in the time span of 24 hours that were given. We also had issues with getting the project set up with android because of configuration issues but with the different skill sets we had, it was possible to overcome this with teamwork.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us didn&rsquo;t know each other before, we met for the first time at the TC Disrupt hackathon. Nevertheless we managed to work together very well as a team.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    When starting a project from scratch with a team of strangers and only 24hrs to build it, we learned the idealization process is an important one but is best to be limited in time.
