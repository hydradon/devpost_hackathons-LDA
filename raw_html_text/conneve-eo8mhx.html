                <p>
                    Seeing as people are looking for public compatriots to participate in activities with. This was especially noticed during orientation activities where people were introducing themselves to a crowd of people and talking about their interests and hoping that they would find someone else in the crowd with similar interests.

                <p>
                    We have created a cross platform module/app based on HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. We sought to think about different ideas and finalised some and then finally came down to this.

                    What's next for Conneve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conneve is at a very embryonic stage right now, and its potential can includes a more intricate event matching algorithm, an interface with more layers, and the possible addition of an activity control center where there can be widgets and more information displayed.
