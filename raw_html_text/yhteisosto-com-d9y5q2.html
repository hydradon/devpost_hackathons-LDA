                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first of all started with the BigData track and started to build a solution for them. Halfway through we realized that the task was too daunting to be done in this period of time so we started think of something else and we came up with the FINTECH peer payments. We made a quick tour around the stands(Holvi, Bankify and Nordea) to validate our project and we rushed in to coding because it was already Saturday evening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a basic where you can start collect money from your peers to achieve something bigger together like trips, events or investments. You can create an payment collection account and share a link where your peers can pay with their credit card. Safely. We've also implemented features like withdrawal to a bank account (collector) and an ability to send recites about the used money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically we implemented the basic access level control, Facebook login, Stripe payments and Blockchain database for fault tolerance and verifiability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our stack was ReactJS for Frontend, NodeJS for API, Go for blockchain and Stripe for payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project itself was started very late when compairing to the others. We started coding around 9 PM Sat and we coded the whole night to get our project done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use blockchain for distributed fraud tolerant database. Our main idea is that all the transactions in the system are permanent. Because blockchain provides us create-only system where updating or deleting data is virtually impossible it is the best solution. In conjunction with strong identification it creates a system where committing a identity fraud is very hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically the coding itself was kind of easy but the blockchain itself was totally new for all of us so the biggest leap (&amp;pain) was blockchain. In the same pain we were struggling with finding a proper identification method. Also we run into a need of sleep because of the tight schedule.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly production ready project in 14h. Also we haven't been together this long ever before.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we're awesome and the basic of blockchain usage.
