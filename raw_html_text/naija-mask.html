                    I am my team were working on a illustration project, focused on creating local Nigerian illustration, in the course of the project, we came across Spark AR and decided to create a filter with some of the mask illustrations we have already created.

                <p>
                    The Naija Mask was a way of extending out creativity and at the same time allowing us share the experience with the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was a quick one though, this is our first AR project and we never had any previous experience working with AR. We took online tutorials and were able to come up with this within 3 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced lots of challenges and one of our major challenge was making our 2d models fit like 3d on the filters, we noticed that they were distorted and couldn't really do much about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were really happy when we came up with the final product for this project, it was really encouraging that we could come up with something like this even as beginners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learnt how we can share our experience with the outside world and promote our content and also saw lots of ways we could improve better in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We got lots of positive feedback but we need to work on making the experience better and adding interactions to our experience. We are currently working on creating our masks in 3d using blender and i believe that will really help.
