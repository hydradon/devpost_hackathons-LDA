                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thomas always felt like there was so much to do in his hometown Sonthofen but most tourists only get to see the ski slopes. Therefore we created an application that helps travelers to get the full Allg&auml;u-experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sp&auml;tzle-Jagd is not just another boring coupon app that promotes businesses to you. It connects you with locals and other travelers while providing you with awesome challenges that make exploring your surroundings
                    <strong>
                        even more
                    </strong>
                    exciting.
You'll get a whole bunch of local experiences other people enjoyed. In order to get exclusive discounts from our partners you have to share proof (in form of creative pictures and funny quizzes) that you completed the challenge with other tourists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the latest and greatest tools for creating android apps: Android studio was used for our apps front-end while plan on creating an node.js back-end server in order to actually connect the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us has ever build an android app before. Learning such an amount of new concepts within just a few hours sure was a challenge but it was also a super fun an interesting opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the idea of building an tourism app that stands out of the mass by combining fun concepts from excising traveling services, social networking
                    <strong>
                        and
                    </strong>
                    mixed reality gaming!.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a surprisingly broad knowledge base on app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sp&auml;tzle-Jagd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we need to add more things to do in the Allg&auml;u until users are willing to use and contribute to the app. Additionally the concept only works if there are interesting local partners. Finding these should not be very hard though, since they benefit from the application as well.
There is of course still room for improvement from a technical point of view. For instance users can't create accounts yet.
                </p>

                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we make a objectively great app, we also had a lot of fun while we were at it!
