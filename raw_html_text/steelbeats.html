                </h2>
                <p>
                    "What would I rap like... if I could rap?"
"What would Donald Trump's debut album sound like?"
"Would Kim Kardashian's raps be laced with profanity or just product placement?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are pressing, important questions as we head into a future of machine learning and signal processing powered by devices like Alexa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, some really cool researchers at KDD'16 developed Dope Learning, what's to date the most advanced algorithm for generating good rap:

                        https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04771
                    </a>
                    . You should check it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use our Alexa skill, just say, "Alexa, ask for a rap." She'll just ask you for a name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tell Alexa to rap as someone and she'll drop sick beats on you based on their speech patterns, topics of interest, and overall writing style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do this by scraping a target user's Twitter account, constructing a Markov model, and combining that with a "Dope Learning"-derived model that recombines rap lyrics from accomplished English-language rappers based on topics and speech patterns from our Markov model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project aggregates our model of a user's personality with the Dope Learning model of what a good rapper would sound like, combining their interests and written behavioral patterns with assonance rhymes, rhythm, and poetic structure.
                </p>

                    Aggregating a good rapper model with the writing patterns of people who are decidedly not rappers. Tweets aren't exactly sick rhymes.

                    Getting Alexa to rap instead of just talk (hint: lots of pause control!).

                    Learning: Alexa Skills, AWS Lambda, Python, Selenium, reading a few research papers in the process, and building our Markov model, etc.
