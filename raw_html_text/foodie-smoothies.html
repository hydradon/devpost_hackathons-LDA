                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are always struggling to decide what to make with the food that we have, so we decided to make an application to give us suggestions on what we can do with the food that we have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are building a web application where users can take pictures of their pantry, refrigerator, and freezer. The application will keep track of the food they have and make cooking recipe recommendations based on the ingredients the user has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using google's web app platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty in setting up the tutorial and getting it to actually work. Other challenges that we came across were being able to communicate between Google's cloud buckets and our web app, and heavy eye strain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got the web app to work, and can read at least two fruits as once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google Cloud Platform to build a web application, and we learned how to use Google Cloud Platform Vision. Even though we struggled through it, we definitely learned a lot. But most importantly, we learned how to stay positive when nothing is working, and we learned to read things carefully the first time, so we don't have to go back and read it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodie Smoothies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to read multiple fruits of the same kind, and be able to read any food to make all recipes, not just smoothies
