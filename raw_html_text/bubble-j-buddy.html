                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I interviewed with my friend's younger cousin at UCI. He's something that is on the spectrum. And while I was interviewing him he gave me lots of hints that he fails to recognize emotional cues and really wants to have a companion that he can just talk to about random things. Then came the inspiration for Bubble J Buddy. Also because I love spongebob and bubble buddy is one of his best pals. This buddy is for everyone who needs someone to talk or someone to talk with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bubble buddy has 7 distinct emotions shown: angry, scared, happy, sad, disgusted, thinking, and laughing. He chats with you by pulling a question or conversation line from a mLab mongodb database I set up with 29 questions and 35 conversations. He also lets you talk to him as a personal assistant with emotions attached by soundhound houndify api. And there's some secret marvel api secrets around his custom designed house :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a MEAN stack template app and started hacking away. There were a lot of things I knew I could've done because bubble j buddy is like a chatbot. However, I wanted to convey the emotion with it so that's why I have made my own personal database of questions and conversations for now. In the future, once I made learned enough and got enough feedback with sentiment analysis from my questions or when the user of my apps send recordings or texts to bubble buddy. Then I can start doing some machine learning and building some solid conversations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time to do all the designs and get everything I wanted when working by myself. If I had maybe 4 more hours I would've completed every feature that I would have wanted

                    How to launch an app successfully from start to finish. How to use marvel api and soundhound api. Sleep is good for the soul. I slept for one hour total.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watson tone analyzer pairs well with my different animations for emotions. Also add comic books under the table for Disney Marvel API if I don't get that done quick enough. Use Watson API for Tone Analysis
