                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by various social media sites such as Reddit, Twitter, and Yik Yak to develop a way for hackers to communicate with each other during the period of a Hackathon only.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackers use the website to discuss what is going on at the Hackathon as well as brain storm and collaborate amongst each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new platforms. No one in the group had extensive web development experience so we all had to push ourselves to learn something new as quickly as we can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited to see that we could take our minimal experience with web development and bring our idea to life in less than 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how important it is to collaborate in a team and how much more efficiently work can get done with proper communication. We also learned how helpful a Hackathon is for learning new technology; Being surrounded by tons of like minded individuals with a common passion motivates us to pursue our interests and work hard to learn new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackathon Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to build Hackathon Hub to become an event feed that can be reused at any Hackathon. We hope people will be able to use it to collaborate on an idea, seek help on a solution, ask for advice, or just express their opinions and interest in how the Hackathon is going.
