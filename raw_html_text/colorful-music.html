                <p>
                    This project deals with converting colors to sounds. The hue of the color affects the frequency of the sound, while the lightness affects how a special flanger effect is applied to the sound.

                <p>
                    We apply our function in two ways: with image and with colors.

                <h2>
                    Play With Image
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upload an image. The three most dominant colors in the image are determined. Each of those colors is converted into a sound wave, and the three resulting sound waves are played simultaneously as a chord.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Play With Colors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use the mouse to click anywhere on our rainbow gradient. The color underneath the mouse is converted into a sound wave, and that sound wave is played.
