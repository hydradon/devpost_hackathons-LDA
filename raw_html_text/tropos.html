                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tropos is a platform that empowers employees to access key insights about their business using only their voice. Access the information you need as naturally as having a conversation with a colleague.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Tropos came from a frustration of both creating and using typical visualization dashboards.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating dashboards is a painful experience and requires knowledge of SQL or other query languages. Why not be able to use plain english to query for data?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consuming dashboards is also challenging because if you're having a conversation or are in a meeting, you have to switch contexts and look at a screen and navigate through menus to find the right dashboard. With something like this in place, if you&rsquo;re ever having a conversation with a colleague you no longer need to switch context and look at a screen, or navigate through a menu when you need reference data. You can instead continue your dialog and naturally communicate with Alexa to retrieve the information you need.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tropos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Tropos is to ramp up marketing and start finding first customers so we can find product/market fit.
