                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pit fighting / gladiators. We thought it would be fun to make an arcade game about fighting in an arena!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter the arena, kill the monsters, buy any upgrades, and continue fighting more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the unreal engine (which took 7 hours to install by the way) and just had fun adding as many features as we could to the game before the deadline
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were problems with saving our variables and sorting out hitboxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy our game! We were able to link an xbox controller to it and it's just so fun to play in our opinion. We have a shop system and an entire 3D arena to play in! We also made the game get much harder/easier according to how well the player was doing in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the unreal engine from having no previous knowledge while Ciaran learned to use parts of it he had never used before.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    More pits, more fights, more monsters. Cool stuff basically.
