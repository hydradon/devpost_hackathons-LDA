                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really value "ideas" and "feedback," and that's what this app is all about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is also about thinking differently and being creative. For example, this competition was geared towards creating a solution that would promote only one of Idaho&rsquo;s three main industries: Agriculture, Healthcare, or Tourism, but my focus turned into creating an app with the potential to boost Idaho&rsquo;s economy across all three.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idaho Think Tank is a new social platform for sharing ideas. Following the focus of this competition, users can create, share, vote, and comment on ideas under the three given categories: Idaho Agriculture, Idaho Healthcare, and Idaho Tourism. If people work together and connect for "social brainstorming", we're going to improve our state and solve our problems much quicker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also introduces what I call "Social Pricing", where we leverage the wisdom of the crowd to arrive at a more accurate price point for a given product or idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, besides the social aspect and the appeal of getting views and ranking for content, the main goal, in a sense, is to turn ideas into money. It's one thing to have a good idea, but when you have a good idea with a number tied to it representing it's value and backed by a large sampling of people, decisions are going to be made much faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do something mobile, but I worried about tying myself to only one platform (android or iOS). However, I was fortunate to come across the Ionic Framework in school, which allows you to build cross platform mobile apps with just one code base. I was hooked almost immediately. I was even able to leverage a few web views I had made previously from a class with a similar project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Ionic is such a young framework, I certainly ran up against it's bugs and limitations, but I'm positive I would not have been able to complete two fully functional mobile apps on android and iOS, along with a backend, in this span of time, had I gone the native route. That being said, due to time and cost constraints, the app is currently only deployed to the android app store and not iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges I faced dealt mostly with time constraints and feature creep. The more I got into the app, the more features I wanted to implement, but I had less and less time to do it in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the biggest project I've ever built all on my own. It was daunting at times, especially being a new developer, but over the last few months I just kept chipping away at it, feature by feature, and It's been really exciting to see most of it come together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Idaho Think Tank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take over the world? No, first things first. We&rsquo;re going to focus on features. Lots of features. The trick up our sleeve is also our direct connection to our users. What other platform has a feedback channel built into itself? Our users are ultimately going to be the ones that decide what Idaho Think Tank will become.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And for starters, there's a handful of features we know need to get done:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Nested comments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Email notifications and updates when there is activity with your ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        iOS release.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Private Ideas - It'd be easy to leverage the idea model and set-up a private idea repo/to-do list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build up the user profiles and add things like the ability to "follow"/"friend" other users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hosting images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finalize sponsored ideas or nail down our profit model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leaderboards and Rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Social login integration and ability to share on social networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improve analytics on Idea Statistics view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SO much more...
