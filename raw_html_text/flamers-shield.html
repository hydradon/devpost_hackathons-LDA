                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large proportion of comments posted on the internet tend to be positive and can be described as constructive, but there is a small proportion of them could be considered toxic. And this is a severe problem because being on the internet could help anonymity, and that helps people be even more toxic than usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As people who enjoy videogames, this toxic behaviour is very disruptive and may prevent you from enjoying your game.

                    This project predicts the probability of a comment being one of the following labels:

                    The main steps can be simplified in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Text preprocessing: Several preprocessing techniques have been applied and its output will be used to train the model. In order to do so, Python was used as the main framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modelling: A GLM and a 2RNN+CNN have been implemented. In this case, R was used.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we needed to find a dataset that contains many labelled examples. In this case, the Kaggle dataset
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    has been used. Also, the text preprocessing techniques have been quite difficult as we were not familiar with this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we had to select the models. We wanted something that we were not really familiar with, and for this reason, we chose the aforementioned ones.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Obtaining a final good model that is capable of classifying the comments and achieving an AUC of 
0.984 in the Kaggle ranking.
