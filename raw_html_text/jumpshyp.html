                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember the certain airlines company who's stock plummeted after a certain PR disaster? It would've been really nice to sell before that happened...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine being one of the first people to realize that the public is turning against a company you have a vested interest in, or imagine being one of the first people to see a positive wave of support for a company you are interested in investing in. Simply enter your phone number and company info, and receive text notifications if the companies Twitter sentiment 'velocity' passes a positive or negative threshold. You will be sent a text notifying you of the rapid rise in velocity as well as a link to view a simple webpage with stock information and a news feed of the company!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used tweepy python library for twitter streaming, twillio for text messaging, flask for serving web content, and mongo for storing phone numbers.
