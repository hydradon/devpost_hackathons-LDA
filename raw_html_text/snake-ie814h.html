                            The real struggle came with sending, receiving, and synchronizing data between any number of clients as well as the server. All this has to happen several times a second to maintain a usable performance, without overloading our server and causing latency as more and more users join.

                        Snake is wildly simple game, but throughout development we came up with so many fun ideas and cool things we could put into this game. Multiplayer snake opens up a lot of doors.
