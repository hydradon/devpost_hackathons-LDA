                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that despite many technical advances in our society, a secure and viable way to connect producers and consumers was still needed. From tackling the technical and logistical issue that arise from such technologies, create a smart and tamper-proof blockchain, we solved the issue of tracking and openness across borders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By building a custom blockchain, integrated with high levels of security and reliability, transactions between every link in the supply chain are thoroughly recorded and checked for accuracy. When a producer wishes to sell his products, he will record them on this ledger, which will be publicly available for any individual or company to reference. As consumers and corporations get smarter, more information on products will become increasingly important, this breakthrough technology will allow us to understand how and where our produce comes from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had to learn what a blockchain is on a technical level, and how it could be used to our advantage. We then did trials runs on a very basic level, then started adding features based on what necessities arose. After implementing the blockchain, we used Python and RESTful API services to complete the backend. We used Angular4 with Material Design to tie in the front end.
                </p>

                    Understanding blockchain and then collaborating efficiently with our teammates.
