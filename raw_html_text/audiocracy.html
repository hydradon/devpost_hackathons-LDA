                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is majorly aggravating to push your way through a party just to make a song request at the DJ booth. Now there's an app for that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Audiocracy allows the host or DJ at a party to tailor a playlist to recommendations of partygoers in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, the host chooses a song on our Host page, which is used to create a 'radio' filled with similar songs. From there, the host recieves a unique Event Key for the event. The Event Key can be shared with party-goers, and then entered on our Guest page to connect them to the event's playlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once connected, guests can make suggestions and requests, which are factored into Audiocracy's ranking algorithm. The most-requested songs and artists will be played more often, so your guests can hear the music they actually want to dance to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TL;DR: Magic.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end: HTML, CSS (bootstrap framework), some Javascript
Back end: Javascript, JQuery)

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MANY API problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually managed to get it to seed playlists! It took around 5 hours for our back-end people to figure that out, and we were so happy for them once they did it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can learn a lot, even from a seemingly over-ambitious project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Audiocracy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more back-end functionality, so that the event keys actually work! More testing, and more demos, ability to add songs live to a new playlist rather than just playing directly the generated radio, which needs to be refreshed each time someone adds a new song.
