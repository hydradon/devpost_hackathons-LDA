                    One of the greatest challenges during a large scale, dynamically changing emergency is the dissemination of accurate, up-to-date information to the masses in a quick and efficient way.  The ability to transmit this information without risking manpower, resources or expending extra time is an additional concern. Our team has leveraged existing technologies to solve this problem by creating flexible, lightweight digital bracelets that can receive real time news via wi-fi. The bracelets will be ultra thin, include reflective material to aid in search and rescue, solar panels to recharge as needed, act as repeaters to extend the network, and of course, provide valuable news to citizens in a targeted manner. Pedestrians can receive bracelets in an emergency in two ways, either on-demand via air drop, sea or land delivery, or by accessing pre-placed receptacles in their communities. The ability for first responders to tightly control the flow of information will also allow for better resource allocation, such as traffic control, to prevent shelter overflow, etc. In addition, this singular news feed will allow all responding government departments to see in real time the information the public is receiving. We see further future commercial applications in school settings for active shooter scenarios, concert and sporting events for crowd control, trade show and conventions for scheduling and event information, novelty and branding items, party favors, and more.
