                        The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. This project utilizes an ensemble of the fully convolutional neural networks (CNN) for segmentation of gliomas and its constituents from MRI.

                            The application was developed using various opensource tools, the details can be found in the repository readme, here we made use of PyTorch the process of development involved various iterations, PyTorch provided the ability for quick prototyping and development of deep learning models.

                            The data loader and data augmentation tools provided by torch and torchvision were used in training pipeline, the easy integration of these tools with our pipeline helped us in the developing better tool for tumor segmentation.

                            The proposed ensemble comprises of 3 networks, two 3-D and one 2-D network. Of the 3 networks, 2 of them (one 2-D &amp; one 3-D) utilize dense connectivity patterns while the other 3-D network makes use of the residual connection.

                            Additionally, a 2-D fully convolutional semantic segmentation network was trained to distinguish between air, brain, and lesion in the slice and thereby localize the lesion in the volume. Lesion localized by the above network is multiplied with the segmentation mask generated by the ensemble to reduce false positives.

                            With the proposed technique we achieve the dice of 0.89 0.76, 0.76 on the whole tumor, tumor core and active tumor respectively. In this, we also provide the technique for uncertainty estimation, both model and data uncertainty which helps radiologists in making better decisions.
