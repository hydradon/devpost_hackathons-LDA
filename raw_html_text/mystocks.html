                    Inspiration-I, Shivaansh Kapoor, am Co-President of Wilcox Investments Club, and I wanted to combine my passions for economics and computer science, which lead me to make MyStocks.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- MyStocks functions as a great educational platform for new stock traders, by giving them tips and tricks and keeping track of the live graph. It starts off with a home website and navigation bar, which has five links or separate websites. These links are home, articles, submit an article, video tutorials made by my school's club, and a market calculator.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- I built it using html, Css, and bootstrap to do the front end designing and used java script and jquery to get a live graph to show up.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- My biggest challenge was the submit an article page, since I wanted an input box to be sent straight to my email by using PHP. After 5 hours of research, PHP was not working at all since I needed to install an Apache and email server to store the email in. Since this did not work, I resorted to using HTML and JS to make the program execute the same essential command, but with one extra step, but it made it much more reliable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- I am proud of MyStocks itself since I believe with a little more time put into it, it can really help new stock traders and kick start their investing career. I am also proud of the live graph and the potential that it holds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- I learnt different applications of Java Script and how many things JS can do. I also learnt how much trouble it could be to run PHP or languages like it without being familiar with them. Lastly, I learnt bootstrap as well to make my front end look better.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyStocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to make a server that has API for how fast the market is growng and put it on a live graph which updates live every second or so. I also need to work on some aesthetics and front end to make it look more appealing.
