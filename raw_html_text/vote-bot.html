                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VoteBot aims to increase civic engagement by providing voters with information about which congressional district they are located in and who their candidates are. Especially for first-time voters or people who are unfamiliar with the voting process, sorting through information about candidates can seem overwhelming and discourages many people from voting. VoteBot's simple, user-friendly chat function simplifies access to this information and gives every voter the knowledge they need to go to the polls!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VoteBot interprets a user's query and returns information about their congressional district and candidates for the 2018 Midterm elections.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used webscraper.io to extract information about each candidate from ballotpedia.com. We also created an SQL database that maps a user's zip code to their congressional district and candidates for congress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extracting the data was a challenge, as all of the web pages were formatted slightly differently, especially for states with multiple congressional districts compared to states with only one at-large district. Although we were able to successfully create the SQL database, we were unable to link it to the chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask VoteBot to tell you about a candidate, and it actually will!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web scraping, SQL database collection, working with Dialogflow, and how many caffeinated chocolates we can safely ingest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vote Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, VoteBot would be able to use a phone or computer's internal location services to generate a likely estimate for a person's congressional district. We would also have the bot automatically search the SQL database without the user having to specifically format their query. Given more time, we would add a feature so that users can ask about candidates' views on particular issues and search for candidates by issue.
