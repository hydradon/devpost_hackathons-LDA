                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've done a lot of work in Excel in the past, and I was always happy when I could automate some part of it with VBA. But VBA can also be used in creative ways. I have been wanting to make a game in Excel for some time, so this was a prime opportunity to devote some time to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It just plays a game of Pong in an Excel spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With pain and suffering. (Had to relearn VBA)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relearning VBA, differences between pixel size and point size in the application window. Logical errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Maily the bouncing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Plan these things out better.

                <p>
                    Maybe adding some actual key functionality.
