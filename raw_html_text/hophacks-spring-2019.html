                    This is a web app to help new college students get adjusted to their new environment.  The flagship feature is a custom page with all the clubs and student organizations the college offers with filtering abilities.  Additionally this page has a calculator to help students adjust the time they spend on studying, having fun with time with friends, etc. as well as a chatbot to help any users navigate the site.

                    The club information was gathered by a python parser that we built with Beautiful Soup and Selenium and ran it on

                    .  The parser stored the data into a SQL lite database.  We then built a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Flask and integrated the database into the website.  Finally, the calculator was built using HTML input components and javascript and the chatbot was created using DialogFlow.

                    Our biggest issue when creating this project was training the chatbot.  Originally, we were planning to build a chatbot using Python and NLTK or Chatterbot.  After a few hours we realized that building a chatbot oriented webapp was unfeasible and had to re-evaluate our goals and refocus our project.
