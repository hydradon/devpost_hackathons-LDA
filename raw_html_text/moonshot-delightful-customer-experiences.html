                    All the current trends point back to the end users&rsquo; demands for better user experiences. They want faster, smarter applications that are easy to use and pleasing to look at.

                <p>
                    Our project aims at delivering this ultimate customer experience for the financial industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our users will be delighted using a state of the art, easy to navigate web site with a build-in chat bot for fully automated, 24/7 customer support, including the first-of-its-kind consumer finance automation to provide immediate response and personalized offers, supported by a decoupled back-end business rules service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience is fully optimized for existing customers to avoid information duplication. This will be accomplished through a tight integration with a CRM back-end based on Microsoft Dynamics.

                    Today, customers are rightfully concerned about security. To address this concern, the web site will also offer a secure, but easy to use loan documentation upload function, leveraging a secure file transfer and storage technology.
And off course, to make sure that customers can interact with systems on a 24x7 basis, the back-end infrastructure will be continuously monitored for up-time and quality of service.
