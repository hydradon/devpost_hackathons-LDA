                    These days if you buy a $150 worth product from the supreme website, you can resale the product with at least $300 or more. Within the high demands, it is important to buy as soon as possible than any others. Thus, we used an ios-application, python, and firebase to build a software that can help any supreme resalers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we used python and Beautiful Soup4 library to data scrap from the website and used the html to parse the important information from the website. Then we connected the python with Firebase to update the database to check the availability of the product every second. (The reason we updated our Firebase every second is to keep up stock decreasing quickly). Thus python code will be working as the home server of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we used the firebase as our database to keep all the url and the stock (if its out of stock or not) into the database. It was possible for us to link the ios application to the firebase, so as python code. both of them grab the data from the firebase to update and edit database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, we used an ios application as a user interface to input the proper url link to the text field and grab the proper data from the Firebase to check the availability of the product. Also if the product is not in the Database, we updated our database to keep up with new product (that user has input)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it was a challenging project because we wanted to use the Firebase which we haven't used before; however thanks to HackPSU, we were manage to work through the problems in every direction to overcome the problem.
