                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is the one thing that LA is most notorious for? Fame? Food? Overly priced university? No. Its god awful traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When brainstorming for ideas about how we could positively impact LA, it's traffic was the clear issue that needed solving. However, this is a hackathon and we have 36 hours. Therefore, there was no chance of us solving traffic. We decided to make the traffic less impactful on people's day-to-day lives.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FastTrack watches your Google Calendar for updates. Every time it detects one, it runs through an algorithm to detect predicted travel times between each event. If, based on historical traffic data, it looks like it'll be impossible to get to an event in time, it'll alert you and encourage you to reschedule if possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built FastTrack using Node.js on StdLib. This allowed us to create our own API, which can be used to easily manipulate data. Our API is called using webhooks whenever the user makes changes in their Google Calendar. It then checks whether it's possible to travel between each event in the time given (taking into account of historical traffic data). If it's not, it will send a notification to the user via Twillio API.
