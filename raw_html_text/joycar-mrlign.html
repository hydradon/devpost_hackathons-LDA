                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from a recent bank robbery in our home town, Pleasanton. The robbers hijacked a car near the bank, never to return. We wanted to design an app that would ensure security and reduce the risk of stolen cars. This allows for an efficient and safer driving experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app, JoyCar, is designed with four features: Touch ID, Face ID, Location, and Emergency Contact. Our app is centered around our Touch ID, enabling the user to unlock their car with their fingerprint. Everyone's fingerprint is unique, therefore reduces the risk of your car getting stolen and allows for a safer driving experience. The Face ID feature is mainly built in for phones without a Touch ID, such as the iPhone X. This function is quite similar to the Touch ID, as everyone does not have the same face. Our next feature is the location feature. If a car is stolen or lost, the app will track your car and provide directions to that location with the GPS that is on the car. If needed, the app takes a screenshot that would be sen tot he police, showing where the car has traveled. Our last feature is an emergency contact that is directed to 911; this being a way to ensure privacy and rule out the possibilities of stolen cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built the IOS app using the Apple programming language Swift and it's compiler XCODE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team ran experienced a variety of challenges in creating this project. First of all, none of our team members had previously used Swift or programmed an IOS app, so it was difficult to familiarize ourselves with the new language and layout within 24 hours. Another challenge was learning and understanding the multiple aspects of XCODE in order to perform the actions we wished to perform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammates are especially proud of the location feature that allows us to track our car. We also learned to use an unfamiliar programming language within a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our project, we gained a better understanding of the Swift language and its capabilities. During 24 hours, we were able to adapt ourselves to a whole new language and challenging ourselves through this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JoyCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have the opportunity to connect the app to an actual car and add more features to ensure the safety of our vehicles.
