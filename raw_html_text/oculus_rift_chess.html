                    Motivation and Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the opportunity to work with amazing hardware-so why shouldn&rsquo;t we?
We have the time and all our energy is  dedicated to make dreams a virtual reality-so why shouldn&rsquo;t we?
We want to teach the future-so why shouldn&rsquo;t we?
Chess is stimulating, peaceful and a social game all in one. Yet many do not know rules of this game, and that is why we came up with this idea in order to teach the world the basic rules through an interesting and  immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dive into the game or fly high, it is your choice! As you glide along, each of the pieces&rsquo; information will rise above you. Immerse yourself in this teaching device inspired by Harry Potter. You will stand beside the king or as the ruler of them all, you choose.

                    Impact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. With the help of cutting-edge technology such as Alienware and Oculus Rift, today you can experience firsthand the premier board game of the Harry Potter world: wizard's chess.
There are many different types of stress relievers: gaming is one of them. Yet so many do not have the opportunity to learn. They need a teacher beside them. But here, they will be able to look at all of the pieces and get a grasp of the board. Note: due to time shortage we were not able to implement the game logic.  In fact, this is a board game turned video game, because now, the player is inside the game! They will  learn to appreciate the individual characters and their nuances more because they will be face to face with the pieces. But don&rsquo;t worry, it is not weird because there is no conversation.

                <h2>
                    Technical Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Alienware  as our computing platform since it was VR ready and had the required software tools like Unity,Steam VR and Oculus Rift application.We created the game model using Unity and implemented logic for the board using C# on Monodevelop. We made the program usable for the Oculus Rift to create a truly immersive experience. We used online resources like stackoverflow and documentations,official discussion forums on the unity website to look for fixes and development.

                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this process we faced a number of challenges. Like the fact that most of the group had never used Unity before. And no one had coded in C# before yesterday. We often got stuck because there was not as much support for Unity on Oculus Rift as we would like. We literally spent hours trying to figure out how to effectively leverage the input controls and determine collision between the game objects. But luckily, through the help of mentors, peers, and our knowledge of java we were able to model the initial design and player movement on the rift.

                <h2>
                    Future Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time&hellip;
We, unfortunately, we not able to fully implement the Wizarding Chess that we wanted to. So in the future, we would design our own pieces instead of downloading them off the Internet. We would fully implement the logic and an AI so that if the player so chooses he or she can play against themselves or another person. We would decorate the scene with Harry Potter memorabilia and create an intro scene where we would write &ldquo;Wizarding Chess of Harry Potter&rdquo; in that font, which would then fly off to reveal the board. We would allow the people to be of different heights depending on the characters; indeed, if they die the game also would end. They would have one view, that of the piece  they had chosen. We would allow many players to play in teams. When one item would try to kill another item, we would have a mini game: the winner survives, and the loser dies. The commands would be given using the Microsoft API from speech to text.  And so we would try create harry potter, with a twist.
