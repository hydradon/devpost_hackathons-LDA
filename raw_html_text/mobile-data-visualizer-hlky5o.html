                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These days most of us are carrying a smartphone in our pockets. These are full of sensors, able to get astounding amount of information and constantly connected to the Internet. Seeing the
                    <strong>
                        huge dataset
                    </strong>
                    with this kind of information at our hands in the beginning of the weekend, we couldn't help but to explore it. What interesting facts would it hide?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step into understanding data is
                    <strong>
                        visualization
                    </strong>
                    .  With hundreds of thousands of observations, the dataset includes the geolocation of every single one of them. So we decided to project the information into a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a website that provides a beautiful and simple interface to visualize some of the many interesting points from the carrier dataset. How was the signal strength? Was the person moving? At what speed? Using what kind of transport? These and a few more questions are answered in our visualization. Furthermore, the information is divided by months and can be split for each of the major carriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each user is represented by a circle. By default, there are many colors; each one represents a carrier. The more intense is the color, the more intense is their signal. Click on a circle and get clear-cut information as the exact coordinates.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to manage tons of data on a feasible time for the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of having finished a polished interface to interact with such a vast dataset being a rather small team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remarkably being able to manage huge amounts of data in a feasible time for a virtual web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mobile Data Visualizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step to improve our website would be digging deeper into representing new things in new ways to show other interesting user/carrier information.
