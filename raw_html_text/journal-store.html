                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want the uploader to be able to store journals permanently with low cost, and enable the uploader to have the option of collecting payment from readers in an efficient way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Journals are uploaded by the uploader (author) to the blockchain in Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), which is stored permanently with little one-shot cost. Uploader has the option to make it free or with charge, in the latter case, LUNO system will be adapted and BTC &amp; ETH payments are available for the readers to pay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by analysing the (blockchain -&gt; information) translation mechanism, followed by integrating such mechanism into our website, making a user-friendly form for uploader and readers to enjoy. Then, we integrate LUNO's pricing information in, and relate the payment option open for further integration with LUNO wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The translation mechanism was hard to understand, and take, despite worthy, a huge amount of time. The payment button was a bit troublesome as well, but more or less an HTML issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are one of the first few permanent data depository using blockchain, and probably the first ever journal (text-level) depository using blockchain. BlockJournal is also a vivid example as an extensive usage of LUNO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is definitely crucial. The understanding of the translation mechanism may be solved by smarter ways, and a better understanding on what LUNO could offer should be done at the first stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlockJournal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A revised version with legal and filtering mechanisms should be available, followed by further payment integration with LUNO.
