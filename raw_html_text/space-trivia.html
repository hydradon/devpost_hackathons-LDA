                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a child, I had always been fascinated by the universe, solar system and planets which is why I chose to build this skill for children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space Trivia is to gain knowledge about Universe, galaxies and much more in a fun and interactive manner.
The children play quiz and level up when they give the answer correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build the app using Node.js and uploaded the code to AWS-Lambda function. I have also used AWS-DynamoDB to store the user level and stage they are at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge for me to know how to make an interactive skill in which the responses go in a to and fro motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I successfully published this application on my first try itself.
This will help kids greatly to learn new things in a fun way and hence boosting their confidence, nurturing them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to integrate DynamoDB into my Alexa skill, making an interactive voice-based application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to add music and sounds in the application to make the user experience even better and more friendly to encourage the children to play with it more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with it I'll also increase the number of questions in the database.
