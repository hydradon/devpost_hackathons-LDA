                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the presented NRC challenge to come up with a tech solution to enable tracking of House Rental Contracts done by people in Jordan.
Currently many of the contracts are done verbally, which makes almost impossible for NRC to mediate in favour of either the Tenant or the Landlord when disputes take place.
To facilitate NRC mediation, a digital platform to track the House Rental Contracts is necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MVP of the NRC "Safe Night Rest" is a mobile website enabling both Tenants and Landlords to compose House Rental Contracts and to detail the agreement between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contracts done in the website are not legally binging but just for NRC to tract the agreement between both parties.
The idea of the app is not to track the negotiation between Tenant and Landlord but to record its outcome, specially the responsibilities of each party regarding the House under rental.
The app emphasises two aspects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        flexible contracts, tailored together by Tenants and Landlords to their needs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        accessibility services, for people not able to read or write (in this regards, at least one person needs to know how to use the app)
This way both of them can tailor the contract on the flight.
Another key aspect of the NRC is that both parties (Tenant and Landlord ) have to approve the contract.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time and resource constraint, this MVP of the NRC "Safe Night Rest" app is a mockup detailing the user interactions.
Since the requirements were narrowed down to its MVP in the hackathon, using the mockup it's now possible to code the solution.
The presented mockup simulates a user interacting with the NRC app and another user receiving a contract to sign.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part of the challenge was to shape the first MVP, then it was out of reach to code a part of the solution.
Also, since the skills of the team were quite diverse, it was very hard to code an actual solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We debated and come up with a first MVP, yuhuu!!
Even more, we designed together a mockup of the MVP to be used for the coding project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about the housing problem in Jordan and what are its main challenges.
We knew cool people, which is great!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take the mockup and code the actual app.
Put the app to work and see how it goes.
Eventually augment the platform by adding more services on top.
