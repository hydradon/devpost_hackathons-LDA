                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have no memory for faces. This can make remembering the names of new people rather difficult. For the blind or those at conferences, or if you just generally have a poor memory like me, Whispr is a pair of glasses utilizing image recognition and machine learning to recognize your friends, find their internet presences, and provide a little extra info for the curious. Whispr is a unique personal assistance device meant to aid in the speedy recognition of those around you and help you socialize smoothly. Whispr is a cloud solution for blindness and prosopagnosia.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whispr is a camera, currently integrated into a pair of sunglasses, connected to a portable raspberry pi that can take and process images of people around you and let you know who they are through a pair of headphones connected to the pi, or through the watch app we built.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pi is running a python server to take requests for new images and send the images to our server for processing and recognition, then receive a voice files from AWS Polly and Rekognition and read them back to the user. We also built a Pebble watch app to trigger new images and display a list of the people you've seen recently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    acebook has no api for their facial recognition. AWS refused to approve our account for around 12 hours.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    Unless I break it in the next two hours, it works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built custom apis for facebook and linkedin.
A fair bit about using AWS to build microservices within your project. How to create a fake facebook api and emulate refresh tokens.

                    What's next for Messenger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of Whispr hardware in a variety of other functional and fashionable ways to recognize your surroundings, such as a ties and handbags. More robust representations of information, reduced roundtrip on new image requests. All this will come together to make Whispr better than Google Glass.
