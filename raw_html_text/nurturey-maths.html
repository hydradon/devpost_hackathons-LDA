                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My 8-year-old son. And how I help him practice mental maths with him in the car during school runs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asks mental maths questions to kids via Alexa. Manages their response. Questions are capability/level appropriate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During design, I kept asking my son to use the skill. I identified how a young kid will interact and what will he expect from Alexa during the conversation. His expectations were different to those of adults. That's how we fine-tuned the communication capability of the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing new skill sets to design communication with Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son loves the product. He is in the demo video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa skills can be built with capability to manage conversations - end to end - even with a child
                </p>
