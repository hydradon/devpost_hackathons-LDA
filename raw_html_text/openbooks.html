                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to do a project that has not been done, as well as connect people to the things that they support. We decided our best option was creating a free, open-source, web app for charities and donors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app allows charities to use the platform as a bookkeeping service, while donors would be granted a new view into the charities activities and use of the donations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-boilerplate as a launching platform for our app, giving us the scalability, and modularity necessary to create an app capable of growth. Our backend was Springboot, which removes the need for us to create our own boilerplate code. It also gave us relational-mapping, auto-generated swagger, and the ability to hit the ground running with our plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this Hackathon rusty with our React skills caused an initial block in our development process. We were able to move forward with a slightly modified plan that would still be able to showcase our apps intention and ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team. Our design. Ourselves. Some functionality in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React, api connection problem-solving, pagination, sorting, and swagger within Springboot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OpenBooks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is increased functionality for all users of the platform. Revisiting the plan we came into this project with to make sure we are utilizing all libraries we wanted to, to their fullest ability.
