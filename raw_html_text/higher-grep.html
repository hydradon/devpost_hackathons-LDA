                    I usually tend to loathe the quality of any of my codes that are more than a couple of weeks old. In some of them, the problem has a consistent pattern. I wanted to write a script that changed those chunks of code to a better one. Ctrl-F however, is too dump of a way to handle this task. What if, without worrying about the details, one could declaratively state what is it that one is trying to search and get back a location of all the chunks that matches the criteria?
