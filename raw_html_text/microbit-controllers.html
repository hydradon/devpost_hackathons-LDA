                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The micro controllers seemed like interesting hardware to work on. Hence, we decided quite quickly to work with these. After that we thought about a project and came up with the idea to combine it with the Morgan Stanley Challenge. We thought it would be interesting to implement a multiplayer game on the computer and use the micro controllers to play against each other.  This ended in us producing a fully fledged library. This library is versatile and currently allows sending button presses and accelerometer information.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three micro controllers. One acts as kind of a server. The other two are the actual controllers. The &lsquo;server&rsquo; is connected to the computer where the actual game runs on. The two other micro controllers talk to the &lsquo;server&rsquo; and through that to the computer. We have implemented two retro games, namely Pong and a kind of multiplayer snake. Those are started at the computer and then each &lsquo;player&rsquo; is controlled by one of the mini controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with focussing on the connection between the different micro controllers (via radio) and connection between the &lsquo;server&rsquo;-microcontroller and the laptop (via uart-serial). After that we built the pong game on the computer. For the game, we decided to use &lsquo;pygame&rsquo; library since the rest of our project was already written in python.  After we finished the implementation we integrated the controls via the micro controllers. For steering the pong &lsquo;bat&rsquo; we used the accelerometer of the micro controllers. Since everything was working well together we decided to program another game which is a kind of multiplayer snake. This time we used the Buttons &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; to steer. In the end, we put everything together and did some fine tuning.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The connection between the &lsquo;server&rsquo;-micro controller turned out to be quite challenging and took a lot of effort. Eventually, we got it to work even though we had to deal with the loss of some packages. This made the controls of the second game a bit laggy from time to time but overall we were satisfied with them.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to do everything we planned to and with the second game even more. We finished in time and learned a lot.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It differs from person to person but overall we developed our knowledge in python and also in working with hardware which was definitely a lot of fun.

                    What's next for Microbit controllers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The controllers can be used for other games as well. These two games are just an example of what they can do.
