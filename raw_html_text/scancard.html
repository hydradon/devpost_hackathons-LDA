                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we meet with our sponsors, we always collect a lot of business cards. However, it is time-consuming to add them one-by-one to the contacts, and we might also make some mistakes when entering their information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to develop an APP that can add contacts without entering information. What customer needs to do is to open the APP and scan the business card. It will automatically input the information to the contacts and add the person you want to connect to.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    A lot. We learned how to implement the Google Cloud API under the android studio.

                    What's next for ScanCard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to create contacts for this APP. Moreover, we would like to use this APP to generate your own business card in a different way; for instance, we would like to generate a QR code for each customer, and by scanning this QR code we can just add him/her to contacts.
