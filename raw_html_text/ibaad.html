                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With so many people asking for help and a very charitable country, it was very common get requests managed organically between communities, whatsapp groups with private payment information of do-gooders. We wanted to streamline the process of giving donations and collecting them thus ibaad.org was born
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows for anyone to nominate a beneficiary. After review and approval anyone can fund and get updates on the case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Wordpress baseline package and modified it to our needs as well as adding local payment integration APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding credible beneficiaries. A trust network works such that if my friend knows someone in need and I want to give charity, I will donate without questions asked. However, the trust network usually doesn't know a lot about the beneficiary for example: what is the specific name of the disease, who is the doctor, is this a legitimate expense?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built and launched the damn thing in two days. Including getting a bank account and payment system up and running
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned interesting things such as: most of the charity cases being referred to us were about people in poverty without the means to support large families yet have 5-7 children. It's a miserable state for the children to be in and the parents want the children to work and earn for them. There needs to be a long term solution for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ibaad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're unsure but we know we want to keep this a Public Benefit Corporation. We want this to be run by volunteers but still have teeth. We might need to go into a vertical such as a Education but right now we're open to all
