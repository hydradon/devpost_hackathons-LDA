                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something relevant to the security theme and also wanted to dabble in new technologies and frameworks we've never used. We attended the
                    <code>
                        MongoDB
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        NodeJS
                    </code>
                    workshop and decided we would use these technologies in our hack since we had little to no experience with them. Due to the obvious time constraints of the hackathon, we kept our idea small and went with a password phrase generator and manager in light of Stony Brook's update on switching to pass phrases for NET IDs instead of passwords.

                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Generates unique password phrases (given a keyword and length option) and stores them in a database (MongoDB).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculates the individual and average strength of each password using an algorithm that measures its entropy or randomness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Handles logins via Google Passport Authentication so users can see their pass phrases.

                        We also used
