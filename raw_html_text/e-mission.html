                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change sucks. Also environmentalism has been growing at Imperial (with the implementation of Meat-Free Mondays) so we thought this would catch students' attention.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Calculates the carbon and water footprint of foods from a photo and returns a score to help you understand it

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    With great difficulty

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being chemists we had to learn how to develop the front-end on the job
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accessing tables with nested loops is hard when you have 3 variables to match with
                </p>

                    The database indexing was a success. "I made a code!!" -Andy
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made a thing!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are more resilient than we thought. If chemists can do it then it can't be that hard
                </p>

                    What's next for e-Mission

                <p>
                    Implementation throughout the whole database and adding more food items to the databases. Training the AI to recognise more food items.
