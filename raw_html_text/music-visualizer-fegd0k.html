                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like music and we're also visual people! Worked on a couple projects and got bored when they were done, so this came to mind!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes LEDs react to the music you're listening to!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an Arduino and a Spectrum Shield, we're able to read music from our media devices and control an LED strip to showcase what our music LOOKS like.
                </p>

                    Too many to talk about in here haha

                    What's next for Music Visualizer

                <p>
                    Making new settings and getting a better power supply so we can make use of the full LED strip and even multiple strips
