                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In hospital inpatient situations, patients often feel frustration due to lack of attention they receive, as the ratio of medical professionals and those admitted in hospital leans heavily in favor of patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, patients are rarely adequately-sufficiently educated of medical and hospital process. Uncertainty during their stay also negatively affects patient&rsquo;s experience during hospitalization by making them feel lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a communication system for patients to update their health care professionals of changes in their physical and emotional state during their inpatient stay when their health care professionals are not immediately available. This information is then delivered to the provider is a quick visual format, allowing the limited time spent between providers and patients to be more productive. The tool always patients to feel like they are having an individualized hospital experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and javascript to develop the web app. Preact (a lightweight alternative of Facebook's ReactJS) and JQuery were used to draw the UI. We also built our own server in Node to respond to POST requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our challenges were the lack of experience of our teammates in different programming languages- we overcame this in true hack-a-thon format- by learning on the go! Also we had difficulty with learning the backend side of developing- making the database to store patient information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make this project multifaceted, having not only patient and nurse interfaces, but also having multiple functionalities for the patients, and multiple ways of viewing the data for the nurses. We also learned a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, our experience level greatly varied. Some members of our team got to learn a lot about javascript, html, css. Another member was able to greatly improve upon their backend programming skills. Much of the team also learned about the hospital experience from both the patient and healthcare professional side through interacting with people who worked day to day in the clinical hospital setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for healthCares
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop the 'Hospitalization Information' functionality of the app further, so that patients can receive test results, information about diagnoses, and explanations of procedures they will undergo to further increase patient satisfaction by minimizing confusion about the care they are receiving.
