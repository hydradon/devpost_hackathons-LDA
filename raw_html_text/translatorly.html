                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When learning a new language it's important to integrate it into your life as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translatorly integrates language learning into your life by replacing some words in your mother tongue into words in a language you want to learn. There are 3 levels of difficulty for the user to choose, the more difficult the user chooses, the more words Translatorly replaces, so the user is exposed to a bigger vocabulary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tools we used include Bash, JavaScript, HTML and Chrome Extension. We first needed to target only the texts on a webpage. Then we needed to search and replace the desired words with words in another language. To allow translation, we found word lists of different sizes online and translated them into a target language(French and Chinese in our case). We then use Bash to parse and generate pairs of translations for our program to use. We also allowed the change of target language and difficulty in the option page of Translatorly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us knew JavaScript or HTML well. We had to pick them up very quickly. We also had to find a way to generate word pairs quickly as we had thousands of them. Machine translations are not very accurate so we limited our word lists to contain only nouns.
                </p>
