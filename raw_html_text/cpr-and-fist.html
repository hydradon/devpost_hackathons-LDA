                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, there are not many free stock trading prediction algorithms for intraday and short-term trading. In order to make one accesible to the public, we created a user friendly platform that predicts and suggests BUY-SELL-HOLD signals for publicly traded securities in NYSE and NASDAQ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our back-end performs financial analysis and trend analysis on each equity and uses a weighted-average rating system to predict whether to BUY, SELL, or HOLD a particular stock. The financial analysis includes calculating the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, SMA-Crossover, among others. The results are stored in a database and displayed on a website with a clean user-interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end prediction algorithm is written using Python. The historical data of each stock and the ratings are stored in MongoDB. Flask, Node.js, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap is used to present the data from MongoDB in a seamless interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into slight problems while using Flask and JavaScript. The problems were solved quickly. The project went smoothly due to the efficiency of all team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our prediction algorithm was a complete success. We were also able to successfully populate tables in our front end from our database. These tables display our predictions in a clean fashion. We were able to create a free real-time stock graph for users (real-time price feeds cost upwards of $500 per month)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about full-stack development after working with a back-end Python code, using Flask to submit GET and POST requests, using MongoDB to store data, using NodeJS/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap to create a front-end web application to present the contents of the database. We also learned how to take a very complex idea with many moving parts and allow them to communicate and work with each other.
