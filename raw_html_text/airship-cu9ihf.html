                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's fast-paced society, it's a hassle to have to exchange contact information for every single file transfer between people's devices. Standard file transfer systems are flawed: email, text, or messaging is inconvenient and timely, Android NFC is clunky and unwieldly, and although Apple's AirDrop is streamlined and simple, it is limited to iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if file sharing didn't have to be this complicated? What if you could whip out your phone, and in a couple taps send something to a friend? What if you could send someone a .pdf as quickly as you could hand them a sheet of paper in real life?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    airship is our cross platform file sharing service. It utilizes web based servers and APIs in order to emulate the ease of  Apple's AirDrop, but for any device. When a user opens the web app and connects to our server, their location data is used to see if other users are nearby. Once they are shown other nearby users, they can upload their files and share directly to whichever user they choose. When receiving files, a user is prompted to accept and download it, or deny and ignore it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed airship's front-end using React, and the back-end with Koa and Redis. We did work with APIs in order to add features: Google Cloud Platform for server hosting and Geolocation for locating users. We had React send post requests in order to communicate data between our front and back ends. Finally, our webpage was built with standard HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bridging our front and back ends was a major challenge. None of us had any experience building using React, and trying to figure out how to connect it to our server was a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how far we were able to get with our limited knowledge of React. We learned and built a lot, especially working with APIs to integrate post requests and geolocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all about React, and bridging our front to our back end. As stated above, we learned about post requests and working with React APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for airship
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will complete our bridges between our front and back ends, as both our front and back are workable on their own.
