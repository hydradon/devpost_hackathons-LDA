                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially inspired to create this product, since we, personally, have lots of problems trying to find eco-friendly and easily disposable products for use in college dormitory life. This has been brewing for a while now, and we're glad it finally came to fruition!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches through all online listings and then sorts them firstly by relevance to the query of the product needed by the user. We then crawl through the pages to find certain key words and then rank all products based on a proprietary algorithm developed through self-learning. Our algorithm adapts through the queries that many users end up presenting us and the choices they make. After that, we present the results to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Flask and python to serve the backend, and HTML/CSS for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties with our sorting and learning algorithms. That, combined with the front end, was the hardest part of the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we managed to get this working so quickly and effectively. The accuracy of our search increases with every search!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use some simple machine learning algorithm and big data sorting. We also learned to integrate with many marketplace APIs
                </p>
