                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This favorite toy from long ago had a super simple user interface: point the dial at an animal and pull the string.  The See n&rsquo; Say would say the name of the animal and make the correct animal sound.   However, the original was limited to 12 animals, only spoke English and contained a small record player for containing the fixed recordings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it will do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would attempt to maintain the same great user interface but allow the system to be extendable:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Downloadable learning options: Farm animals, zoo animals, learn numbers, learn to tell time, shapes, colors, common household object.  Essentially, download whatever graphics and sounds are desired to create a new interactive toy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Language flexibility &ndash; we would not limited to English
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Game options to make learning fun like beat the clock, Simon Says, or play against an online friend with a linked See n Say.

                    <li>
                        Servo controlled &ldquo;Dial&rdquo; with encoder to sense position and rotate the dial.  User would use the dial to point to a position, which can be read by the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pushbutton (versus string) &ndash; when the button was pushed, the servo would spin the dial and play correct sounds.

                    How we will build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to the event, we get the hardware together in a box (displays, servo, encoder and various controllers) and a See n&rsquo; Say to gut for the parts.  During the event, we&rsquo;ll need a few sub-teams working on the major areas:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Web system to coordinate information to download (link graphic images and sounds with position)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Displaying the graphics and playing the wave files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting the servo and encoder system working
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Packaging and power distribution
                    </li>
                    It&rsquo;ll be a lot of work but also a lot of fun!!
