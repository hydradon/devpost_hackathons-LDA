                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this hack was to make virtual reality gaming even more immersive.  We love first person shooter games and paintball, and we saw the Google Cardboard as a chance to create this experience in real life.  Imagine being able to play a hardcore game of paintball anytime, anywhere, without the mess.  pARfs strives to make social gaming more immersive by allowing players to compete anywhere!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    pARfs allows social and immersive gaming by allowing users to play an augmented reality first person shooter anytime, anywhere.  It overlays an AR UI onto the camera view and communicates with a custom gun controller and Firebase server.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is designed with Unity3D using the Google Cardboard API for Android.  The custom gun controller is created with Arduino and synched to our Unity3D application to control it.  Furthermore, Unity3D is hooked up to a Firebase API (via the restAPI) to allow multiplayer capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into numerous problems during this hack.  Firstly, we had to use the restAPI and HTTP requests to communicate with Firebase because Unity3D doesn't have a Firebase client.  We also had difficulties creating the custom controllers using IR sensors with a certain amount of accuracy/forgiveness.  Lastly, we had difficulties getting the Arduino to communicate with Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud that we managed to get the Firebase servers working for Unity3D, and that we got all of the parts of the project working together to create an amazing immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Firebase, using external APIs with Unity3D, using SerialPorts in an Android environment, and how to use Arduino to create cool hardware experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for pARfs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to update the gun controller to work with bluetooth for easier integration.  We also plan to release our app on the Android Store for a cool DIY project, open source the project, and make an Instructables of how to make your own gun controller.
