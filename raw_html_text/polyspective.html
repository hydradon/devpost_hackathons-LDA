                    Video editing takes ages to do successfully and tons of manpower. Casual concert-goers or small video creators don't have the time or resources to spend on editing a bunch perspectives together.

                    Perspective is a "hands free" software recording app that will automatically switch cameras based on the activity they are recording. It can be used for live streams, or pre recorded videos. Our software does an entire

                <p>
                    We use a set of different features to look for in a camera's frame, and turn these into scores. We then combine these scores (some weighted different than others) to a final, "activity score". The camera with the highest activity score is the camera selected for input.

                    Here we go...

                        Sometimes our facial recognition software cuts out, so we must interpolate previous frame's data to accommodate for sudden "empty" frames (that aren't really empty).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since we didn't have loads of time to optimize our code, we had to make recording accommodations for the processing time our algorithms take

                            <li>
                                Faces are not always straight. Frames are. We had to write an algorithm to find the tilt of a face, and then neutralize that in our other facial algorithms.
