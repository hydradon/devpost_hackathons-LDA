                    . Over a quarter of a million people die annually due to preventable medical errors - that's 700 deaths a day, or 1 death every two minutes.

                    The Solution

                <p>
                    Our solution was to create an inexpensive solution which could be scaled to the needs of an entire country's medical records and would allow for maximum availability even when under immense usage. The software system would also allow for complex data analytics to be performed, resulting in a significant increase in medical statistics.
