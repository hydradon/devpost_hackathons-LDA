                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its difficult to engage users within an application and Notification Centers are sometimes useful but don't gather enough interaction. I was inspired to create this by FB Messenger the new conversational paradigm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system integrates within the TransAmerica application to offer advice and comments on a user's account. It may alert the user about upcoming charges so they are more aware of their financial decisions or let the user know about current expenditures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It makes it easier for a customer to transfer money between accounts to hopefully build better money habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML and NodeJS I built a simple conversational system that provides a conversational notification center and customer service platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next up I want to implement this application in a native system on both Android and iOS.
