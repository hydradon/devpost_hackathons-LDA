                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were frustrated with the lack of knowledge about recycling. We found that we are not alone and that in fact 1/4 of all waste items which go into recycling are non-recyclables. We conducted research and decided that the best and most engaging way to spread our findings would be to build a chatbot.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the experience smoother, it classifies the material of the object which the user sent us with pretrained classification neural network.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided our tasks into two groups, backend and frontend. The backend focused on using Pytorch to create a machine learning classifier to classify a material. This was aided with transfer learning.
