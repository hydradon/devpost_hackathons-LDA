                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Penn State students and living in a highly advanced technological society, we pursue convenience at its peak. 
Following up with our GPAs and future prospects is one of the crucial college life that we can't lose out and it is quite tiresome to it all the time. So we have come up with the idea of a compact scheduler that one can monitor not only current and future GPAs, but also can monitor which Gen-Ed to fulfill the degree requirement along with exclusive PSU prof. review by comparing "apple points".

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As upper classmen in Penn State, we have felt that that it is quite tiresome checking which Gen-ed courses are required for our majors with right hand, while scrutinizing our printed out degree audit back and forth with other hand. 
Then we said, how about creating an app or a program that allow us to show all of those aforementioned necessary components for students&rsquo; sake. This compact and easy GPA tracking program will relieve burden off students shoulders, because all they have to do is select their majors, and CGV will sort required courses automatically; whether it is GS, GH, or GQ.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ to create a program called pseudo code. If we had enough resources and time we would have utilized Xcode to conjugate an Iphone application. And if successful, we would distribute to PSU students for free.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since PSU has over 160 majors with insurmountable  required courses in each departments, it was quite hard to gather data which is quite behemoth.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are living in 21st century where people pursue quick and concise accommodation, our task as future engineers is to strive forward to make things computerized and very convenient to use. Making things easy to use is what computer science major inspiring us. 
Coming up with this conglomerate GPA scheduler, we can make fellow Penn Staters lives much easier and highly protect their GPAs along with secured future.

                    Even though we are living in technologically advanced world where plethora amount of  new apps or new programs get realized every single day, we had trouble making a simple application. We started to appreciate how hard it is to make a program and can't wait to jump in this field.

                    We are going to sharp our iron to maximize our potential.  If we had enough resources and time we would have utilized Xcode to conjugate an Iphone application. And if successful, we would distribute to PSU students for free.

                    It is evident that as Penn Staters, we are predetermined to check our grades and to blueprint our schedules in order to bring the full potential out of us. Having a college life in PSU in which has over 160 majors could be a quite abstruse to both freshmen and upper class due to complexity and magnitude of its data to be comprehended.
Therefore, our team has come up with a concise and compact scheduler that is consisted of: GPA calculation, GPA prediction, semester planning, left over general education credit calculator and Gen-Ed type classifier, and last but not least daily updated class grades monitor.  Now we introduce CGV, a Compact Grade Verifier.

                    <li>
                        Why did we reach a decision to make CGV?

                </ul>
                <p>
                    As upper classmen in Penn State, we have felt that that it is quite tiresome checking which Gen-ed courses are required for our majors with right hand, while scrutinizing our printed out degree audit back and forth with other hand. 
Then we said, how about creating an app or a program that allow us to show all of those aforementioned necessary components for students&rsquo; sake. This compact and easy GPA tracking program will relieve burden off students shoulders, because all they have to do is select their majors, and CGV will sort required courses automatically; whether it is GS, GH, or GQ.

                        What impacts will CGV upon certain group of people?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As we are notified to craft a program that can benefit certain group of people, we narrowed it down the focus to Penn State students. Our jobs as being students can be vigorous. Our main keyword was &ldquo;convenience&rdquo;. It is true that majority of students check their professors online, such as ratemyprofessor.com or koofers, to figure out his or her teaching methods and styles for preparation. Then we thought what about creating PSU&rsquo;s own rating system that required to login with an actual PSU account but can write anonymously to evade privacy issues. Or simply show reviews from Student Rating of Teaching Effectiveness (SRTE) points indicating teaching styles &ldquo;apple points&rdquo; to help upcoming students and current students. Overall, with CGV, students can easily pull up their academic status right away with a single click. They can monitor what classes are talking with the bracket indicating their Gen-Ed categories, how many more credits are left with which Gen-Ed to take, and manage each course&rsquo;s grade evaluations indicated via bars like Angel.

                    After that it shows the cumulative GPA, we can also type and plan courses that user would take.(There is a link to Academic plan). And putting in targeting GPA and it shows cumulative GPA.
