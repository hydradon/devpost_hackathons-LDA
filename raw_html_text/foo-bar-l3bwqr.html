                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Illness and medical treatment is very hard for all stakeholders.
Imagine a child enjoying his time at the hospital and how that would help the parents and the staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aha! helps with the communication between the parents, children and the the hospital staff, by providing a novel interactive picture based interface, which works as a daily schedule for the patient and staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The family can see upcoming events, understand the overall treatment process clearly and communicate it to the small patient, with the help of the pictures. The child becomes familiar with the procedures, facilities and personnel, which reduces his stress and anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A "sticker" feature was implemented for the child to play with and gamification is planned as a future development where the stickers can be achieved as awards when advancing in the treatment adventure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded on an existing open source image-interface library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had extensive discussion on the scope of the project: what should be the actual problem to solve and what are we capable of solving in this short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome our differences in perspective and combine our completely different viewpoints into a concrete and very feasible solution that we are able to build and demonstrate during the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot from different people working in healthcare and got a good view of their different perspectives in to the challenge and how to use this valuable domain insight to address the needs of each party.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AHA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with Opera and other hospital information systems. Administration interface for hospital staff. Credential management for users. Extensive user testing to evaluate the feasibility of the features and what else could be beneficial to users.
