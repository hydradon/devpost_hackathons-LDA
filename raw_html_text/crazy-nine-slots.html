                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the need to bring more engaging Kin spends to the ecosystem.  We asked around about what Kin community members would like to see built and from that feedback we became inspired to meet the Devpost challenge deadline with our simulated gambling product and further feel inspired to push the boundaries of cash for the digital world...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crazy Nine Slots is a Modern Slot Machine game with a fun little twist and new engaging blockchain interaction and group challenges made possible by the Kin Ecosystem.
                    <br>
                    Players can challenge 7 different game styles to achieve the highest possible in-game score.  They can earn 3 different jackpots and one bonus wheel spin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Crazy Nine Slots" was built with a lot of love, hard work and dedication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Kin almost a year ago and had a few challenges and I think most projects stumbled a few times early on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We overcame some of these challenges by reaching out to the open source/ Kin community for assistance.  Will from Catpurse/Tipster/Python Bootstrap etc remains one of our most honorable mentions for assisting with some of the tools we needed in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to have an exiting app built in time for the challenge.  Making Crazy Nine Slots was a journey that challenged me to think outside the box and come up with solutions and innovations to meet the Kin Crypto Challenge deadline and requirements.  Other than that, just making a really amazing game that the community has been asking for awhile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use our UI/UX in new ways to engage users and create an entire new strategy around Kin that I found myself wanting to explore more than the in-game coins.  Using Kin is something I will continue to develop in the mobile app space because of the new level of engagement possible with users and there aren't many Slot apps out there with the potential for these kind of rewards and community driven challenges or micro transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crazy Nine Slots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LEADERBOARDS:
We are currently working on leaderboards and want to use our app to experiment with a new monetization strategy that rewards users for their engagement. Not just a little but with all of the in-app purchasing or Ad revenue and work on building Kin as a reward token and our user base for the first 6-12 months.  This is a big part of our future and what's next for Crazy Nine Slots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GAMEPLAY:
See our poker slots and Playfab update in the updates section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also we will have animated graphics and more illustrations to go along with and develop our theme and Kin and think it will be an important quality feature we put a high priority on.  We have the code for this and will just need to design the sprites to be animated.
