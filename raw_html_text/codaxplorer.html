                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CODA challenge was to synchronize a node with the live CODA testnet and create a cool visualization using the CODA GraphQL API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application runs a query to the API to get information about the nodes on the network. It then pains the nodes on a geographic map based on their coordinate location, and colors the node based off it's trust level. Other information such as the IP address is accessible by clicking on a node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python, we built a script to access the API and generate an HTML page with interactive node information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Main libraries used were
                    <code>
                        requests
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        folium
                    </code>
                    , and
                    <code>
                        ip2geotools
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MacOS build was broken, so had to work with CODA team to set up alternative. Also was expecting more data to be returned from query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with a new API and visual display library.
