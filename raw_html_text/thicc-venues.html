                    The social economy of events is organized by dialogue between Venues and Performers/Organizers and driven by a background population of Normal event-seeking Individuals
                </p>
                <p>
                    We propose a web platform which facilitates Venue/Organizer communication while aggregating event information to be promoted to the general population.

                    Facebook already does robust event aggregation and recommendation, but it lacks a simple filter and map-oriented aggregated presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We attempt to implement the first stage of this by aggregating local event information in a react/redux framework.
