                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration (vision) is to save trees by reducing the amount of printing receipt in shops/stores, with the use of send-anywhere API, I would like to build the concept of &ldquo;no-receipt anywhere&rdquo;, by introducing to you this &ldquo;eReceipt anywhere&rdquo;, with aiming capabilities of &ldquo;fast, secure, and cost-effective&rdquo;. Term Fast: nowadays, mobile-phone is anywhere with human, this serve the convenient for humans to store the receipt in mobile-phone and reduce the probability of losing the receipt after they stored it. Term Secure: with the beneficial from Send-Anywhere API feature, through the optimal relay path which is a P2P approach that send data or files in real-time, meaning that every digital transfer to the recipient is in time-based configuration, a given of &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; to allow for authorized receiving restrict the knowledge of hackers know when the time of the files are uploaded. With further enforcing the security, the 6-digit key approach is used in order for recipient to receive the file. Term Cost-Effective: for operating businesses can use this method for their shops/stores to deliver the receipt in electronics form and thus lead to greater saving in operation cost and most importantly, save trees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Send-Anywhere is absolutely a brilliant idea, why? Because of its direct pipes to another device safely (on 1-to-1 basis and time-limiting download), this is ideal for confidential transaction with people especially strangers like every customer who shop in a retail store. So, for my idea of this API is to use it for receipt transfer for every purchase a customer made.

                    Thermal paper are coated with a layer of phenols called Bispherol A (BPA). BPA has been proven to cause reproductive defects in fetuses, infants, children, and adults as well as cancer, metabolic, and immune problems in rodents. BPA levels from receipts much higher than exposures from food packaging or plastic.
