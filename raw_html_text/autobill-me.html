                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having issues having to chase up smaller payments for services like hosting as it was time consuming for our accounts dept. Wanted to automate the collection process for these invoices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It syncs overdue invoices from Xero and then contacts the user asking them to add their credit card details. We store these as Stripe/Eway tokens and then use to charge the customer automatically from that point forward when and invoice is due. When the customer is charged the payment is automatically applied to their invoice and is sent to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP and integrated with Xero and payment gateways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the processing side of it was challenging as had to ensure it didn't double charge people etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulling the whole thing together finally - as this was a non paying project we were always being delayed by other projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the Xero API and payment gateways.
                </p>
