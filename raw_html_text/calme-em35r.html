                    Background/ Problem (WHY)
According to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), about 40 million American adults have some type of anxiety disorder every year. People with social and emotional disabilities like autism, asperger syndrome and some other panic disorders suffer even more with anxiety related problems which affect their daily lives and communication with others.

                    Solution (WHAT)
Calme (AKA:Calm me) is a combination of hardware and software/ app solution. It will inform the person who wear or touch the device and his or her partners, ex. doctor, counselor, family, teacher his or her stress/ anxiety level in numbers and colors. Calme allows people with disability and others around them to be aware of the raising stress level &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; and intervene and help relieve before the anxiety attack. In the long-run, by collecting and analyzing biofeedbacks, Calme can build behavior patterns, provide recommendations and help people manage their emotions more effectively.
