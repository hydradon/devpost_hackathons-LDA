                    The consumers are key actors in the Smart City. The Citizens will increasingly start to act as energy prosumers (energy users that also produce energy in their buildings) that both consume and produce energy by themselves. From that concept we thought of making a software to keep the alignment as much as we can so consumers have the opportunity to decide, how much they are willing to pay as a specific charge for using energy for different equipment.
