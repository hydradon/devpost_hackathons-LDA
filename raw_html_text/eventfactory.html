                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came out about from the sheer necessity of a convenient planning tool which would be effective for keeping people up to date at events such as YCP Hacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Event Factory is a web app that generates APK files based on certain criteria set by the user in the web environment. This APK file will allow you to install an Android app that allows you to see the events planned by the Organizer and receive notifications based off of the Start and End dates/times previously configured.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Jetty WebServer to host our web application, using JSPs and servlets. We also used Android Studio to develop the android front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript syntax proved to be quite finicky and caused snags throughout development, however we quickly analyzed the problems presented and resolved the numerous issues JavaScript caused. Also, during development using Android Studio we had problems trying to locate files on the Android File system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to achieve an aesthetically and programmatically pleasing product which serves a positive purpose for the community, and in a very short amount of time despite having a short amount of time to develop an idea for the project and communicate ideas before development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More in-depth understanding of how JavaScript, JSPs, and Java Servlets function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventFactory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More in depth app functionality, reconfigurable events and occasions, administrator privileges,  tablet support, more varied areas of event attributes from the main organizer.'
