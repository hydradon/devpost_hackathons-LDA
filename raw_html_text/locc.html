                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the abduction of college students and small children, to preventable assaults that occur in close proximity to friend groups, this application aims to help friends keep track of each other more successfully, leading to a safer world for everyone and helping to shield many people from preventable disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to create groups of people to help mutually keep track of each other. If someone leaves the designated area (either geographic location or circle around an individual) all members receive a notification and the option to contact the group member.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked collaboratively over the course of the Hackathon to create an Android Application that performs the basic functionality of the app idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of time! We were also relatively inexperienced with Android programming which contributed to a slow start on the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came together to each individually contribute important pieces to the development of the app. We also learned much more than we had expected to and feel that we accomplished much more than we expected in terms of the completion of the application.
                </p>
