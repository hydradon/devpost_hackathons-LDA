                </h2>
                <p>
                    One online, biometrically-secured ID that can be used anywhere.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CitiD is an ID that allows users to securely verify their digital identities for use in online and real-world contexts. Citi verifies the user-submitted government-issued ID (like a passport or drivers license), connecting thier physical ID to thier CitiD. This digital ID, which verifies personal information such as birth date and address, can be connected to other online applications that license CitiD in a process similar to the "Log in with Facebook" feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CitiD has a number of applications for users and businesses. Bars can use CitiD to securely verify a user is over 21 years old. If a user connects a credit card to their CitiD, they can validate online and brick-and-mortar purchases to licensed vendors using biometrics. Just scan a QR code on the vendor's device, and approve and validate the purchase using a thumbprint or FaceID. Finally, social media platforms can use CitiD to verify thier users' identity. This can not only prevent underage use of age-restricted platforms, but also prevent "catfishing" and other digital impersonation. A "CitiD-verified" insignia on a user's social media profile ensures that an account represents an actual person.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge for this prompt was comparing and contrasting cryptographic algorithms to ensure that users' sensitive identifying information will be secure from bad actors. Another difficult challenge was figuring out how Citi could license it to businesses as a product.

                    What's next for CitiD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for CitiD fleshing out the back-end and building it up as a lightweight, scalable service that can be marketed to businesses and individuals.
