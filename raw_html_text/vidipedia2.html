                    I and my team were thinking of making Wikipedia for videos on the internet. We considered Vidipedia to be the platform that would allow VIDEO VIEWERS to have access to CHANGE or EDIT what they were watching. The idea sounds interesting, as people could add values to educational content uploaded by others and also become more creative and give an alternate ending to a tv series last episode. We realized that the possibilities were endless, so we jumped on it. We divided the tasks appropriately in our team and learned a lot of new things about video player web apps through the developing process. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the whole idea because of time restrictions, but we tried our level best to learn online the skills required to develop an online video editor. However, I, Zaid Jaria would never forget how wonderful these 2 days were working with such a wonderful team, and working on something that might give the people on the internet full access to the social media uploaded. #vidipedia.
