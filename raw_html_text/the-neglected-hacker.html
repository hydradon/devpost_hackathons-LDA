                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of the Local Day Hackathon by Major League Hacking and Github, We wanted to create a website that has resources that are not easy to find. This is how we came up with the name, the 'Neglected Hacker' because for most mainstream fields, there are plenty of resources online but for those less popular such as Micro-controllers and Simulators, there are not that many. So we wanted to create a website that caters to that particular group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has information to the four categories that we decided to tackle first, Micro-controllers, Micro-processors, Simulators, Introduction to Programming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using  HTML , CSS and Bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had internet challenges but we managed to work together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting new people who didnt know HTML and CSS to start using it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of fields where information is hard to find but we can create something that can help people find communities who know that information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Neglected Hacker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the site and make it be able to help people find communities in their area. Our repository is open source for anyone to contribute to
