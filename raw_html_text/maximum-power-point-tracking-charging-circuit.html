                    For the past few years, the growth of wireless sensors in the maintenance industry has increased exponentially. In many situations where a battery source is needed, it&rsquo;s not always simple to reach and change, there is a time consuming step process to take and might be repeated if there are branches or any other systems relying on a battery source. Due to the time consumption, costly upkeep, and work needed to continuously place these batteries, a system is desperately needed to eliminate the need for battery replacement, or lengthen the life of the battery itself.  With this in mind, we have designed a system to improve efficiency and lengthen the lifespan of a desired battery, and possibly eliminate the need for battery replacement. We achieved this goal by constructing a charging circuit to store and harness the maximum energy harvested from an alternative vibration power generator. For testing purposes and due to lack of resources right now, we used Arduino and a Bluetooth module to communicate wirelessly with an Android device to obtain feedback related to the battery status, in this case, the program is able to tell if the battery is within a range of 4 different charging percentages: 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% and 75-100%.
