                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Tendermint team has been one of my main sources of inspiration in the blockchain community since its founding days. I've built mobile plugins and websocket based interactions on early versions of Tendermint. The Mirian team has been building a Social Wallet iOS app that focuses on a great user experience but our Social Wallet dapp runs on Ethereum and can be slow or expensive to trade with at times; so workarounds are required to provide a good UX. We've revamped the trading backbone of our app as a DEX using Cosmos-sdk, and now our infrastructure reliably delivers cheap transactions at scale with finality to our frontend so we can deliver the type of UX our users are looking for!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MirianCosmosDex is an IOS app built with React Native that directly integrates with CosmosDex deployed on our AWS EC2. It's running on the Cosmos testnet. We used Cosmos-SDK and other listed libraries and components as our stack to build it, we're serving it at

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cosmos-sdk unfortunately still isn't mature and we experienced some of its growing pains. There were some bugs we created fixes for on github and submitted pull requests. We later saw on the hackathon slack that others had similar issues and a mod saw our pull request and merged it, so our fix went through!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we've integrated with a non-Ethereum blockchain, so we're very happy to celebrate this milestone. We've learned a lot, built something that users can use to quickly trade together, but more importantly demonstrated that our users will be able to tap into Cosmos internet of blockchains to use future DeFi products to come. As we explore future use cases of our technology and integrations with other DeFi products, having the experience to easily spin up Cosmos-sdk will prove very valuable to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned some skills using cosmos-sdk and go, but more importantly learned we shouldn't sacrifice UX for poor blockchain performance. Cosmos/tendermint's performance once we got it to work is clearly superior and works very well. This opened our eyes on what can be possible to build with it in the future. We also learned that although it's awesome a lot of this is still early stage technology that will take time and effort from our community to mature fully, but it's great to see it grow more and more!

                    What's next for Mirian Cosmos Gateway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're launching the Mirian iOS app this month to the appstore so it's a very exciting time for us! We'd also like to further develop what we've built into something stable and evaluate how we could bring liquidity to our DEX using IBC. Once we finish that it's a matter of time before our entire dapp runs on Cosmos live!
