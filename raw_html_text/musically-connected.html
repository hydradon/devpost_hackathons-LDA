                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be frustrating and difficult to try to find others to jam with or try to start a band with. We wanted to make this process more convenient and accessible for musicians who are looking for others to play music with or talk. We aim to build up the connections in the Los Angeles music community by building this platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a platform where musicians can create an account and begin looking for other musicians instantly! A musician can dictate what his preferences are or which type of musician they are looking for, from categories such as singer, guitar player, bass, and many more. We then give them the results of their search for people with traits they are looking for, in a visually appealing profile layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever a user is registered we create a collections instance for them and update the data in Firebase, and similarly, when a user logs in we check to see if their email and password correspond with a data set in Firebase using authentication flows. We then built a platform using mainly JavaScript with React to create a single page application that dynamically renders content based on events that occur, such as button clicks, and render content corresponding to which button was clicked on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team working with new technologies, we ran into many frequent hurdles and frustrations. We had to debug the requests to connect with Firebase and our authentication keys extensively, and were able to successfully configure the database after many failed compiles with the help of the Firebase documentation.
We also ran into many troubles on the front-end side with layering out a page and dynamically rendering content, and while it is still a frustrating endeavor, we were able to layout many pages well and create pages that flowed intuitively from one to the other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to connect the front-end with the back-end and being able to store users in a database so that people can create an account and then login successfully. But, most especially, we are proud that we were able to collaborate and get through hurdles and deliver a minimum viable working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all hackers who decided to come in learning something new and each of us worked with technologies that we have not used before. We learned about React for front-end development which drove the user experience and user interface. We learned about Firebase and how to set it up, use it, and authenticate users successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Musically Connected
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believed that by connecting musicians with each other in the Los Angeles area, we could make the musical community more involved and inclusive. For those who have struggled to meet others of similar interests or music tastes, or for those who want to play music with others, we connect music-lovers with each other. We hope to expand this website to be more inclusive and diverse and to have a section where we connect people with others with the same music taste.
