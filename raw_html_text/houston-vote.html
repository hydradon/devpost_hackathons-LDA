                    Only 13 percent of Houston voted in the last local election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a civic responsibility to change that number and ensure we (all of us) are electing the leaders of our city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this three-part project, we aim to ignite a movement and create an urgency around voting in Houston.

                    The hub for this conversation will be the website you see today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site will give individuals and organizations the opportunity to stand up for the importance of voting, make a commitment not only to voting, but also to acting as a voice for voting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this online hub, we'll have additional means to drive the conversation, share tools and ideas through a Facebook group and Twitter feed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will carry these efforts offline through a series of VOTE murals (similar to the #GIVEHOU murals you may have seen) and community forums/events with candidate participation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our intention is to dramatically change the way people participate in the voting process.
