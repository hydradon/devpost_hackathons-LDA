                    I enjoy playing darts and wanted Alexa to do the grunt work of keeping score.

                <p>
                    Throw Darts will keep track of the score, who's turn it is and even recommend a throw if you're playing double out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built the skill using Amazon's new APL language and Python
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't developed anything very difficult before so I had to learn about DynamoDB, APL and a little more of how the intents and slots need to be fine tuned to get the best possible experience with the skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot on this project so I feel comfortable developing more skills for the echo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future I might other dart games such as Cricket, Killer, Golf, etc.
