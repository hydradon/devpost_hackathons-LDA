                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In CS we learned about sorting algorithms but the way that it was explained to use made it unclear. We decided to try and remedy this by creating an app to teach different sorting algorithms.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It demonstrates sorting algorithms.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed the idea beforehand and used Eclipse and the Java Swing library.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members had a lot of difficulty with the WiFi, so we did most of it offline. We had many ideas we wanted to do, but we knew that we had to stick to goals that were achievable within 24 hours. We are also Foundations Computer Science (a beginner CS course) students, so we only knew basic Java.

                <p>
                    We got it done in time, which is pretty impressive. We also learned many new things.
