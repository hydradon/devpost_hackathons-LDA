                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social platforms are meant to do just that, allow us to be social. Certain platforms make an effort to call attention to special bonds between two users, but usually don&rsquo;t end up effectively accomplishing their goal. We wanted to come up with a solution to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you and another sign up to use our platform together, you will both be reminded via email or text to contact each other weekly. Our random prompt generator will help keep the conversation going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a straightforward approach to the engineering solutions in this project. All logic was implemented using Python within a Flask framework and then deployed onto a web server using the Heroku platform. Additionally, there are miscellaneous API calls for items such as sending texts and retrieving images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deployment to a web server was a much larger challenge than we expected it to be; routing email addresses through the cloud platform has a large amount of dependencies, many of which have not been updated in several years. We didn't have enough manpower on this project which is why many of our peripheral services are incomplete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud to present our final CloseAway platform to your today. Our two greatest accomplishments are our branding and engineering solutions. This project was out of the scope of our skills and we learned a lot throughout the development process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask as a framework, and specifically how Python interacts with HTML/CSS. We also learned a lot about SMTP and how to set up web servers using an external platform like Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CloseAway
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, CloseAway is available exclusively for pairs of users. We plan to make our platform available for groups of three or more users. Additionally, we'd like to implement a larger database with more engaging prompts.
