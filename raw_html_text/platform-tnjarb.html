                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome's Dino game and Super Mario Bros.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a platformer where the player acts as a marshmallow trying to dodge the flames.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded a custom view class.  The entire project was built with only standard Java and Android SDK libraries, no external libraries were used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to add layers of animation while keeping the UI from locking up; I needed workarounds since Android imposes limitations on which threads can modify its Views.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    (Semi-) Successfullying creating my first multi-screen/activity app after watching tutorials online.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That vectors are super convenient, and much less annoying than arrays.  Also that I don't know collections syntax...
