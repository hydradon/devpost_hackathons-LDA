                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was inspired by the fun demo provided by ActivBody. We wanted to create our own version of a game based off of the type of phone games we enjoy playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Star Runner is an android app that first connects to a nearby Activ5 device, and guides the user to calibrate their maximum strength for the game. Users are then required to manipulate their strength in order for the character to dodge the oncoming stars.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire app was built on Android Studio. For this project, we used fragments, recycled views, and surface view in order to accomplish the smooth transitions and gameplay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire group had little to no experience using Android Studio, so we spent a good amount of time learning the basics and getting used to the software. Additionally, our group had planned on doing another project, but had to pivot late through the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had very little experience, and the fact that we were able to both implement the SDK and complete the android application was a huge accomplishment for us all. We are also extremely proud that we were able to finish because we had to pivot so late in the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire group learned a huge amount about android studio and fragments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Star Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create this game on the app store, but with more advanced graphics.
