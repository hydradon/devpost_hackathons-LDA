                    The group divided in to two teams to work on the user interface and water sensor monitoring interface.
User interface
Model wireframe having 3 interfaces for different users, 1. Beneficiaries 2. Management 3. Contractors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        1. Beneficiaries interface:
                    </strong>
                    Reporting user difficulties or dysfunctions, in addition to accountability measures such as
complaints, lack of access, and/or reporting lack of access to fresh water in remote areas in the
informal settlement of DZK, assisting NRC for further project expansion and identification, in
addition to provision of a guide map for the nearest available water point to the household
based on the location reports (Here&rsquo;s assistance!)
*voice message functionality for the illiterate, Language considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2. Management interface (NRC or authorities)
                    </strong>
                    Login access based on the required user rights for the relevant staff. Data visualization of stats
from water monitoring sensor system as well as user complaints, enabling staff to share with
other stakeholders and authorities.
ID numbers for water purifier units based on the location (Here!) presenting data on the quality,
quantity and status based on the reports from the beneficiaries. Creating a case of follow up for
the unit, and follow up status.
Referral to the contractor for further technical follow up.
                    <em>
                        sending push notifications for updates on the follow up of repairs and access updates.
**3. Contractor interface
                    </em>
                    *
Notifications on the faulty unit, follow up status, and report to NRC.
Water sensor monitoring interface
After researching the available and required sensors below information was gathered:
PH sensor: measuring quality, range from 0-70 with the market value of 25 Euros.
Flow sensors: measuring the speed of water from 0-30 liters per minute with the market value of 10
Euros.
TDS sensors: ranging from 0-1000 with the market value of 25 Euros.
Chlorine solutions to be considered after the calculations based on the gathered data.
We will use a micro controller to receive central data via different communication protocols. On the one
hand a GSM/GRSM connection is made to a remote web server, on the other hand existing water tanks
are remotely equipped via open amateur frequency band telemetry system.
The web server will create an interface for a mobile app, and pushes information to the local micro
controller for notifications and updates.
