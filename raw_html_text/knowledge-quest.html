                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the trivia games we played growing up.  Our fond memories of playing those different games translated to creating something for kids to learn about the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge Quest provides facts about different "adventures," or topics that kids can learn about.  They are then quizzed on the information they just heard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With previous skill development experience, we used Node.js and Visual Studio Code to create knowledge quest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the data to be read by the game so that it could produce engaging adventures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together to create a new game that is educational for both kids and adults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose topics that we were interested in and tried to find some kid friendly, interesting information to fill the adventures with.  Even though we were already had a base understanding of the topics, we still learned some new information!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Knowledge Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add sounds and images so that it could be more engaging.
