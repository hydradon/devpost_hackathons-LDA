                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chemistry, Mathematics, QUANTUM physics, Biology... the list goes on, recursing into countless topics more... We've got less than an ARM's length of time to our exams, yet we're flooded by the need to keep thinking about what to focus on, and how we would absorb the knowledge into our heads -- how do we push the FRONTIER of our knowledge and what should we study first?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But yet, why do we have to be the ones wasting our jet brains on making these decisions?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the tediousness of planning and prioritising what to study, when to study and how study is unnecessary and often messy. We should be spending our time on the things that matter - learning with greater depth or spending quality time with our friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improvable is a platform which takes care of this for you - it learns about you as you learn about the world. It provides you with practice questions for your exams and knows what you are good at and bad at, adapting to your abilities and reinforcing the concepts you have freshly learnt through personalised notifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what good is that in a boring interface? Improvable is more than a platform - it's a lively and lovely chat bot and personalised learning buddy. It tells jokes, keeps track of your learning and accelerates your learning just for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within each session, users will be available to review their performances by sharing, rating and comparing their statistics against the past, or their friends. Scoring is based on each session and provides a dynamic, interactive and accurate metric for fast and motivating feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distilling the ethos of every inspiring teacher-pupil relationship was at the heart of Improvable. From then, we've tessellated, out, creating complex ORIGAMI folds, adding humour and personality to solid facts whilst keeping the interface fresh, crisp and as sharp as an ARGON bulb. Each of the four stages has been carefully crafted before being PUSHed to fulfil the gestalt of what learning can be. Using a powerful MICROSOFT azure server, Improvable was designed to be fast and responsive, giving the student full responsibility and MANpower over the STUDIO of study.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We changed our ideas midway after realising that creating a learning buddy would be much more interactive and intuitive than our initial straight-laced platform, and had to quickly adjust our mindset and code. What better way would there be than for the student to forge their own path of discovery of learning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow the writer free reign over the product, with natural language of their own - this proved to be a challenge that needed pure PUSHERS to overcome in pure javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our learning buddy has spread joy and knowledge to the people around us. We've relished the opportunity to imbue each of our own contrasting personalities into Improvable, ensuring that there's something for everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first bot built for most of us, and definitely lots more about DirectLine and the Microsoft Azure APIs for bots and AI. Was an accelerated 24 hours of learning for all of us! Seeing, interacting and constantly developing the bot was a rewarding experience for all, and hopefully the first of many similar ones to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for improvable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it out to students, teachers and users everywhere! 
We understand that not every student can afford to have personalised feedback from teachers and private tutors all the time - why not make such a service accessible to all students just through a click of a button?
