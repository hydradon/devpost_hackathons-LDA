                    PROBLEM STATEMENT:Closed loop irrigation solution for farmers:
Irrigating fields plays a vital role in crop yield. However, how much and when to irrigate is still moderated by the traditional knowledge for the farmers. Knowing how much water is actually required for a given crop for a particular soil type depends majorly on soil&rsquo;s capacity to hold moisture. We need an IoT, AI based solution which can auto irrigate the fields for a given crop based on the soil moisture content.

                    This document covers the following sections
1.Know the moisture content in the soil using sensors:
2.Predict the weather condition: 
3.Based on the soil moisture present, determine the quantity of water to be released for irrigation: 
4.Stop the motor when required soil moisture content has been achieved: 
5.Automatic start and stop of the motor for irrigating water in the field:

                    Following is a list of minimum hardware to realise a deployable working prototype of the system.
Wi-Fi Router
Node MCUs
Soil moisture sensors
Waterproof boxes
Alarms
arduino
Connecting wires for internal components

                <p>
                    Soil sensors connected to Node MCUs are deployed throughout the field in a closed loop. Each node is encased in a waterproof box with an alarm system.
The nodes are connected to a central router through Wi-Fi, enabling the system to communicate wirelessly.
Data from the sensors is sent to the router which is passed on to the Ardino for analysis.
Using Machine Learning, real-time analysis of the weather and soil is done.
Depending on the size of the field, an appropriate time is calculated and the motor is switched ON for the required amount of time.
The motor remains OFF if the system predicts a fair chance of rain. If it doesn't rain for a considerable amount of time, the motor is switched ON to supply the water required.
This process repeats at regular intervals till the crop is ready to be harvested.

                <p>
                    Since all the nodes communicate separately to the central device, drip/sprinkler can be switched ON only for the particular area requiring water, further conserving water and improving the accuracy of the system. This feature additonally requires a servomotor
