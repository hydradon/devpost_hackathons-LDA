                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to figure out what in our daily lives still bothered us the most, one of us pulled out a copy of our Syllabus to find out when the next test was. Fascinated by the fact that we still have to sort through and manually add these classes and important dates to our calendar manually every semester, we decided to automate it and have seamless integration with your existing google calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After signing into your Google account to authorize the creation of calendar events, our web app will allow you to import any Syllabus in the form of a PDF and it'll read through the entire PDF looking for class dates, test/quizzes, and assignment due dates. Then It'll export the events to your Google Calendar and display a page with your embedded calendar, a link to buy your textbook for cheap (if listed in the syllabus) and some recommended videos to watch to help you in the course.
