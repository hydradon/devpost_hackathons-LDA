                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were very excited to see local nonprofits participating in the hackathon by pitching ideas to teams, we personally did not feel inspired to pick up any of the ideas pitched to us.  But that doesn't mean they are bad ideas!  In fact, many of them were great.  They just didn't strike our fancy in the moment.  But what about the future?  And what about other hackers?  Not just hackers in Santa Barbara, but hackers all over the world.  What if we could connect nonprofits in need of developers and designers to designers and developers looking to strengthen their portfolio?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    develop.me provides nonprofits in need of web techs with an easy way of reaching out to the massive online web tech community.  On the flip side, it allows web techies to search through projects ideas and build their portfolio whilst simultaneously lending a helping hand towards awesome organizations that are making positive change in their local and global communities.
