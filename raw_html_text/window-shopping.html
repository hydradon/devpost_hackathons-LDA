                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from looking at the data sets and reading about machine learning.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes as input a sequence of DOTA2 item IDs representing the past purchases of the player and produces the ID of the expected next purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start use the command "java -jar WindowShopping.jar" in your shell, it will then load the training data from the folder the jar file is in which should contain "players.csv" and "purchase_log.csv". After the training is done it will write the first expected purchase (an integer item id) to the standard output. You can then use the commands '+' ex. +65 to add an item to the sequence of purchases, '-reset' to clear the sequence, and '-exit' to exit the program. After each change to the sequence the next expected purchase will be written to the standard output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also use the code as a library if you want.

                    It's written in Java and uses a library called SPMF (

                <p>
                    I tried some of the other sequence prediction algorithms in the library and some more not sequence algorithms from a project called Weka but this one worked best.

                    Finding a good machine learning algorithm, most of the ones I tried were not great at predicting the next purchase.

                <p>
                    Finishing the project. Also I think it's pretty accurate for only using the past purchases as input.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was planning on trying to produce two guesses for the next item instead of just one since I think that would improve the chance of the correct one being shown to the player. I also wanted to use more of the game state as input to the prediction model (for example the player's current gold) if I had time.
