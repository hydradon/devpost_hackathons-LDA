                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConcertHero is based off of the fact that finding concerts is actually a lot of work! Unless you check for concerts all of the time, you've probably heard of concerts that you might really like to go to after the fact and/or too late to buy tickets. Kurt and I, the creators of ConcertHero, know that struggle. We created this web app to make an easy, automated, user friendly way to find concerts for you - the user!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConcertHero uses your Spotify profile to find concerts in your area of all the bands you already like. It also recommends bands &amp; concerts to you that are similar to bands that you already enjoy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kurt and I built ConcertHero with Python and Django to display the data we found in a user-friendly way on the web. We are running a local Django server to simulate it because we did not have enough time to deploy ConcertHero in production on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are using Spotify's public API, which is incredibly easy to use and very large, with any methods &amp; functions that we might possibly need. We are also using StubHub's public API, which is slightly more difficult to use, but also had wide customization of the methods within for us to perform our concert searches easily!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making several HTTP requests from the local Django server was tough, as neither of us had ever used Django before. It was also our first project in Python in several years, and as we made the project we relearned the language! The other challenges we ran into was in working with the APIs and debugging errors with our API function use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConcertHero is a fully customized and functioning web app that allows the user to log in and immediately see a unique selection of concerts personally recommended to them in their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Django, using online APIs, and how to create a project from scratch in a short period of time. This was our first (real) hackathon!
We also learned that trying to build a project over an incredibly busy weekend, with both of us having conflicting schedules, requires a lot of sleep sacrifices!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ConcertHero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConcertHero is great, but has many improvements that can be made to become even better! 
Immediate Future: Improvements:
Make more user friendly! (always a goal)
Upload to web for online users to use (right now only usable on our personal computers)
Less hardcoded code! 
Allow user to pick location around where they want to find concerts in &amp; around
Allow user to specify ticket prices, how far they're willing to travel, etc.!
Allow user to rate concert selection
Allow user to add artists of people they'd like to see to the search result (similar to what bandsInTown does, but this isn't a main feature, just for convenience's sake!)
Add in more concerts for user based off of songs they've liked.
Several other features we're forgetting about right now!
Future Future - Ideas:
Machine Learning Applications (we are both CS students with a fondness for anything AI-related) - 1) create own related artists using the user's related artists and their feedback on concert selection. 2) based on feedback, make more pertinent concert selections (user rates some concerts 1 star, some 5 star, recommend more of the  5-star-esque concerts and less of the 1 star!
Non ML Applications: 1) Share concerts you find with your existing friends on spotify. 2) Have a friend feature on the app where you can add other users as friends and recommend/discuss concerts.
