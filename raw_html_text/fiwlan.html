                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a product that lets users easily find free internet, where a connection is guaranteed to have at one point existed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays the user a map with the 10 closest free internet hotspots to their person, which they can click on to obtain the name, and view a picture of the exact spot where the connection occurred so the that user knows where they can go to get connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend/server stores our database of free wifi hotspots, which can be tapped into using the frontend javascript browser imbedded in a mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HERE API's were not in great shape (the Swift api, which we were initially planning on using, didn't work at all) and the javascript provided its fair share of gimmicks. Additionally, passing data between so many different languages and frameworks was challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an app that does what we set out to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more about API's, teamwork, Hackathon tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fiwlan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will make the wifi selection more selective such that only verifiably functional and free hotspots ended up getting POSTed, rather than potential scams.
