                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People make bad choices when it comes to food. It would be great if there was a way to help create positive reinforcement for choosing better foods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill simulates a game show where two food items are thrown over a wall. The goal of the player is to try and the better food item to catch. The better the food item, the higher the score. Fruits and water rank highest while candy and sugary drinks rank lowest. After a player scores 500 points, they are awarded a larger food catalog to have thrown over the wall. This can make choosing which side to catch more difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in Python using an AWS Lambda function. The persistence is from Dynamodb. It uses one table for User data and another for Conversation data.
                </p>

                    Logo, I wanted a cooler logo with a flying chicken.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son and daughter thought it was fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Candies and cakes are really bad, I need more reinforcement learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Catchers Game Show
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more levels to include calorie guesser and pick that vegetable. These rounds would make the game richer and thereby making it more fun for users.
