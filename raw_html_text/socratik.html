                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the rigidity and inefficiency of socratic seminars and English class activities in general at our respective high schools, and felt the necessity to make a web app that streamlined the education process for students and teachers. To accomplish this, we designed our plans for Socratik, our group education organization enhancement interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socratik connects students to their classmates and teachers in a comprehensive platform, allowing them to ask questions about their classes and mutually enhance their learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our own custom REST API that communicated with MongoLab, we were able to implement sockets for our response and message board with highly customized developer structure. Art such as icons and backgrounds were compiled using GIMP, and were implemented and programmed via tedious HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very challenged in learning how to get around the dependencies of our custom API and how forward progress towards that goal was obstructed by messy Git concurrencies. In addition, we also had trouble figuring out where and when to fit in our sleep schedule so as not to let our efficiency be impaired by sleep deprivation (such as that which I, David, am currently suffering from!). Overall, however, by the time the deadline rolled around, we overcame and crunched down to complete what needed to get done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our ability to create a fully customized API that was specialized for our interface as well as our sleek &amp; modern aesthetic design. Of course, none of these items are perfect, but simply leave room for further improvement and development. Still, we are happy with the results considering the time constraint of &lt;24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about time management and working with Git. These were some of our biggest challenges and proved difficult to incorporate into our improvised workflow. However, we grew as a team and as programmers to collaborate and plan accordingly to accomodate our plans as group efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Socratik
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have a long way to go, such as more visual optimization and admin privilege implementation (for teachers) among other external and internal implementations that would further integrate more learning utilities for classroom use. We even planned a highly specialized socratic seminar mode for English or History classes, perhaps even assignment organizing databases.
