                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program began with the idea of mental health information, as it seems to be lacking in mobile app stores. Since we could not create a good enough concept for that idea, we expanded to both mental and physical health and eventually came up with the idea of a medicine tracker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides simple help for exercises and information concerning physical and mental health and allows for the scheduling and tracking of medicine intake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the basic structure of the

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accidentally wrote half the code in Java instead of JavaScript.
We ended up restarting the project in terms of our goal about three times.
We were seriously overestimating our ability to write good-looking web pages.
We did not plan ahead on the structure of the website and program enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logo turned out very well in our opinion.
We really liked the color-changing background on the index page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always plan out and pseudocode before starting the project.
Do not push everything to master in Github.
The organization and coordination of a project is very possibly the hardest part of programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sage - Physical and Mental Health Help
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make the medicine tracker be able to store the schedules as well as edit or delete them upon user command. We also want to rewrite this as a real mobile application that can utilize push notifications for the medicine reminders.
