                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a pilot had always fascinated me and when I saw the opportunity to merge flight with my love for technology, I jumped on the opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fli let's anyone feel like they are a pilot by giving them a First Person View(FPV) from the drone through the Oculus Rift, and letting them control the drone with your hands using the Myo. Our goal is to make the controlling as natural as possible.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had this idea and managed to form a team of three to build it. It turned out that my teammate who was an Oculus expert didn't even make it to Canada and my other teammate had to leave six hours in. This meant I had to learn ver quickly and do the whole project by myself.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to use three pieces of hardware that I had never used before to build this application.
