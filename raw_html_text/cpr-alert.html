                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In areas where there is a high demand for EMS services, or in areas where it takes a long time for EMS services to reach a patient, time is of the essence when there is a cardiac arrest emergency. Each year 475 000 Canadians die from cardiac arrest, with more than 350 000 occurring outside the hospital. 18.8% of these are at public settings, 69.5% at homes/residences, and 11.7% at nursing homes. However, only 46% of those experiencing Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) get the immediate help they need, leaving over half of those experiencing OHCA a lower chance of survival.

                <p>
                    This app allows members of the public to create a notification to others who have the app. Those who are within a nearby vicinity are notified of the emergency. If there are any people who are certified in first aid (ie. first responders, off-duty nurses, doctors, paramedics, etc.) they can be alerted of the emergency and attend quicker than EMS may arrive. Non-medical staff can increase chances of OHCA victim&rsquo;s survival by performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) - 45% of OHCA victims survived when bystander CPR was administered.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using android studio and Java. The interface was created using XML. Google maps API was integrated to show the locations of emergencies.

                    Showing the locations of the emergencies - we were unable to find a way to gather this information and show it on the app.
