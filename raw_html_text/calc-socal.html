                    In many countries, vendors include the sales tax of an item as part of the listed price. As a result, people in many countries do not have to worry about paying more than what the listed price states. This is not the case in America, however, and presents a problem when tourists come to America, especially to Southern California, are unaware of the fact that America does not include sales tax in listed prices.

                    There are many sales tax calculators out there, but none of them take into account the various sales tax laws regarding the different tax laws every single area in LA county. For example, if you drive from Los Angeles all the way to Santa Monica to visit the beach for the day, the sales tax rate can jump from 9.5% to 10%.  While this might not be a significant difference, it will be for tourists who come here and are on a tight budget.
