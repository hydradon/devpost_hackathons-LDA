                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to manage large amounts of data, so the idea of using a database was just my first instinct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a program that allows users to register to a database and then checks whether tyhe user is in the database and returns true if it exists
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python for it. I used the hashlib library to apply a sha256 encryption to the passwords. I then imported that file into the storeit python file which runs the sqlite3 library in python and allows me to add and take information from a database. I finally imported the storeit file into the main file to give the user the option to register or login.
                </p>
