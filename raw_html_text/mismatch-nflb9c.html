                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students we recognized the everyday struggle that many young adults face when deciding what to wear. After months of personally taking selfies to approve our outfits by our friends, we decided to customize this experience to make it more fun. Through there came our idea of providing feedback to one's outfit by connecting an online community who would share their thoughts through a social media-esque platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website utilizes both a webcam feature to live-stream your outfit and receive instantaneous feedback alongside an upload feature where participants can upload pictures of their outfits to receive feedback and comments over time. We also utilized a leader-board in order to endorse our most popular participants on our website. Each of the forms on our websites connect to confirmations or other pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML5 and CSS to build all the different functions on our website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn from the basics of HTML so we had to stay wary of even small mistakes. Adding the camera feature was the biggest challenge that we faced.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of our project, we were able to implement each of the ideas that we hoped to put into our website. Even though we faced difficulties, we were able to figure out each of our challenges including adding the webcam feature to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even simple ideas can be developed to be very broad topics. We originally had the idea of live streaming fashion choices but through our team's collaboration we developed our idea much further. We added the upload feature, terms and conditions, a leader board and much more. Each part of our website is functional.
