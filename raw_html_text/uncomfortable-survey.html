                    Taking surveys is a dull and boring process. Mindlessly clicking boxes requires no thought on part of the taker, and the lack of interaction can be draining. We have reinvented the survey to push the taker out of their comfort zone.

                <p>
                    With open-ended questions, we require more than simple box clicking. Uncomfortable Survey is tailored to the user's answers, providing each taker with a personalized experience.
