                    In a limited amount of time as a sort of side project as I worked on our main project. I designed the model using blender, I'm a bit confused as to why my animator isn't detecting my inputs, but with more time I could have solved it. The original plan to make a multiplier pong like game where the characters are bears. The name would be "Bear Pong" and there would be a points/coin award system to buy different bears that would provide different states. The scores are tracked for only one of the players but the implementation is identical for the other. Overall I still learned a lot about unity and the different ways the same idea can be implemented.
