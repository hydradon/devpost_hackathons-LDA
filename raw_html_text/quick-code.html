                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use the codes written in multiples languages.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a platform to done your coding just like chatting where you can call required operations one by one so that the output of one operation becomes the input for next operation so it allows these modules to be written in multiple languages and these and by storing these modules in cloud one can have modules either written by them or somebody. and once your required task is done you can save the path you followed to make it as a new module for further use if you think it further serves as a new module.

                    How I built it
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not aware of the usage of cloud technology and API's and their interlinkings, by doing alone I felt connecting frontend to backend and retrieving data it's a good challenge for me.

                <p>
                    I learned the ways to connect the front end and backend and got some knowledge about usage of cloud technologies in an efficient way.
