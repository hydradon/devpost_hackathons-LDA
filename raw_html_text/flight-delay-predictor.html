                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the idea of processing large data sets that are freely available on the internet.
In particular, this project takes advantage of
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data" rel="nofollow">
                        this
                    </a>
                    data set of
roughly 5,000,000 US flights in the year 2015 which contains various pieces of information such as flight delays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application creates a decision tree using a subset of the flight data set, which is then used to predict whether or 
not a flight the user enters into a web form will be delayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have web server and decision tree back end that is implement in C# which is in charge of building a tree, training it, testing it, and classifying unknown flights using a built tree. Additionally this back end receives and processes requests that are sent by a web front end that is implemented using React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The flight data set that we are using is
                    <em>
                        huge
                    </em>
                    at over 5,000,000 entries. Since this data set is hosted in a remote database, there are issues that we have run into with both being able to process that many requests and being able to build a tree using the flights received from the database. We have tried different approaches to this to help improve our test accuracy (currently around 70-80%) including sampling only a small subset of the database and random sampling.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the amount of work we got done in these ~11 hours. Building a decision tree classifier that has reasonable accuracy and a web front end to interface with the server is an achievement that we are proud of.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the handling of large data, in addition to decision tree learning, and react apps

                    We are working to further improve the accuracy of our decision tree classifier.
