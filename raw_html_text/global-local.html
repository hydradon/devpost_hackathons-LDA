                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team comes from a diverse background of studies, ranging from STEM programs such as Software Engineering and Business, all the way to Non-STEM programs such as Business and Urban Development. As such, our collective knowledge and interests cross many industries. In particular, one of our members has taken a second-year Geography class and learned the value of tourism and the size of its industry. So, she brought up the idea for Global Local, and the team instantly connected with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Global Local is changing how tourism can be viewed today. Our program makes travelling accessible for the 70% of Canadians that want to travel but cannot due to their disabilities. Through Global Local, we connect the client directly to the tour guides, allowing for the safe planning of a personal tour around a new area. The client can book a tour with the tour guide through our program, and also maintain contact with them both before and after the tour.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built with JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, and the back-end has elements of Express.js and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our developers were relatively new to front-end development with React, and learning it had a bit of a learning curve. However, other members of our team generated mockups through Figma, which made it a lot easier to program with React, given that we had an end goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As developers, we learned to expand our front-end knowledge and picked up a powerful library. On a non-technical perspective, we created an effective solution to a problem that affects a large number of Canadians.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Global Local?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we want to continue enhancing the website and make it fit a more centralized theme. We also want to expand the program beyond Canada to larger markets.
