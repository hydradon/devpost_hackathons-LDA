                    Inspiration: We like video games and didn't know the first thing about building it so we figured a hackathon would be the perfect place to explore this new avenue.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It's a simple game which only requires the arrow keys for movement and the spacebar for shooting while avoiding colliding into anything.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Godot which had some demos of games. We used that to teach ourselves how the coding interacted and worked with the animations. We also used it as a foundation for our game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: It seemed like once we finally understood something and changed it up, something would crash or the change wouldn't make a difference during gameplay.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We came in with zero knowledge on the matter and we managed to make a workable game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Video games require A LOT of different functions which are interwoven multiple times into a very complex system which require a lot of attention to detail.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Final Hero: (Spoiler alert) The hero dies. We've made it nearly impossible to beat the game but all are welcomed to try.
