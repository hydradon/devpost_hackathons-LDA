                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking at the streets and nature around us, we realized that there is an immense amount of single-use plastics polluting our environment that we walk past every day. We wanted to encourage people to help clean up our planet, no matter how small their contribution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a cross-platform application that gamifies cleaning up our environment, rewarding players with collectibles and allowing them to earn points for cleaning up the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to build the front-end application, with a Flask RESTful API that receives images from users and uses the Google Cloud Platform's Vision API to identify whether the user has helped clean up the environment by putting away a piece of trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about building mobile-friendly designs and how we can design software to better target an increasingly-mobile market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrashTag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we would like to incorporate more ways for users to get points such as attending community clean-ups and making small donations to clean-ups across the world. We also hope to translate our application to a mobile application that can be downloaded from app stores.
