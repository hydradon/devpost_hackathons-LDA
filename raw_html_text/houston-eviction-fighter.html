                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though laws many states in the U.S. provide tenants moderate to substantial recourse against negligent or abusive landlords, many tenants remain at a disadvantage when landlord-tenant conflicts arise. Tenants facing eviction or living in poorly maintained buildings often under-utilize legal resources at their disposal.

                <p>
                    A chatbot inspired by the "DoNotPay" bot, which was originally created for users in Great Britain to appeal their own parking tickets.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot is designed to help you understand your rights as a tenant and empower you to take action from anywhere you have an internet connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the bot has collected sufficient information about a case, it can suggest a course of action for the user, and even (this part is currently being built) generate letters or court filings if necessary. It can also suggest points of contact for in-person legal assistance from a legal aid organization or reduced fee attorney.
