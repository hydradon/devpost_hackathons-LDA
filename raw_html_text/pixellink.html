                    Given an Image identify all instances of text present in it. This is useful for autonoumous cars that can accurately detect road signs. This is also useful for people with visual impairment that need help in reading signs and signals in and around their environment. The algorithm does this fast enough that a 60fps video can be recognized in real time. &gt;90% accurracy.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Rather than using the general semantic segmentation which introduces several challenges due to different charachters eing close to each other, I tried to implement a concept called Instance Segmentation. Tools used are python, tensorflow and opencv.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    It was difficult to understand certain parts of implementation of the paper which needed to be tweaked.

                    Test it with a robust dataset and maintain its accuracy.
