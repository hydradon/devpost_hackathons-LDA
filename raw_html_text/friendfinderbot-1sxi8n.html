                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was in the 5th grade, we had we were assigned a pen pal who was another 5th grader from somewhere else in the country. Today, pen pals is almost a dead concept. What if we could revitalize it, while also reimagining a tool of today, in order to cultivate equity and access for everyone tomorrow. What I mean by this is, by having random people around the world with similar interests interact with each other, we can promote a community of equity and access. By establishing these connections, we can live through one another across the globe.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, when you mention the bot on Twitter, it scans through your most recent tweets, and establishes a network of people with shared retweets. It then scans through those people's most recent tweets, and determines a connection between your most common keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the underlying Twitter code is written in Golang, and the service runs on Google Cloud Engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was coming up with an idea, but once we figured that out, we were all in agreement. Also, this is all of our first times using Golang.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First Twitter bot for any of us, the user association algorithm is developed by us, and first time using Golang
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How powerful Golang is as a language, and how surprisingly accurate our algorithm is at finding matches.
                </p>
