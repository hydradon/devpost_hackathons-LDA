                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always see online test taking systems that allow you to just open up another tab and cheat off of that. I wanted to make a test taking program that could prevent all forms of cheating. Eventually, we want our program to check to see if a student's phone is off, which is why students have to input their phone number when they sign up for ProtoTest.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ProtoTest, allows teach to make tests easily, and allows students to quickly take tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java in Eclipse with a library called WindowBuilder. We also planned to used Twillio services to connect phones to the application for cheat detection. Lastly, we used Photoshop to make the logo.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into is that we were not able to get the phone number cheat detection working within the 24 hours.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main accomplishment that we are proud of is that we got the program to convert a easy to read .txt format for tests into the actual questions being displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we definitely need more time than expected for projects using knowledge we don't have much experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ProtoTest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to finish our original concept for a Java Application and then publish it to the internet for all schools., make a web based version for even more ease-of-access.
