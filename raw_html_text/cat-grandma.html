                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user will play as a grandma in space, trying to collect as many cats as they can. To move, the user will use the arrow keys to move up and down. The health bar, located in the top left corner of the screen, will dictate the "time" the user has to play. Each time the grandma hits an asteroid, they'll lose health and will not be able to collect anything for 3 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to build this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cat Grandma
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cat Grandma will have more power-ups, more cats, more enemies and more stages.
One of the power-ups can make the Grandma go faster, make her invincible, or even recharge her health. There may also be a random power pack, which will give the user a randomized power-up. The game will also have grandma will be more animated, making movements when she gets a cat or when she gets hit by an asteroid. 
Finally, when the "game over" screen shows up, there will also be a leaderboard of the top 10 scores in the game.
