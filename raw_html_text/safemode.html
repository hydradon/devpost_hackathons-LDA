                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Esteban and I are both from Latin America. In there we have lived and seen how crime have been taking cities with the pass of time. Making it difficult for local police to manage the different cases that can happen in a day. 
At the same time, we are living the constant development of technology and the huge impact that social media has on society. For that reason, we wanted to join forces with a platform like Facebook, and create a Messenger Bot, SafeMode, that ables citizens to send photos of different crime scenes that they get to witness, so that SafeMode analyses faces, attributes, similarities with criminals' photos in a database, and "recreate" a crime scene on real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Facebook Messenger Bot that ables citizens to send photos of different crime scenes that they get to witness, so that SafeMode analyses faces, attributes, similarities with criminals' photos in a database, and "recreate" a crime scene on real time, by giving characteristics of the criminals. So that at the end of this analysis process, the different users of SafeMode are notified of the event with all the details gotten from the bot, and send the information to the police for more accurate study of the crime and search of the criminals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built by using the Microsoft Bot framework and azure to host our bot. And in order to get an analysis of the images, we use Microsoft Cognitive Services and return the information gotten by using Facebook Messenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Setting up the Bot Framework
-Interacting with the different apis
-Connect the bot from Azure to Facebook Messenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our bot to live in Azure and able to receive and send messages in Facebook Messenger with the images details that we get from the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We learned how to create a bot from scratch using the Microsoft Bot Framework
-Host a bot using the power of Azure
-Connect the bot with Facebook Messenger. 
-How to interact with Microsoft APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeMode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for SafeMode could be a real game changer for Latin American societies:
-Be able to analyze videos and get frames from it and get different tags from each frame in order to get a crime scene analysis on real time.
-Spread criminals information across social media
-Create an Amber Alert
-Update users with police information of persecutions.
