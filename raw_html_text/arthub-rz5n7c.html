                    The inability to find an online platform, that is easy to use, dedicated to art commissioning.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built the backend using node.js with relying on Azure Cosmos DB as our main database. We have developed the front end using react.

                <p>
                    Setting up Azure. Linking back-end and front-end. Time constraint. Lack of energy.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to incorporate the exchange and commissioning of physical artwork through having a shipping or pick up system.  Secure payment system, and NFSW filter.
