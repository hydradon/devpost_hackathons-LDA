                    Have you ever spent hours in a doctor's office or emergency room, waiting to be seen? 
Or how about being placed on hold while you wait to speak to a nurse about a new prescription?
                </p>
                <p>
                    People living with chronic disease frequently have these experiences as they struggle to manage their health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors want to provide the best care possible but they are handicapped by a system where it takes weeks to schedule an appointment.

                <p>
                    Cisco Spark meets HIPAA privacy and security requirements through end to end encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CoCocare improves patient care, increases patient engagement, reduces costs while improving the physician&rsquo;s bottom line.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    CoCoCare is not the typical diagnosis chatbot that identifies warts or the best treatment for a cold. A typical chatbot is not suitable for the complex management of chronic disease. CoCoCare uses a human in the loop approach. This augmented intelligence approach ensures patient safety by including medical professionals in the evaluation and resolution of patient's questions and requests.
