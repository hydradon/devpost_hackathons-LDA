                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Our program takes asks a user to log in to their Google account, in order to access their Gmail inbox. Then, it goes through the inbox and finds quantity and frequency of unique senders. The output is then visualized by use of the Initial-State visual API. The visuals generate a robust and stylized output that is easier to interpret.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We started with Google's Gmail service, which has API's ready-to-use with near seamless integration. Using this API, we were able to access the user's Gmail account, scan through each email in their inbox, and retrieve the sender's domain.
All of the driving code was created using python.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Figuring out exactly what data to display was a challenge, considering just how much the Google API can pull from an account. Inherit in emails, a sender's domain could very well be an alias, which would possibly skew our results. 
Another obstacle was pulling the information from the Gmail API and sending it to Initial State. Luckily, Initial State had very helpful tutorials on our integration method (from Python).
One challenge, left unconquered, is incorporating our program in an html page.
