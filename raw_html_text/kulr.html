                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon an argument over a colour of a shoe we found that this game would be fun

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a colour is given to the player with two options as to which is more correct in identifying the colour given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it is build as a HTML and CSS web application with Javascript back-end. No databases have been used

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an algorithm in javascript that picks out preferred colours and option answers as well as the back-end integration with the front-end on the localhost platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never used javascript and with very limited experience with HTML, we developed a base app from which we can build an immersive experience from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    understanding that the knowledge required for full stack development is really useful. Moreover bonding as a team was also very good with clear planning and communication in times of struggle.
                </p>
