                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was to create something useful, something, that not only could be used in real life but would actually improve peoples lives. Doing research on chatbots we came up with an incredible idea of creating a responsive educational tool which could read and analyze human emotions. That was the birth of Emory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of Emory is to educate people by making them think about the way they communicate with others. The program reads messages provided in text format and generates the reply based on overall emotion range, with the addition to that we are planning to develop the app so it could compare multiple messages and represent the way human emotions change over periods of time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of this project was to brainstorm all available resources and chose what we are going to work with. When we finally decided what we are going to do, tasks were split between team members and working alongside each other we accomplished most of our goals.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The task itself was quite challenging, the most difficult part was to implement Twist API's into our system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to Barcelona and being able to hack together a project in 36 hours for HackUPC!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an opportunity to improve our coding skills by completing the challenge and had a chance to use AWS services and various API's for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we accomplished most of our goals, Emory is still far from being perfect. We'll be looking forward to adding more functionality and improving the results accuracy, with possible expansion of emotion pattern range.
