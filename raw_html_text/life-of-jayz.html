                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was learning to code and was attempting to make the stupidest website ever for fun and i put down a box that said tell me about your dad because my cousin was telling me about her dad. Then I started thinking about my own dad and I was like "hey you know what? My dad is a pretty Kool Guy." So I wrote some stuff about him. I doubt he'll notice because he doesn't really notice the things I do which can be good or bad and also he doesn't speak English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it stands as a tribute to my dad and it informs people about his life and also is one of the best ironically designed thing I've ever made.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used Gomix.com and w3school.com to help learn and create my site.

                    Maybe I'll make another site for my nerd brother because he is also a pretty Kool Guy. I don't think I appreciate him enough and he is fluent in English so he will understand. He is just as important to me as my dad, but it's just that I thought of the dad thing first.
