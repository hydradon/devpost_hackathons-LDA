                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like looking up advanced stats before each baseball game, but I find Fangraphs, Brooks Baseball, and Baseball Reference difficult or impossible to use on mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project sends you 'baseball cards' via Facebook Messenger, showing the starting pitchers and their pitch usage, and could be extended to show cards for key players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a node.js API hosted on Heroku and using a few baseball APIs. We built a React front-end to render the baseball card.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was stuck on uploading images to the messenger bot, but that was due a finicky request library I was using. Rendering the card turned out to be trickier than we expected too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm leaving the hackathon with a bot that can show you 'cards' for any players, searching based on name and even handling multiple results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit about baseball APIs and messenger bots.
                </p>

                    What's next for Baseball Cards On Messenger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is not yet approved by Facebook, so to demo this app, please contact me:
                    <a href="mailto:richardpenner@me.com" rel="nofollow">
                        richardpenner@me.com
                    </a>
                    . Also, the 'cards' themselves are very basic. These could be tweaked to look amazing, and feature more stats.
