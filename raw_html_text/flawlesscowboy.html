                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halo Combat Evolved was THE game when I grew up. And through school, the novels held my attention. In particular, I remember 2 excerpts:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Give me a spotlight here. Prepare a sterilization field, and lower the ambient lighting by forty percent. And a little Mahler, please. Symphony number two.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Doctor.&rdquo; Music drifted from the speakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Halo: First Strike ~p. 151, Dr. Halsey to Kalmiya inside CASTLE base
                </p>
                <p>
                    She deliberated how to solve this problem, spun off a multi-tasking routine that listed her resources, and filtered them in a creativity-probability matrix, hoping to find an inspired match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Halo: First Strike ~p. 235, Cortana aboard Ascendant Justice
                </p>
                <p>
                    It'll take a while to reach those heights, but the first step was a blast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brings within reach of most comp sci people the ability to create and leverage their own Cortana commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, Windows 10 Universal App, AutoHotkey, and lots of ****ing swearing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drag and drop had pitiful support. I ended up writing extensive helper classes to fix that. Also, the app's environment was harshly sandboxed, which necessitated constant creative workarounds. Finally, Cortana's voice recognition activation is a black box. Debugging issues around it boiled down to perseverance(raging stubbornness).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a UI! With the quagmire of gotcha's the Windows Univeral App framework provided, that's something of a miracle on its own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scope... I attempted in 30 hours what would probably take 80 to do cleanly.
                </p>

                    What's next for FlawlessCowboy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple commands in the same sentence (as in the inspirational excerpts).
