                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea while eating our first lunch at HackRPI. We noticed that there's an increasing concern over food waste and came to an agreement that we want to build something relating to waste management and sustainability that helps solve the waste problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is EcoManager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EcoManager is an Android application that advises people on how to better manage their grocery shopping and recycle things they purchase and use, with an ultimate goal to help reduce food waste, contribute to sustainability, and make the planet a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make an Android application using Android Studio that would first scan bar code data for the products. The bar code information would be decoded, getting information about the product name and packing style. The ways for recycling packaging etc would be given via the application, and a generalized database would be used to set an alarm to alert the user when food is near its expiring date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we have achieved
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully implemented Android Studio codes of different version into one general file.
Though not all implemented, we were able to plan out the general algorithms that would be used in each part. A database was generated for general expiring dates of various food products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Lessons we have learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties calling the Edamam Food Database API using Java. 
Instead of having multiple people trying to work on one task, having team mates work on independent parts would help in the case of time consuming procedure, so progress would still continue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we can improve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to figure out how to incorporate the Food Database API as well as use advanced machine learning techniques and self-built natural language processing model to make customized and more accurate and detailed recommendations to users regarding waste disposal, waste management, and recycling.
