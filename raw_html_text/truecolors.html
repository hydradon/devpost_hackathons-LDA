                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a deutan, I find myself dealing with ignorance around the topic daily, and it's prohibited me from pursuing careers that I'm passionate about. We created TrueColors to spread awareness of deuteranopia as a new perspective instead of a limiting factor for careers, so that our society can begin altering integral parts of jobs to not be color based, and therefore discriminative against deutans, who make up 8.5% of our population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrueColors simulates deutan vision in real time, using Google Cardboard goggles for a more immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this by coding a C# script to access live camera view, and then applying a deuteranopia shader on top of the camera. We then made the program VR accessible and put it in binocular rendering to be compatible with our Cardboard goggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble putting all three colorblind shaders on one app (protanopia, tritanopia, deuteranopia), so we had to limit the app to be exclusively for deutans, which is the most popular type of colorblindness. We also had some trouble with the WiFi, which made downloading the necessary SDKs and Vuforia license keys difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we could figure out how to code in Unity with virtually no experience! It was a fun and challenging learning process, and the end result was gratifying. We expect to create more VR/AR programs in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to debug an Android phone, and we learned the ins and outs of Unity. One of us learned what it's like to see with deuteranopia, which was a great opportunity to spread empathy on this subject. Coding in AR was a learning curve for both of us, but through perseverance and determination, we were able to succeed in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrueColors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to include protanopia and tritanopia in an iOS app with a clean, user-friendly interface, with faster image rendering and less magnified binocular rendering.
