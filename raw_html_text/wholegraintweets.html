                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something for the #hackHarrasment, but would also be fun for people who haven't been harassed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot sends out encouraging and wholesome messages to users that sign up on the web page. You can also @ mention the bot, and he will get back to you with an encouraging message. When a user signs up, they can choose the frequency at which they get the messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was build using the Django Python framework, while the front end was basic html and css with a bit of javascript. The bot was built and python and continuously runs on an AWS server alone with the back end server. It utilizes twitter's API in order to update statuses and reply to mentions.

                        Configuring the project to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk was time consuming to say the least. Especially at 3 A.M.

                    <li>
                        Twitter apparently doesn't like it when you follow users repeatedly. Our testing account got it's writing privileges suspended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        some API docs were not very good.
