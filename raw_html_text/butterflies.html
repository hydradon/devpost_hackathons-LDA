                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people who suffer from social anxiety, which can be crippling in certain situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives suggestions on how to deal with certain social situations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using  HTML and styled it using CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone in the group knew html, so we had to teach each other. We originally wanted to build an app, but we didn;t know how.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logo is custom and so is the nav bar
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is a fun and rewarding language that everyone can learn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Butterflies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build an app for the future.
