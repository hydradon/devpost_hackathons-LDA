                    Grassroots Garden Network is an interactive web app that connects skilled gardener-farmers without land to land stewards interested in landscaping, farming, or gardening. We hope to make the most effective use of arable land, in urban and rural settings, by facilitating decentralized farming &amp; gardening.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Users create a profile and tag it with their interests and relevant skills. 
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Land stewards can create a listing for a land plot profile and tag it with project interests, for example organic apple orchard 2.5 acres, or home seasonal veggie plot 120 ft^2.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Users can browse land projects in their area and filter based on the interest tags, and network with other users with similar interests. Messages can be sent between users and to land profiles. The app interfaces with Google Maps API and will show land locations on our map. 

A resource page provides information on gardening techniques and a gardening cooperation contract form. 

The app has the potential to help facilitate community cooperation, increase the availability of fresh local produce in urban food deserts, and facilitate entrepreneurial activity in Ag by networking the right people.
