                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Abuse steals a victim's dignity. We want to enable victims to retake control of their lives. According to the United Nations and Amnesty International, 1 in 3 women are victims of physical and/or sexual abuse. However, because a majority of cases go unreported, the actual number of victims is significantly greater. In 2016, women still suffer  from economic dependency, cultural discrimination and social isolation. We want to create a tool that provides women a safe way to report domestic abuse without raising suspicion. We believe such a tool will decrease the number of unreported cases and increase perpetrators who&rsquo;re legally punished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empower is a victim empowerment tool. It deconstructs typical paradigms that enable abuse (biased judicial systems; unpunished abusers) by reallocating power to victims and anti-abuse networks. Here&rsquo;s how it works: Empower records photo/video evidence of abuse as documented by the victim. The evidence is then uploaded onto a cloud.  Once the photo/video are snapped into the cloud, the victim can delete the conversation from the phone. This security feature enables the victim to share her experience, since her abuser can&rsquo;t find photo/video evidence in her phone.  Then, by asking the bot for a review, the evidence feed is shared anonymously for a review with the support networks (NGO; activists; law enforcement; media, etc.). If a judge throws out a case because he&rsquo;s sexist. or if a police department mishandles a case, the victim has the ability to send her evidence elsewhere and trigger a network effect. The victim can then apply pressure to socially shame both the authority figures and also her perpetrator. By exerting pressure Empower enhances the likelihood that crimes don&rsquo;t go unpunished. Having access to a multi-faceted support network provides checks-and-balances to today's legal/emotional paradigm of abuse, and strengthens victims.

                <h2>
                    What makes Empower different
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Facebook's social networks to redirect victims to the ideal NGO/activist/lawyer regarding her case while storing the victim's evidence in a secure location. The NGO can advise victim on how to best utilize the evidence she's accrued on the secure cloud without necessarily exposing the victims identity. Empower helps people bypass politically rigid, misogynistic societies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a Facebook messenger bot based on ASP.net web api and hosted it on the Azure cloud.  Messages are then sent to the bot are uploaded onto a secure cloud location.  The messages are accessible via Empower&rsquo;s website.  The messages/photos are then presented as a stream of evidence.  The final page is a series of uploads.  Using the website, the victim can then access her evidence and determine where to send it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empower&rsquo;s initial dilemma was pinpointing a specific and efficient &lsquo;how&rsquo; to solving such a broad dilemma. We determined we must first give a victim a feeling of safety. We believe safety enables a victim's opening up to report a crime. Once she reports the crime, she takes the first crucial step in reclaiming her life. Consequently, she's empowered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empower fuses the best elements of technology and altruism to create an efficient way to improve the condition of women. Ideally, Empower's relevance would decrease the rate of violence against women.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that social good must be combined with people's desire for security, ease and connectivity. Just as Facebook's safety check feature delivers a clear message by the click of a button, we want to provide victims of abuse a quick tool to provide themselves with immediate support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Empowered by Messenger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empowered could broaden its reach and become an empowerment tool for anyone who experiences discrimination, bullying and physical/verbal abuse. It&rsquo;ll give victims an outlet by which to shame their attackers and to take control of the narrative of abuse.
