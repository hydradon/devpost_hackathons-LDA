                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we realized that insurance is a topic that is often seen as unapproachable and difficult to learn about. Getting insurance and finding the right one for a certain situation can seem scary and hard to understand, so we wanted to build a platform where a user could punch in appropriate information and find the most suitable information for them.
                </p>
                <h2>

                        1.
                    </strong>
                    Glass Wings creates an equal platform where anyone can share their information about what kind of insurance they have bought or encountered based on the environmental factors of their property
                </p>

                    </strong>
                    Glass Wings can predict the type of insurance and cost of it a user can expect based on the property they are trying to buy.

                        3.
                    </strong>
                    Glass Wings uses real-time data from actual users, raising awareness about insurance for individuals while simultaneously calculating insurance quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this platform with Python Django, then utilised AWS in order to train our model to predict the right insurance based on our crowd-sourced data. Not only is this trustworthy because it is based on real-time user verified data, but an individual can get a sense of how much everyone else is paying so that they don't feel they are being ripped off by a company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS's SageMaker and ML is not an easy topic to learn overnight. Using new technologies and a new concept was a huge learning curve, which made it a challenge for us to build the product we envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are tackling real-life issues. Environment is a hot topic right now because more and more people are becoming aware about climate change and the circumstances we are living in, and I believe that we are hopping on the right trends and tackling the appropriate issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team learned a lot about insurance. Especially as students in pure tech, we weren't too aware about the finance and insurance industry. We realized that these are real-life problems that everyone faces (we will too eventually!) so we understood that this is a problem that everyone should be more aware about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only this, we got to learn a good amount of new technologies such as Django and also ML techniques with AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glass Wings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve our ML model. Although we did train our set with some mock data, we would love to crowd source more data for more accurate and interesting information.
