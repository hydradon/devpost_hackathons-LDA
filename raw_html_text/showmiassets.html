                        Market: 4.8 billion by 2020 for existing enterprise asset management (EAM). A further $10-15B when you 
look at adding in sensor logic.

                    <li>
                        Asset Management is closed. Very little data is shared. Extremely poor integration and interoperation due to plethora of proprietary systems. Tools are not user friendly.

                    <li>
                        TM Forums mission is about increasing transparency between systems. This is a step in that direction.

                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re really interested in the world of asset management --&gt; when you think of the sheer amount of stuff we have around us, being able to track what&rsquo;s happening for all of these things would be amazing --&gt; I mean just think of the insights that could be generated from that kind of data

                    <li>
                        Took us a while to figure out how to properly train Watson to recognize specific images

                        Simple at front is complex at the back.  Creating an end to end service mission, business plan. Enterprise isn't a sexy market, but it has a huge number of problems that startups are well placed to address
