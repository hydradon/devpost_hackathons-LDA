                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a hack that focuses on a group of women that need empowerment that we felt aren't reached often.  This game is what we call a "PSA Game," in which the purposes is not to win or lose, but to learn and understand an issue that is ongoing in our world.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The morning is a big rush of getting kids ready for school and also trying to get yourself ready.  The game will run through this morning of 3.5 hours (5am to 8:30am) in five minutes to see if you can finish all the tasks you need to.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and C# (game)
Microsoft Azure and Python (server)
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the environments.  Tried to run microsoft azure in c# in unity, but had to switch to a python server.  Unity also was slow to learn how to use with 3d objects.

                <p>
                    Adding more details and tasks to the game to show a more realistic approach. Add more moving scenes for each ask such as a "cooking" sequence.
