                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something simple, yet funny. We think ZyBooks is funny, and during the summer, Alex once wrote a Tampermonkey script to cheat at the 5FastFingers typing test, which we also think is funny. So why not make a typing test based on the ZyBooks exercises we all know and love?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This typing test presents the player with a short Python script and must figure out and type the script's output, line-by-line, as fast as possible. When all lines are entered, the player sees the time taken and is then given another script. The player is done after typing out 20 script outputs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend also serves as a desktop standalone should the website be unavailable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alex wrote a C# backend program to randomly generate Python scripts based on code templates, and then run those scripts on a Python interpreter to get the output. This program sends the scripts and their outputs to a server database on Yourui's personal website. The website load a random Exercise and presents it to the player. The player types in their answer and the page presents their time and a sarcastic remark on the differences between humans and computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alex ran into the challenge of programmatically generating and running code. Yourui had no prior experience with half of his tech stack he is using (e.g. Vue.js and CSS)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our first online game and deployed it on a webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alex learned about HTTP requests. Yourui learned about frontend design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Typeout: ZyBooks Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more script templates for a greater variety of exercises.
