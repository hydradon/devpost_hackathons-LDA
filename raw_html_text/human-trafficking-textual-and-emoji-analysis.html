                            The City of Charlotte is plagued with human trafficking, averaging around 78 cases per year, making it the #1 city in North Carolina.  The inspiration for our project came from a workshop that one of our members attended hosted by an organization that provides assistance to survivors.  During the workshop, the presenter spoke of code words that are used within online advertisements for human trafficking.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            These ads are posted on various sites, such as Craiglist and Bedwatch, tends to contain keywords that allow them to camouflage among other ads.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            These keywords tend to change so it is difficult for law enforcement to make correct predictions on potential human trafficking ads.

                            Our idea is using machine learning and natural language processing to recognize key factors of human trafficking and generate datasets containing keywords and emojis.

                            Our original plan was to gather datasets and use machine learning to create an application that can through the sites and scan for keywords that could potential be linked to a sex trafficking advertisement 
However, as we were working on finding datasets, we were not able to find anything on human trafficking ads analysis. But we did came across studies that spoke of how there are little to no datasets on human trafficking ads. Though we have the tools to build the application that we want, we were missing datasets.

                            Therefore we had to explore the unknown and extract raw data from forums, websites and social media and came across a website that had ads with likelyhood of human trafficking to model our project and research which can be found below:

                        We further submitted our data under the MIT Open Source License in hopes that future researchers can help us predict human trafficking ads. Predicting of ads can allow for law enforcement to target the specific traffickers since they can come into contact with these individuals who often move between places. In addition, we made a simple web app to demo our project that will allow users to visualize and data engineered which will help identify future posts.
