                    Inspiration: Lack of actual smartness in most of the "smart" defined apps. The less the user needs to do, the better.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Redefines the concept of smart, through complex light and sensor usage. The system focuses at the users demands and devises single interlocked systems that power the "brain" of the house.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: With passion and ignorance of our bodies need to sleep. Now to the technical specifications: we used a raspberry pi as our control center and with the help of google API's like firebase and vision, we devised an interlocked system, consisting of graphical interface, to inform the user (smartphone), peripheries (lightbulbs and other electronics connected through bluetooth zigbee) and raspberry pi (brain of the smart home).

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Sleep deprivation, python coding (because most of us had to learn it in this 36 hours), hardware malfunctions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: achieving our goal of producing two functioning subsystems of the smart home. Building a strong connection between the team members.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: you should not stay up for 36 hours straight :)) We learned how to come up with ideas as a team, we learned how to work as a team efficiently. Moreover we learned new perspectives in this domain, like the present key development areas (smart homes, mobility, ai).
