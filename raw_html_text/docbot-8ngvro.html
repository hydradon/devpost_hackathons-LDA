                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once my sister was really sick and had a fever of 104℉. We searched through the internet for medications and the internet dumped us with more that what we wanted. We were confused and spent at least 30 minutes trying to figure out the right medication for my sister. After going through 20-30 medications, we found one that had good reviews. However our pursuit of getting the medicine was not over. We had to drive to the nearby pharmacy in the pouring rain in order to get the medicine. This really inspired me to create a chatbot that chats with the patient in a more friendly way and prescribes the right medications after going through a lot of reviews and ratings and create an order/delivery service for the patient in order to get their medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the common symptom and provides medication that was filtered based on ratings and reviews and when the author confirms his medication, it places an order at the local pharmacy along with the credit card information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JSON, node.js and IBM Watson Conversation API to create this platform for the users.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting all the nodes together was the hardest part. Researching and filtering the medication was also a crucial portion of the project.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project seeks to use speech-to-text and text-to-speech in order to make the chatbot talk to make it more natural and user-friendly. I also seek to have health datasets with combined symptoms and with the help of a binary tree, be able to provide medication for multiple symptoms, thereby making the prescriptions more accurate.
