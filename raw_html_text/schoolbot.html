                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It came about when we realized that was difficult to keep up with things relating to school, partly due to a lack of centralization in the process of how things are discussed. We then thought about how everyone has google assistant on their phone and how useful it would be to be able to just talk to google assistant and get all the information and forms the same way you would order a pizza through the medium.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects with a backend fulfillment api and allows students to join a school on our service and then once they do, they can directly ask google assistant things like, "what's the schedule for this week" or "Are there any updates" and Google assistant would automatically fetch the relevant data from the api and deliver it in a clear and elegant format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used dialogflow and actions with Google while also hosting the backend fulfillment on a Microsoft Azure virtual machine. We then created a system similar to oauth in which the voice assistant will give the user a code that they can use on the site to link their account to their voice assistant. This allows for a more personalized experience as we can then keep track of the user's school and relevant information as they ask for other things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get rich responses out of Google Assistant because we weren't familiar with the JSON based fulfillment system, but eventually after lots of failed attempts and incremental learnination, we finally figured out how to make the responses look as clean as they do
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks so darn nice. We spent so long trying to make each part of the process as easy as possible for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SchoolBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots! Maybe more schools and more types of info, schools closings, breaks,anything that makes being a student easier
