                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GGplot is hard. The syntax is hard to deal with to do the simplest tasks.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a user-friendly data visualization alternative that allows the user to
                    <em>
                        intuitively
                    </em>
                    plot the data, just how they want to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python backend and the ggplot library as the base for our graphs. We hosted on a localhost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't use Heroku. Image hosting was troublesome. We couldn't add in all the functions we wanted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solidified the baseline of our product and get the foundation working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a bigger project than we expected, and we had to break down the project to what was doable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Intuiplot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more plot functions and more customization. We will also incorporate natural language wit.ai API and have prediction options. Also, outlier detection and NA handling.
