                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are passionate about computer science and learning new things, and we knew that building a web browser would greatly increase our knowledge in C++, JavaScript, and higher level resources/APIs. Also, this is something we could use in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a browser built for developers that lets you run macros every time you visit a page. It also comes with beautiful and simplistic light and dark themes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the open source code for Chromium. The default dark theme we built was a JSON, and the extensions we made are in JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was the first time working with the languages, we ran into many issues. One issue we had in particular involved a face API. There was a variable that returned null even though we thought it was declared. We persevered and tried to fix it, but time started to run out and we had to start working on our second feature. We will definitely keep learning and will implement a facial recognition feature in the future.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we've worked with C++, and  Vagish, the member who made our website, worked with HTML and CSS for the first time today. We hope that our work and dedication will show and pay off tonight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of C++ and javascript. We also learned to go through apis and learn how to use a library or open source project. Finally, our information of HTML and CSS improved by creating a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dev Browser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making a desktop version that allows you to both login and logout of your windows account with your face recognition. We plan on making touch and face ID for more security. This will give us a chance to help everyone keep their information safe from hackers.
