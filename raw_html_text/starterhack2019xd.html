                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would be able to promote healthy eating in a convenient manner. We felt that other food tracking apps became too tedious to use so we wanted to create something fast and simple. By just taking a photo of what you eat, it would become easy and simple to use so we decided create biteshare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows the user to keep track of what they ate in a day through pictures. This allows the user to reflect upon the quality and quantity of their meals. The user can also record their weight and set how much weight they want to gain or lose to help them keep track of their goals. Finally, user's can view what their friends and people around the world are eating. This helps in inspiring people to make new, healthy foods.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It was difficult coming up with an ideas. We had to scrap multiple ideas before settling on this idea. It was also difficult using figma in the beginning but eventually it felt intuitive.
