                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Donald Trump's ridiculous and controversial tweets are sometimes nonsensical and it can be hard to decipher whether a real person actually wrote them. These tweets strive to elicit the same response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    @fakeDonaldTrump is a rip on the actual presidential canditate's twitter account, @realDonaldTrump. It uses several hundred tweets from Donald Trump's twitter history along with a Markov Chain algorithm to predict Trump's next tweet.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build @fakeDonaldTrump, I downloaded and changed
                    <a href="https://github.com/TehMillhouse/PyMarkovChain" rel="nofollow">
                        TehMillhouse's PyMarkovChain
                    </a>
                    to better fit my needs, then I used
                    <a href="http://snapbird.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        Snap Bird
                    </a>
                    to download the @realDonaldTrump's tweets. I then used
                    <a href="http://textmechanic.com/text-tools/basic-text-tools/find-and-replace-text/" rel="nofollow">
                        TextMechanics'
                    </a>
                    awesome RegEx functions to get rid of some of the junk like URLs, tweet dates, devices, etc. After that I wrote a simply Python script to tie it all together and let people see or even tweet their own ridiculous campaign slogans!
