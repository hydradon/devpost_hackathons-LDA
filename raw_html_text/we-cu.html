                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw multiple different problems with pre-existing commercial smart home monitoring devices, they required separate devices and also rely on your existing Wi-Fi network to function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We-cu (mind the Carleton University pun) monitors your home using a multitude of different sensors ranging from temperatures sensors all the way to a gas detector that is used for detecting smoke which allow you to remotely monitor the status of your house and also receive notifications via text message, push notifications or even have it post on your facebook wall if anything happens in your house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Particle Electron which is a IoT board that has support for 3G connectivity, directly connected to a range of sensors and also connected to our firebase database as well as tied into many of our connectors that provide a notification service as well as a monitoring service. We used C++ to code the particle electron and react-native for the mobile web app that allows you to monitor your house. In addition we used twilio API to send sms messages to alert you of changes in your home even if you do not have data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hardware hack that any of us have done before, we had to learn how to connect all of the different sensors to the particle electron and also properly handle the data that's coming in from all the sensors and also redirect them to the proper connectors that we have made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to present we-cu which is a fully functional independent home monitoring solution in 24 hours without any prior experience with using any hardware before (and also it not blowing up or catching on fire).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got to play around with a lot of different modules and the Particle Electron, learned the basics of building a simple circuit and also handling data from all of the different modules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for we-cu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would make a better enclosure for our system (maybe something 3d printed?).
