                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a program that directly impacts the people around us and ourselves. As high school students, a big struggle that we and our friends face on a daily basis is the difficulty to focus on our studies. However, during our 4 years at high school, studying well is an absolute necessity for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program enables us to interactively study and focus by giving the user something fun to do while helping them memorize.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was the creation of the collision class for the player model against the walls.
