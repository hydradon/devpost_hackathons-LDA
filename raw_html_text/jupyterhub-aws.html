                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore the open source community and get our feet wet with contributing to a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by exploring open issues on jupyterhub and began searching through open issues when we came across an absence of elaborated AWS Set-Up documentation for setting up jupyterhub with an AWS EC2 Instance using NGINX to proxy jupyterhub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by accumulating documentation on setting up jupyterhub for various platforms and compiling relevant information. We then looked into Amazon's EC2 set-up and found which AMIs and Security Group settings were compatible with jupyterhub as well as other specifications such as memory requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jupyter is an incredibly large code base and finding issues which we could understand and contribute to was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed our initial pull request to jupyerhub!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By speaking with Carol Welling we developed an idea of a structured approach to contributing to open source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JupyterHub AWS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The set-up process for jupyterhub using AWS is fairly involved, and next steps include potentially implementing a more automated installation process onto an AWS VM that is potentially compatible with other VMs.
