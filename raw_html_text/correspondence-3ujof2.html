                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't find a place to find a bunch of news from a bunch of different opinions, so we built one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Correspondence pulls top articles from a variety of different sources and sorts them based off of keywords. This helps group articles together over the same topic, so that you can compare the same story over multiple perspectives to remove biases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python 3.5 to populate a firebase database, and then used angular fire 2 to create a webpage displaying each topic sorted by topic and article.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever used angular, so getting the webpage to communicate with firebase and pull data from it was something we struggled with for a majority of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aggregate tons of articles and managed to sort articles by topic, and populated a database with that information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of angular, but not enough.
                </p>

                    What's next for Correspondence

                <p>
                    Getting the webpage to accurately display the sorted and categorized articles.
