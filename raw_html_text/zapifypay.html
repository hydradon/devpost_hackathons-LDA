                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When one goes shopping, time is normally wasted through long lines, sorting out money, and technical difficulties at the cash register's place.  We wanted to create a hands free paying system where you don't need to hold or give anything out.  This process can reduce frustration at lines and save time for shoppers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for contactless payment faster and easier than ever before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application on three platforms: website, iPhone, and iPad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding new concepts for the first time.  The geotracking and bluetooth aspect was the most difficult as it involves careful programming.  In addition, the hardware aspect of the DragonBoard was very time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We were proud of being able to incorporate DragonBoard into our project.
