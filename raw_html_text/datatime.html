                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see the world in a more linear sense, and really get a scope of how large and different the world really is
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Timeline to see events across the world and other statistics such as population, the stock market, popular music at the time, etc. dependent on country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a modular loading system, set up CI/CD and used Google butt services to build a scalable web platform for running applications, simply put there are three nodes running concurrently. Then we used Node.js for the back end of the project while also using Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS for the front end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had accidentally removed some of our important branches and were having troubles starting because of how back-heavy it was. Our team quickly exhausted themselves and most ended up becoming sleep deprived. Gitlab didn't play nice and refused to deploy to the domain, deploying only to a subdomain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use a total of 15 different API's and frameworks while building this project and also have not slept in a really long, long time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep deprivation is
                    <strong>
                        bad
                    </strong>
                    , also we learned how NodeJs Express works and also how to properly use NodeJs
