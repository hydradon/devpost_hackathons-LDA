                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My phone would often remain silent or on vibrate mode even outside of class. With the help of this application, the user is allowed to set a time from which the phone will start to be silent or vibrate. This app eliminates the human need to constantly remember to tun on the ringer after every class or meeting. Further development of this app will foster an idea of a repetitive alarms with multipile alarm times.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used research to come up with the code and reach a proper end. Our prior knowledge in C++ also helped to increase our understanding of Android Studio.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest issues we ran into was that we were so new to Android Studio. It seemed to be of a very far scope for us to properly understand what Android Studio has to offer. We are still working on advancing to a second screen, making multiple alarams.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the way my group and I adapted to such a new enviroment. We had no prior knowledge or experience in Android Studio yet at the end of 36 hours we were able to yield a functioning hack.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the ins and outs of Android Studio. I learened how the syntax for Android Apps works.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Silent Hours
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Silent Hours will become an application that will empower the user to choose a time frame in which their phone will be either silent or vibrate. We will further develop it to be able to handle multiple alarms.
