                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Autosense challenge had a wide area of sub-challenges, like physics, visualization, presentation and communication through webtechnologies. This was our motivation to choose this topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Solution takes json-files through an appealing Web-UI and processes them. The outcome visualizes the greates impact on the car during a crash and also presents some additional data like G-Force, time of crash and the offset in the time-series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also get just the angle and the offsetMaxForce through the api "/api/v1/getCrashInfo".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a Foundation we used a Sanic v18 Webserver to implement the API-Calls. In the background all the logical functions and classes are neatly implemented with Python. For the visualization part we decided to use OpenCV 4.0.
We also implemented the whole project as a Docker Container, so it can be deployed anywhere, anytime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add some
                    <em>
                        extras
                    </em>
                    to the project, we decided to build a small neat WebUI, there we used some basic HTML5, CSS and of course, Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics, to calculate the crash impact gave as definitely some headaches.
                    <br>
                    We got some weird values sometimes, that was because we ran into a transformation issues while transforming the x,y,z values with the oneG Reference.
After fixing these Problems, the visualizations looked more consistent.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We repeated a lot of maths and OpenCV which we once learned and forgot again ;-)
                    <br>
                    The Hackathon was a really good practice for us as a group, we learned how to interact better and more efficient with each other, to tackle a larger project like the autosense challenge.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we want to polish up our solution, also we would love to get some more crash data and some real-images so we can check if we calculated the right things. Also there is an Azure Webspace waiting for our app to be published
