                <p>
                    Interactive learning is vital in medical education. But far too often medical education is one-way (lectures), asynchronous (the teachable moment has passed), or random (not what the learner needs to know now). pBraindocs seeks to vitalize medical education and relieve an

                        The Problem
                    </strong>
                    Doctors and other medical professionals need to prepare, collect, and share knowledge resources in school and continue to do so throughout their careers. But there is no single tool to facilitate knowledge organization, collaboration, and social engagement in connection with these resources.
