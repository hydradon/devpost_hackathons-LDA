                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Politics in Australia and United States is becoming more polarised with numerous political stalemates in upper and lower houses of government. This extends to the general population with multiple surveys indicating left-wing people institutions to function properly this political needs to be addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we cannot influence events at the political level, we can offer novel ways for concerned citizens to access information in ways that do not reinforce confirmation within society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It aggregates news articles from a representative cross-section of news outlets to give a more wholistic view of events and lessen the political polarisation within society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask framework to construct solid structure to our web app and applied algorithms to generate user interface. This was combined with APIs to scrape website for news events and aggregate them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was implementing front end and combining  it with custom APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to assemble user interface despite no prior experience with from-end development within our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team collaboration also managing the tasks cooperatively. Also the importance of early-stage design validation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team-E
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement machine learning to our project to make the app more competitive and useful to the users also advancing UI to improve user interface.
