                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason why we wanted to create this project is because a couple years back my little sister was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  During those three years of chemotherapy, it was a really stressful time for me and my family. After this experience, I realized how important it is for patients to reach out to those going through the same situation. No one can really understand what is happening until they&rsquo;ve been in the same situation themself. Through our app, we are able to create a support system to help patients and their families to feel connected.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social media web application that allows users to login using their Google Account, create personalized profiles, send one-to-one messages to other users, and post on other users' public discussion walls.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used HTML/CSS for the frontend of web-application, Javascript/Java for the backend, and Firebase for authentication and one-to-one messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three out of the four members of our team had never been to a hackathon before and had not worked with programming languages other than Java. We also did not know how to use Firebase and had to learn through tutorials.
