                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about the verizon thingspace api and thought it sounded pretty cool.  We were all interested in getting our hands dirty with IoT, so that's what we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an android phone app, and PC Java interface to control many household devices including door locks, washing machine and light fixtures.  We have also created a GUI to simulate interacting with different devices in home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With JavaFX (a GUI framework), Android Studio and of course, the Verizon thingspace device messaging API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with http requests, a brand new foray for all four of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Producing a product that actually works, and gaining valuable experience in a technology/framework that we were excited about, and yet unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to successfully interface with a variety of IoT style devices using the dweet system.  Building a product and a team from scratch, making the best use of our selves and our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HomeConnect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logical next step would be to test it with physical, rather than virtual devices.  I think I speak for all four of us when I say that this won't be our last pet project with IoT.
