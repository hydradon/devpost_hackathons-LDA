                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During times of crisis, we rely our phone, SMS text, and data to function above all else. Unfortunately, wireless cellular networks could not withstand the spike in voice and data bandwidth when disaster hits a populated area. However, SMS or short message service can be used as the primary communication channel to reduce load on cellular networks. This app aims to provide a way to track and connect people with emergency using text so that cellular networks are available for emergency responders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app starts its life cycle when disaster hits and emergency responders recognize the crisis to send an alert to people in an affected area. The app opens on its own and asks if the user is safe or in danger. If the user selects safe, the user's family and friends are notified through text. If the user selects danger, the emergency responders are notified the users location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user is in safe mode, the user is able to receive alerts from emergency responders and notify authorities. Emergency responders can send alerts to users in specific areas to inform them on any issues. Likewise, users on ground, who encounter any issues, are able to notify authorities about any issues. If the issue is serious, the authorities can issue an alert to let everyone know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authorities are also able to assess the ground situation in real time on a map, which tracks people requesting help.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android app uses texts to communicate with a Twilio service which connects with the backend server. Authorities have a web app that communicates with the backend server.

                <p>
                    Test Twilio's broadcast service and bluetooth mesh networking as an alternate communication channel.
