                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love our computers. Like, a lot - so much that we can hardly imagine a world without them. But for people who have limited control in using their hands due to amputations or diseases like Parkinson's, a world without computers is the unfortunate reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think everybody should have access to opportunities that computers can provide, so we created a prototype that uses an Arduino attached to a pair of glasses to translate head movements into cursor controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Mobile Device Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For people who have disabilities affecting their hands, the inability to control a computer with accuracy and convenience can have a huge impact on their lives. By using a pair of glasses (a user-friendly and easily produced tool), our hack can provide a light-weight and effective solution to a really harmful problem.
                </p>

                        Uses an Arduino attached to glasses to send head movement data to a computer to control the cursor

                    <li>
                        Arduino attached to glasses picks up head movements using the gyroscope
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Motion data is relayed over bluetooth to the user's phone and used to control the computer's cursor
