                    We made a private virtual assistant that could help educate you without sending your information to a corporation such as Amazon, Google, and Apple, since all of the searches are being stored locally. It uses WolframAlpha python API to collect all of our data. Sadly, there are many places where kids and adults alike don't have access to a good education.
There are 57 million people who are not educated. There is no excuse for that. That is what Sherlock hopes to change .
