                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    January is Human Trafficking awareness month, so we wanted to create an application that would promote awareness and prevention. We came up with the idea of a suspicious activity website where users can post what they see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    .tech #beginnerhack #KPMG #Health #Safety #MentalHealth
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The feed displays the most recent activity that people post in your area. Users make posts and share their location to alert those around them of suspicious activity. You can also display the most recent official crime reports near you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and with a bit of help from Bootstrap. The back-end was made using a MySQL database paired with PHP, and the site is hosted by AWS Lightsail. User reports are stored in our MySQL db and queried with PHP to display onto our site in real time. We also displayed the City of Sacramento's Police Dispatch data in a separate real time feed using an API function call. Locations reported by users and police reports were marked on Google map snippets for each post, a feature we implemented using Google Maps JavaScript API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a reliable WiFi connection was our main obstacle. Aside form that, it took us some time to figure out which platform to use for hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this idea addresses a universal concern and we are honored to work towards alleviating it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MUCH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SusTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving the website full function that we planned and making an app!
