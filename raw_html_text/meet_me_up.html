                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we were frustrated with the limitations of group planners that are available today. These group planners were proprietary, time consuming, and most events are untraceable once the reference link is gone. We wanted to create an open source project to create a centralized group planner that fit our needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meet Me Up allows you to create and manage events with others through our website,

                    </a>
                    Once you register and log in, you can create and manage events that you are invited to, finding the most optimal times to meet for everyone!

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using basic HTML and CSS to create our website with a Django/JQuery backend, we are able to dynamically manage web pages for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the hackathon, we were unsure if we would be able to create a project of this caliber. However, as we were quite ambitious, we decided to attempt this project anyway.
Along the way, we ran into issues referencing React and Django, so we needed to scrap our ideas of using React and migrated the React components into Django scripts.
We also ran into troubles with url pathing, but we were able to find and redirect the broken url paths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud to have an MVP of what we envisioned our web application to be. We also set up ourselves for scaling without issue.
We are especially proud of our backend software as it was the most difficult component of our web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this project, we got to learn about in-house login authentication, creating dynamic components using Django, and managing user event information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meet Me Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, Meet Me Up hopes to improve our MVP to be mobile-compatible and improve the UI of our project to allow for easier usage for users. We also hope to spread our product to compete against the current preferred group planning tools.
