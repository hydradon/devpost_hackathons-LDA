                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this skill as we wanted to bring together the elements of game play as well as learning together to make it a complete fun as well as learning experience for the kids
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill gives the user five words in the beginning. The user is supposed to memorize the words. After that, it asks five questions to the users whose answers are among the five words narrated previously. The user has to remember the words and then apply the context to answer the question correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started building the skill as a memory game where the user was just supposed to remember the words spoken in the beginning. But, then we came across the idea of giving answers in the beginning and then asking questions later to make the game more interesting and engaging for the kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to look for a large pool of questions which would be relevant for the kids who are in their early teens. Getting and then curating those questions was a difficult task. This skill can bring along the whole family to make it a complete family entertainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a skill which combines entertainment and learning at the same time which can bring the whole family together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its was a challenge to develop a skill for kids just using a conversational interface.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working to add many more questions in the skill and add different categories so they kids can choose the area of their interest.
