                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has one of those days which go absolutely wrong and all they want to do is lie in bed and go to sleep. But the light switch is too far. And the day gets worse. But we are here to make it better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Switch on and off your physical light switches (or any switch!) from anywhere in the world through an easy to use Telegram bot or using your own voice and Google Assistant. And not just that, you get to save the environment for you can switch off your light on the go if you left it on before leaving your room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Telegram bot that is hosted on the Raspberry Pi which is connected to Arduino and the servo that changes the switch&rsquo;s state. In addition, we used the Google Assistant SDK to create a sample version running on the Raspberry Pi and further programmed it such that it would respond to specific commands (such as setting the light to turn on at a specific time).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial connection to the Raspberry Pi without internet was our teething issue. Following which, adapting the Google Assistant for our program in Python was a learning curve as well. Lastly, coordinating the alarms and timer functionality with the existing code proved to be a thorn in our side. But with teamwork and perseverance, we overcame these difficulties.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite being freshman with no prior experience in hackathons, and not being well versed with Python and hardware projects in general, we are extremely proud of what we have done so far and that we decided to give what seemed like impossible a shot :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to integrate different areas of programming together (e.g. Python in Telegram and Google Assistant SDK) and that the Raspberry Pi is versatile and can be worked together with even the Arduino.

                <p>
                    Further functionality for the existing switcher and expanding to other machines + further integration with Google Assistant.
