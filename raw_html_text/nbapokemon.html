                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining our common interests into something fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Comes up with a list of pokemon similar to different NBA players by comparing them to pokemon based on health points, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While some group members worked on UI development, others worked on gathering stats, while others wrote the code for the game itself.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unanticipated issues with backend python, versioning issues with our first project (the LeapMotion python API was no longer supported). This lead to a change in projects halfway through the Hackathon.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Getting the GUI to work for NBAPokemon and overcoming the stress of switching projects more than halfway through the hackathon

                    What we learned

                <h2>
                    What's next for NBAPokemon

                    Allowing fantasy teams of pokemon and NBA players to compete--pitting them against each other in a simulated pokemon showcase game.
