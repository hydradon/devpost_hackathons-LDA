                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a deck builder because searching through cards in the internet can be tiring, so having saved decks (whether they are complete or incomplete) creates conivence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows people to create, load, edit, and delete decks. There are 2 decks in the game, one deck containing 16 cards (known as the G Zone), and another deck containing 60 cards (known as the Main deck). When someone creates a new deck, one could type in a card name, and the name will be searched within the database dump given. Once the name is found, the card effects and pricing would be found. The pricing would come from another website and it API. After a deck is made, it can be saved by the user and loaded by the user. From there, the user can edit or delete cards. There is another option to delete decks as well. The decks will contain price totals once all cards and their prices have been identified.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio to create the application (to be later sent to my Android phone). I also used Sublime Text 2 to open the XML database dump from the Cardfight!! Vanguard Wikia.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge I ran into was opening a database dump from the Cardfight!! Vanguard Wikia. I was not able to open the database because my Unarchiver would not open it. So with help from a mentor, he was able to open and send it. The second challenge was how to get the pricing of the cards given, since it requires the API of another website- but only by request. Due to time, I was not able to get a request through.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was glad to understand about how to use buttons, background images, and searching through database dumps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about android programming. I learned how to create buttons and interactions, I learned how to get a background image to fit in the application, and I learned how to grab a file and open it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cardfight!! Vanguard Deck Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I plan to learn more how to read databases, and how to search for specific items- items such as card effects and pricing. To get pricing, I would need to ask permission from the website that own the API and work from there. More of this would be possible if I had more time to work on the project itself.
