                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To alter the direction of societies viewpoints on health. To create a health website that does not just focus on weight 
It sets a goal for body fat percentage rather than a weight goal that fails to take into account how body composition rather than just weight has a greater impact on health
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the users input of their body measurement, the body fat percentage is calculated.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website through Javascript and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time crunch led to limiting the purpose and the design of the website. 
We started with multiple ideas to create an app that could help determine a fat loss plan over a month. However, our limited knowledge in javascript only allowed us to finish creating a body fat calculator.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First hackathon that we started and finished.
Self taught javascript in 7 hours through Youtube.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to compromise with our limited knowledge on computer science and design.

                    What's next for Body Fat Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are to input the users ideal body percentage. Through that, a monthly/yearly plan will be set up to identify necessary steps for them to achieve their goal. Steps may include calorie monitorization, dietary restrictions, and possible workout plans.
