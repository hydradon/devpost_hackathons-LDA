                    To reduce apprehension when answering doors to strangers!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product is a raspberry pi with a touch screen, and camera attached.  When someone approaches the door, they can press a button to 'ring' the 'doorbell'.  The camera then takes a photo of the person, and sends this information to a Google Home.  The device then notifies the home owner of who is at the door by stating the person's name, if the person is known to the home owner, and notifies the home owner that a stranger is at the door.
