                    We have often seen senior citizens or people with disabilities (PWD) taking long to cross the road, with the green man changing to red before they get to the other side of the road. When the person forgets his/her ez-link concession card to tap on the reader, his road crossing time is limited. With a camera attached on top of the pedestrian's traffic light. the camera utilise computer vision to detect the age of the people crossing the road.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As long as any person is detected to be aged 55 and above, our system will increase the road crossing time by 15 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The camera captures in real-time the person's gender, age and whether bespectacled or not into the system database. Those real-time data are used for deciding if there is senior citizen at the traffic light holding area and will increase the pedestrian countdown timer by 15 seconds (or any seconds that is deem suitable for that area by the authority). Those captured data can be used for Big Data Analytics, such as the demographics of the pedestrians for that traffic light junction,

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft Cognitive Service framework with WPF and arduino.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interfacing from C# to Arduino for coordinating the 3 LEDs to stimulate the traffic light.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A prototype that can further improve and enhance the existing solution of the Ez-link card reader tap of a longer "green man" duration for elderly pedestrian.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned new technology such as Microsoft Cognitive Services and Arduino. I have also learned to work with new people that I have just met in this hackathon.

                    What's next for Green Watchman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be used for other use cases such as the lobby area where the elevator door needs to remain open longer for elderly people or PWD to enter the elevator.
