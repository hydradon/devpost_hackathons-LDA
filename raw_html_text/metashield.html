                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to improve the foster care system using technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MetaShield acts as a database solution for foster care systems, providing up to date information from a centralized source, about foster homes, foster children, and foster agencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MetaShield, in its final form, was built using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/JQuery, with the assistance of the Bootstrap front-end framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, MetaShield was going to be a blockchain project, however we ran into several problems which prevented us from completing the project on schedule. Therefore, we diverted to a database solution instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed the project even though it was not the way we intended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact we did not go with blockchain, we gained lots of useful knowledge in blockchain in our efforts to implement it into the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MetaShield
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few aspects of MetaShield still need to be implmented. For example, MetaShield currently lacks a login system, and a special interface for children. With more time, the user interface would be improved on as well.
