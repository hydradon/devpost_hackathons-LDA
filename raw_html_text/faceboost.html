                    Setting up and maintaining an optimal Facebook place entry is a lot of work. There are so many choices and fields to fill out. Then there are contents to create. What images to include? What words to write? This Facebook app will automate and streamline the process as much as possible by suggesting action items and contents for you.

                    User enters keywords with optional location and criteria such as ratings, rating counts, likes, checkins, or any permutation of the four criteria. The app then looks at contents plus data related to business and locations such as business hours and facility types. All this data is analyzed by a recommendation engine in real time to suggest the best action items and contents.

But the process to get public page contents seems bugged (

                    ​Brick-and-mortar stores are suffering due to increased competition from e-commerce heavyweights such as Amazon. When stores close, impact to local communities are significant and include tax revenue losses, real estate investment losses, malls being torn down and neglected, and job losses.​ ​In reality, offline retailers can compete with online merchants by using speed and convenience as advantages, by talking with the ​local community, and by customizing products and services for the community. This app shows ​​how location-based data can improve digital marketing outcomes.​ Figure 3, with title "Optimized sales funnel...", shows how analytics can help business owners see where marketing investments are most effective. The real impact of this app is allowing brick-and-mortar stores to compete with e-commerce tech giants. I look forward to partnering with local businesses everywhere in the world and use this technology as a tool, not to help super rich tech giants get more richer, but to help small and medium-sized businesses grow and thrive.​ Artificial intelligence and technology is used here not to take away jobs, but to help local businesses keep and create jobs.
