                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thought of music generation at 2 am, thinking it would be cool to try
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates music based on input midis, using short phrases within the music that is input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge of what defines a phrase within a piece, intuition about how to define the start and ends of phrases
Machine learning for generation of new phrases (still working on integrating with the current idea)
Machine learning for sequences of phrases
Git
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Organization of code
Complexity of Machine Learning and deficit of initial knowledge
Time Constraints
                </p>
