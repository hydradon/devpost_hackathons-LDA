                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Peace Corps needs a hub for all the resources that a volunteer may need, including apps and FAQ's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website includes links to each app, a forum and chatbox to connect to members, a calendar of events, and connections to all the Peace Corps social media.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had used a web server that would not allow log-in capabilities without payment, so despite having a working log in system, we could not connect to our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed a functional, visually appealing website that we believe can be used by actual volunteers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that PHP cannot be implemented on the free Weebly account, and that more research into the capabilities should have been done earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PCHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website would be moved to a different server and PHP would be used to add login credentials.
                </p>
