                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There&rsquo;s no good tooling for creating and growing image datasets for machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You&rsquo;re forced to use notebooks, scripts, or do it all via the command line. &ldquo;Sharing data&rdquo; means sending a 100gb zip file. There&rsquo;s no version control to speak of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting to a good model involves a lot of iteration - here&rsquo;s what a typical cycle looks like:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Get some images
2. Label the images with a class
3. Split the images into training and validation sets
4. Train the model
5. Figure out which images/classes the model was worst at predicting
6. Go find more images to handle these cases
7. Start again from (2)
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    There are
                    <em>
                        no good public tools for this
                    </em>
                    (but probably some nice internal tools at Tesla, Google, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Existing workflows
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>1. Create imagenet-style folders, where folder names are labels, and images are inside. Do the train-valid split via top-level &ldquo;train&rdquo; and &ldquo;valid&rdquo; folders.
                * Really easy to work with
2. Create train.csv and valid.csv files, where each line corresponds to a file in an `images` folder.
* Can easily extend to multilabel classification
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If you&rsquo;re doing the training on your local machine, you&rsquo;re good to go. If you are training in the cloud, then you&rsquo;ve got an extra step of uploading/syncing this dataset to the your machine before you can train. You also have to do this for all your changes!
                </p>

                    Solution - hackathon MVP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple react app that helps you create and iterate on an image dataset. Specifically, you can:
    * Upload images
    * Label images (for single-label image classification problems)
    * Do your training (fast, pytorch, keras, wherever you like)
    * See which images your model is performing worst on
    * Add more examples to cover those cases
    * Retrain and continue
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this tool, you should be able to create a dataset in
                    <em>
                        minutes
                    </em>
                    , send it wherever you need to train in
                    <em>
                        seconds
                    </em>
                    , and keep iterating on it extremely quickly.
