                    At Princeton, like on many other college campuses, students are very interested to know where they can find free food. Currently, the system works by students sending out emails about free food to a "FreeFood" listserv when they come across leftover food. However, with a deluge of daily emails, it can be difficult for students to be aware of free food opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hungry Hungry Tigers solves this problem by creating a current map of where free food is located on campus. Our code identifies emails about free food, finds the location on campus of the food, and plots in on a campus map to be viewed by the user. The dots fade and then disappear after a certain time has elapsed. This gives students the ability to identify how far away free food is and how recently the food has become available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extensions of Hungry Hungry Tigers include implementing the map in an app or on a website for easy accessibility by students. Ideally, the map would be interactive, with students being able to hover over a particular dot on the map and see further information about the location and type of food available. Furthermore, students could opt to get alerts when food is available in specific buildings. To expand past just seemingly leftover food, organizations could add to the map events or study breaks where food would be offered, to boost publicity and turnout. Ultimately, Hungry Hungry Tigers has the potential to be immediately impactful in many students' daily lives on campus.
