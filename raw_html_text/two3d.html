                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read about ORB-SLAM, a in a computer vision research paper earlier this year. We thought this paper was great and were very excited when the code was released to the public, we wanted to be able to run ORB-SLAM from our Android phones and decided to create TWO3D (ROScloud)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It streams video from the android device to our AWS server which builds a 3D model from the video. model is then sent back to a screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building the server, then we created the app and finally we started streaming data between the devices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ROS, getting the data streaming
                </p>

                    That we're almost done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ROSbags are hard

                    We'll see.
