                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore different methods of interacting with 3D models, rather than traditional Solidworks or Autocad. We thought using a hologram would provide a more wholesome experience and can be used to more effectively present ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application loads .obj files in an environment that interacts with a "hologram pyramid", which allows the object to be viewed as a hologram. To manipulate the 3D model, the application uses Leap Motion to register hand gestures that signal it to rotate the object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to set up scripts that use Leap Motion hand gestures to manipulate the 3D model, which is stored as a .obj file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty configuring the Leap Motion into the Unity scenes and environment. However, instead of having the Leap Motion actually interact with the object, we decided to explore and try to make the Leap Motion controller synonymous with the actual object, thereby avoiding needless interaction and difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of finally being able to configure the Leap Motion system into Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create scripts in Unity using c# and use the Leap Motion system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the technology and create a more user friendly experience with more interaction options.
