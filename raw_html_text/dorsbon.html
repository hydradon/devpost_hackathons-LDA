                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A healthy work-life balance is vital to productivity and happiness. However, as students, we know the back, neck, and shoulder pain that comes with it working on a laptop or computer. This pain often results from sitting with poor posture. We just need a reminder to sit up straighter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This software essentially tracks the depth of the user&rsquo;s eyes. When the software first starts up, the user calibrates this depth by sitting up straight with good posture through the webcam. Then, when the user slouches and their eyes are closer to the webcam, the computer detects this and sends out a notification, prompting the user to adjust their posture. Once the user adjusts their posture back to the original, perfect posture, the program will then notify the user that they are no longer slouching. A break timer reminds users to take a 5 minute breaker once every hour.
