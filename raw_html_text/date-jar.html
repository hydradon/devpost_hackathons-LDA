                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My wife and I always struggle to come up with fun ideas for date night, then when we do we can never agree. For our anniversary one year my wife made me a jar full of popsicle sticks with date ideas, for our next anniversary I turned it into an alexa skill, and now I've built on that basic idea and expanded it into a complex service that gives date ideas based on location, weather and local search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is designed to help make one of those difficult decision making processes a little easier - organizing date night. We've all had arguments over what to do for date night, or had trouble coming up with ideas, well date jar takes all the difficulty out of that by not only helping you come up with ideas for things to do on your date nights, but it also helps customize its suggestions basedbased on a number of different aspects and user needs. It can search for date ideas based on location (by zipcode), a specific city (currently limited to select cities), date cost, or type of date (such as romantic or adventurous). Or users can select a date at random.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it used javascript and AWS lambda utilizing the Yahoo Weather API and the Yelp Fusion API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating a number of APIs into the skill in order to filter out dates based on current weather conditions, or finding local date ideas with yelp integration was a real challenge as I had some issues getting it to work in the way I wanted with javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill now provides and astounding number of dates based on dynamic circumstances! I'm really proud of the skills ability to filter suggestions by current weather conditions and the current date.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating APIs into javascript can be a bit of a challenge!
