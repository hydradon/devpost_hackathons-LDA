                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build carelog, not only for the benefit of the provider, but for the benefit of the patient as well. By allowing patients to directly share their daily mood and a "lookback" for their day, both patients and providers can be advocates for one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    carelog allows patients to create a daily mood and "lookback" log, either as prescribed by their doctor, or as being a mental health advocate for themselves. Providers whom the patients share their mood logs with can see a day-to-day view of their mental health logs, as well as an overview of all of their patients. With an easy 1-5 mood scale, and a lot of room to write about their day, carelog is built to be a bridge between the patient and provider. Using Google Cloud Platform's Language Sentiment machine learning analysis, we are able to read patient's logs, and give providers a graph which relates the language they used with the mood score they gave themselves. This can be useful for diagnoses, as well as asking patients what they're thinking about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    carelog is built as a modern web application running an Express.js backend, using mongoDB (Atlas) as a database provider, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine for the server itself. Our frontend is custom scripted to work with our backend and is designed to work on all devices. Our domain name (carelog.online) was brought to us by Domain.com and is ran through CloudFlare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration between the frontend and backend is always slightly tedious, but our main struggle was with our initial planning and communication. If we had the chance to do this over again, we would more clearly communicate between each other what we are assuming regarding what will be handled where.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a fairly well designed modern web application for mental health advocacy in under 24 hours. We truly believe that this was a learning experience for all of us and feel that if carelog is continued to be developed, it could be a very useful tool for providers and patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully use a new library we've never used before, anime.js, to animate some parts of our website. We also learned how to effectively work together on the same project with three people--with all of us putting in relatively equal amounts of work. We grew together as a team and as a group of friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for carelog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we built carelog to be extensible, it could be used as a framework for any number of "Provider-Patient" logging applications. Specifically, our app could be extended so that providers have the option of creating custom logs for their patients, so that providers from many different areas of healthcare have the ability to monitor the well-being of their patients.
