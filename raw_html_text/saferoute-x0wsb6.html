                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to build a travel-related app. Wanting to stay relatively local, we started discussing methods of traversing Chicago. One of our friends brought up how dangerous his journey was from his home to his high school in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system. We decided to build an app that could help make journeys safer, by utilizing data available from the City of Chicago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeRoute uses an algorithm that we designed. We used the Google Maps Directions API to build a traditional, speed-focused route from point A to point B. Then the algorithm, using specialized marker objects that indicate areas of high-crime on the route, adds waypoints (sub-destinations) that alter the route, diverting it from the crime hotspot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript to leverage Google Map's existing API's. We started off with a blank map and started adding features such as heatmaps, time of the day heatmap, searching, fastest route, safest route and so on. Each feature involved some brainstorming and team discussion and then we implemented it out.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of challenges included learning which API's are useful to us and which aren't. We wanted some road API's to be in place but they weren't so we in turn ended up building our own map features using the existing google MAP APIs

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we got a product up and running and is very close to what we started out to build.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot of Javascript, teamwork and just how to have fun during hackathons.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To add machine learning algorithms to be able to accurately filter out irrelevant data and make predictive analysis and add a couple of cool features to the project. Ping us if you want to work on it.
