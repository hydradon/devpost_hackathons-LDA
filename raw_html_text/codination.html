                    Inspiration for this project drew from a major problem in the developed world, that it is not as easy for software engineers to cooperate and work on projects together. In today's society, from the youngest kids to the oldest adults learn and write computer code. However, it is not that easy to communicate with other programmers and reach out to those that are working on a project that may interest you. One can individually achieve a great amount, but working together has the potential to reach even more. Therefore, the idea for this project came in mind. I set out to create a platform that computer programmers from all over the world can use to reach out and work with one another. Every program is a step ahead to the future!
