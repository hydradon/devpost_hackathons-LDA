                    Our Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to implement computer vision to recognize different medication, then connecting it to a database to provide important details regarding the medication. PharmMed gives the patient a personalized way to track the medication they use for their needs, while being able to connect the records with a doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we did
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the website and front end working, as well as implementing Google Maps API to showcase nearby pharmacies in Long Island.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we would implement a chat bot to talk with doctors in real time, work out bugs in our Google Cloud Vision, utilize OpenFDA's database.
