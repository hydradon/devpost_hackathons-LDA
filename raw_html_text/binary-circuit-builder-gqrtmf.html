                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to build a huge computer in Minecraft, but the game is terribly slow for handling very complex redstone circuits. I wanted to make an easy-to-use program to simulate a huge amount of logic gates efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows you to combine logic gates to make complex behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Left-click on one of many logic gate types to select that, then left-click on the board to place it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Left-click on "Wire" to select wire mode, and left click and drag from one gate's output to another's input to connect them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Left-click on "Delete" for delete mode. Left click on a gate to delete it or click on an input or output to unlink any connected wires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Left-click on "Interact" to be able to activate toggle switch gates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right click and drag to pan the camera and use the mouse wheel to zoom the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java with libgdx for graphics and input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challeging to design a system which would simulate logic gates efficiently. We also weren't familiar with libgdx and making graphics with java.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm for filling the grid is super efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GIT and libgdx
                </p>

                    What's next for Binary Circuit Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add an ability to define a group of basic gates as one larger gate, and copy and paste this formation to make it easier to make huge creations. Also, saving and loading to files.
