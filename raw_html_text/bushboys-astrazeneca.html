                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My girlfriend goes past the same plant pot in preston that gets ripped out of the ground by teenagers on nights out. So she always replaces it when she walks past. Shes very in love with the planet and we can change the way others feel about REVIVING PLANTS. Besides it makes the air better for EVERYONE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made use of a Machine learning api, in order to classify different plants through the use of the camera. Users are able to create an account and log in. Used the google maps plug in to find the users location and add new plants on to the map. Each plant that the user adds, stores how often it needs watering, the amount of co2 the plant has absorbed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IN 3 Agile stages each all playable. 1. At first our plant objects and an implemented api to query plants using machine learning. Later Linked to GEO services and probability of plants being nearby. As well as building plant data based on the species.
