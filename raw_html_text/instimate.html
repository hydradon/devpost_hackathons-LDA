                    We began on a quest.
The journey was long and arduous.
                    <br>
                    You see, we wanted to find out the meaning of life--and in life, the only thing that matters is the number of likes you get on Instagram.
                    <br>
                    How many likes would my pumpkin spice latte pic get?
                    <br>
                    Or my selfie? 
Using an supremely complex algorithm, inspired by TSwift, we cooked up this app for you to use and predict the number of likes you'll get, so you'll pause and murmur, "Do I really want to post this?"
And ponder life.
