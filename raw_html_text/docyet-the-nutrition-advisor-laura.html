                    People are too fat and don't follow good eating habits. There are already advisors like are Arvato that you could connect to via phone, but its difficult to share data with them / give a complete picture.

                    Collects already available user data from different sources like apple health kit and fills it up with public open data to give a comparison how the user is doing in terms of health. Based on the automatically retrieved data our Bot Laura is doing follow-up questions to enrich the profile with more information w/o annoying the user with unnecessary questions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot is build in Ruby, uses NLP/NLU algorithms to interact with the user in natural language. The AI is not build / trained yet, but the interface - build with ember and Angular - is already working fine.

                    Multiple data sources / formats, beautiful design, context recognition

                    What's next for DOCYET - The nutrition-advisor Laura
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focus on building the intelligence to actually analyse the different data sources to gain insights about the patient and base automated advisory on it - not necessarily only in the area of nutrition.
