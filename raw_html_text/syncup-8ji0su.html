                    Connecting with people that have common musical tastes, especially those that are niche, is an awesome feeling that more people should feel.

                <p>
                    SyncUp takes your song and artist data from Spotify and runs a
                    <em>
                        proprietary
                    </em>
                    similarity function that weights song and artist popularity inversely to an overall score, so as to discourage matching people based on music everyone listens to. The algorithm focuses on trying to match you with other users that enjoy the same niche songs and artists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end is in React, matching algorithm is in Python, server is Firebase. GitHub pages?
The front-end is written in React and the website is hosted on GitHub pages, and it allows users to log in with thier Spotify account. It sends the users' Spotify data to a Google Cloud Firestore server. After the database has sufficient user data, we run the matching algorithm, which is written in Python and pulls data from Firestore. We then repopulate the Firestore database with users' top matches. The front-end then displays these matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The similarity function is an inverse-sigmoidal function that we've tuned to discount songs and artists with a high popularity scores, as given by the Spotify API. Every matching song and artist that two users share is added to a mutual similarity score, weighted by the Spotify popularity score as well as whether the song or artist is in the users' top tracks and artists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed mock-ups and branding in AdobeXD, switched to Figma because it allowed further collaboration between members of our team. We wanted our UI/UX to flow well with the Spotify aesthetic and user-experience.

                        Our original front-end prototype was in Node.js, so we learned a lot about that before pivoting to React.
