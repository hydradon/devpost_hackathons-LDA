                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know sustainability is important. It's imperative to leaving the earth a better place than we found it. How can we make sure the products we are buying and the clothes we're living life in are matching our values? There is not nearly enough transparency about what goes into a product in the fashion industry. We are hoping to get a little closer with our chrome extension.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple chrome extension that displays a sustainability and transparency index of the website you're on, based on a report done across the industry based on 5 factors.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the dataset from the study done on sustainability and transparency of the clothing industry, parsed the web content and displayed information about the study's findings on the company's publicity about how they make their products. Using JavaScript/Jquery and Chrome APIs, we organize the information to display on our chrome extension. Overall, you get a happy or sad turtle depending on how sustainable the brand you're browsing is! (with more information in the next tab.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this was our first time making a chrome extension!
A non-technical challenge was finding an objective way of displaying information to the user without subjecting them to anyone's own opinions/bias.

                    Moving toward a more dynamic route with web-scraping, product specific (how sustainable is this product and what are other similar, but more sustainable options?)
