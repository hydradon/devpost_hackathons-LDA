                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Centralized networks put immense strain on their services during periods of high load. This tends to be the case with services providing popular or trending content. The IPFS peer to peer hypermedia protocol aims to address this problem by providing for distributed file content delivery. IPFS may become useful for internet archivists aiming to distribute popularly accessed, archived content while also encouraging mirroring of this data.

                <p>
                    As a proof of concept, the app scrapes static HTML from a webpage and pins it onto a compute engine hosted by Google Cloud Services. In another incomplete form, it has the ability to temporarily pin files from any user on the internet.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is built primarily using Python3, the go implementation of the IPFS protocol (go-ipfs), and additionally, the in progress JS implementation of IPFS.

                <p>
                    This project took a lot of time to research and coordinate before work began.

                <p>
                    Our successful creation of a web page archiver which has the ability to push data onto our IPFS node.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What the IPFS protocol is, the ideology behind it and the way it's used.

                    What's next for Decentralized Web Site Hosting on IPFS JS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, this form of Peer to Peer Web Hosting protocol may be helpful in providing significant resource reductions in all kinds of services.
