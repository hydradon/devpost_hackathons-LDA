                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the tragedy that took place on August, 3rd 2019 in El Paso, we brainstormed ideas to help and give back to the community that raised us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows small/local businesses to promote their job opportunities free of charge. It allows people with low experience and low education to get a job in an easier way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no previous web-development experience prior to the hackathon. The time constraint was a big factor on how much was able to get accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning basic web-development and presenting a prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end development, software life cycle, and how to work on agile in teams.
                </p>
