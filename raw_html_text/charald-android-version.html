                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three things that humans need to survive: Food water, and cell phone coverage. But during natural disasters, all three can vanish in a flash. That&rsquo;s why we built Charald - the Bluetooth chat system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Charald uses connected Bluetooth signals to make a network that lets you talk to people relatively close to you. We have both iOS and Android compatibility so no matter your preference you can stay connected with your loved ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a design and branched out to building a website, android app, and iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many problems with Android Studios 
We were set back because half our android team couldn&rsquo;t get Android Studios to work and the same thing happened on the iOS side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website looks absolutely amazing and even has registration/login capability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to use and troubleshoot with Android studio as well as the environment for xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Charald
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we weren&rsquo;t actually able to get the Bluetooth functionality to work, our next step would be to get both apps to be able to detect other Bluetooth systems near by. Then we would work on getting the chat system between the devices working.
