                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was a VR 360 video on Youtube where the watcher could choose where they wanted to look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to listen to the book while being able to see what the main character is seeing by looking from right to left, or up to down. It also allows the user to make their own story, as there are buttons that will change the story line based on your preference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recorded separate clips, following a script that we wrote. Then, we compiled all those clips together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the begging, we only had 2 people working on this project as our other teammate was working on something else. This caused a trouble as it was difficult to film while also reading the lines for the narrator. Not to mention, every time we messed up, one of us would burst out laughing ruining the clip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, in the end we made a video that looked decent. We also figured out how to compile the clips together without long pauses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how VR works and how we can trick each of your senses into believing something that's false.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR incorporates 2 out of your 5 senses if you use it at home. However, is it possible to Incorporated the other 3 senses too without going to a different place?
                </p>
