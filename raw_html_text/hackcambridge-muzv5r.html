                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need to combat the isolation that can come from digital technology, combined with the need to help minority groups improve their english, resulted in PRO-nounce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows users to record mp3 files. Each file is passed to the server where azure speech recognition is used to convert the speech to text and analyze it against the word of the day. If it matches, the user gains a point to their score. The leaderboard keeps track of the scores of all the users. At the end of the day the top 50 users get regular stickers to recognize their achievement, the user in 3rd place gets a bronze sticker, 2nd place gets a silver sticker, and 1st gets a gold sticker.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using keystone.js I was able to easily set up the backend. After that I worked on styling the frontend using HTML and CSS. Lastly, I integrated with azure speech recognition to validate the recordings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have enough time to implement all the features I wanted to implement. For example, speaker recognition of the recordings to ensure each recording from a user is coming from a unique person so that users don't record one person multiple times and get points for that. One of the main aims of the app is to combat social isolation, this is difficult to achieve if the user isn't forced to go out and find multiple DIFFERENT people to record. In addition, one of the main features that must be implemented is the ability for the user to edit their information. I also ran out of time but will hopefully implement both of these features and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to come up with a unique game idea and execute a very large chunk of it in a short period of time. I've also never been responsible for a website's backend, so I'm proud I was able to get it up and running.

                    I learned how to use keystone.js mainly.

                    I would love to implement the speaker recognition feature mentioned above.
