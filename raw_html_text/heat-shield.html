                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this product is the wildfires that have affected many human and animals lives in California, Australia, and other places across the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heat Shield harnesses the power of a mesh network to create the world&rsquo;s first scalable and sustainable early wildfire detection system.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team used react.js for the frontend and node.js for the backend and rasberrypi with multiple components for the hardware hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi did not support analog inputs so I had to connect it through serial to arduino which could support the temperature sensor input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heat Shield
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to actually implement a fully functional mesh network and improve on the technology along with the dashboard.
