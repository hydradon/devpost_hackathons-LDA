                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom was my inspiration for this idea. My dad always forgets about what she asked him to do, due to the workload and he usually has to go back out and complete the task.One day she asked me to make something to help her and BuyMeYouMust was born.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geo-location integration with chores and remind people of task while on the way.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are building it using android studio and have a prototype of the website up too. The project when finalized will be accessible through web services and android application. 
We also used the free web domain card to build this :
                    <a href="http://www.buymeyoumust.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.buymeyoumust.com
                    </a>
                    which will be developed soon. 
We used wordpress to make our prototype for the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning curve that comes with Android studio. Understanding how gradles work. The project was bigger than 24 hours hack. We should have started smaller. 
Trying to figure out the best way to implement the features we wanted took us more of the time. 
Troubleshooting in Studio wasnt easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all the challenges and lack of sleep we are leaving here smiling with a lot of knowledge of android studio. And already have made plans to continue developing the app even after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know gradle building now. We learned how to pair program so that one person types while other corrects him/her if they see any bug. the "bug catcher" testing the code written by the partner consistently.
