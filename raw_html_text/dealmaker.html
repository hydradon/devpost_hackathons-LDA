                    A brand-new fin-tech approach to a match-making app. Deal Maker takes away the awkwardness on discussing the touchy subject of personal finance in dating.

                    Apart from the traditional matching criteria in main-stream dating apps (e.g. age / geo location), our matching algorithm bases on an overview of a user's spending habits to determine the compatibility between one another on the platform. Deal Maker will challenge a user and their potential partner with a little test before they are off to their first date. The cost and the division of a first date must be agreed upon the matchee discovers their compatible profile.
