                    Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, today we will be introducing our app for the very first time. Hold onto your seats, we are introducing &ldquo;Hydrotank!&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m Jennifer and next to me you&rsquo;ll find my teammates: Kelly, Kimberly, and Elyse. Before we get into the specifics of the mobile app. Let&rsquo;s address some of the modern day concerns that my team based our application on&mdash; dehydration. We focused on the issue of health since this is something everybody can relate to. Whether young or old, everyone wants to be healthy. Now, before you is a glass of water, nothing more, nothing less, something that many of us take for granted. As we all know, roughly 75% of our bodies are made of water. Dehydration remains a serious issue today symptoms include: fainting spells, increased infection rate...and many more gruesome consequences including death in severe cases that I am not going to go into. Now many of us in the states do not suffer from severe cases dehydration. But how can we keep track of whether or not we&rsquo;re drinking enough water to be healthy in a fun and innovative way that does not include primitive tick marks or relying on the generosity and fickleness of memories?
