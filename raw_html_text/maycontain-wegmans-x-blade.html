                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have worked with AR in a previous hackathon and were very excited when we saw the Vuzix Blade. Knowing what foods you can eat when you have allergies can be a struggle, and we figured we could leverage the Wegmans API with the Vuzix Blade to help alleviate these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an Android app that can run on the Vuzix Blade or an Android phone. Using the built in camera, the user can scan a products barcode and see what allergens are in the food.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Vuzix Blade runs on Android SDK 22 (Lolipop 5.1) and the support for the Apache HTTP ended with SDK 22 with a very messy breakup. This resulted in lots of headaches mixing different snippits of legacy code to allow us to make requests to the Wegmans API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other main challenge we faced was the fact the the Wegmans API allergen list returns an empty array for all products. This is a error that Wegmans' can't control so we decided that we could instead parse through their convenient ingredient list, and make our own "database" of ingredients that correlate to allergies.
                </p>
