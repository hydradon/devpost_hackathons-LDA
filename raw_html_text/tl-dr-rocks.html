                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're inundated with massive amounts of data, documents, and other digital information on a daily basis. It's exhausting. Wouldn't it be easier if a computer could help you get through it all? TL;DR ROCKS makes it easier to sift through the heaping pile of web links one encounters every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user of TL;DR Rocks either (i) inputs a URL into the form at our website, enters her or his contact information, and presses "Submit," or (ii) texts a URL to (917) 268-8696. Either action will summarize the website and text it to the user using Twilio and the Microsoft Graph API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JAVA and Scala for our backend language to push the request to a summarization API online. We then used Twilio and the Microsoft Graph API to distribute it to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the API network was challenging. But perhaps the greatest challenge was linking all the different components together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How we managed to connect so many different types of services to make it into one flowing work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about programming than coding. Inter-linking was the biggest challenge, especially with APIs we weren't familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TL:DR ROCKS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, the summarization API will be smoother and more efficient. Also, branching out our network to greater lengths to boost efficiency and productivity.
