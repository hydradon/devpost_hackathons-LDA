                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started out with simply wanting to better our own diets, with an app that helps track our intake and recommends our next meal. As we thought about who would benefit from this app, we realized it could be a tremendous help to those recovering from eating disorders. We didn't want to make just a health tracker that discourages eating or forces people to eat and diet a certain way. We wanted to encourage healthy eating in a happy and positive way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be sure that app users, especially those who believe their mental states prevent them from leading a healthy diet, were not also feeling pressured, the focus of the app is around the user's emotions. We ask questions about how well, tired, or stressed they feel, and recommend healthy foods that may help boost their moods and energy. With a description and a real reason why the food can help with mental health, we want to leave the users feeling like eating and eating well is their friend, not a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with a HTML website that is mobile friendly, and converted it into an app with phonegap. To build the database, we had to hard code the information into javascript. Javascript was also used to create an algorithm that determines which foods to recommend. This depends on the time of day, as well as how the user feels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was building a database that has information with foods. We wanted to store the food information on a database such as MSAcess as it is an easier way to manage data entry and calculate the result. We did not find a way to convert MSAccess into CSV so we hardcoded our current food database, and currently the data is hard coded. In the future we want to know how to better accommodate for those with eating disorders and getting accurate food information by getting advice from certified pediatricians, nutritionist, and psychologists.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of the team had different skillsets that definitely have grown and developed this past weekend. Our team made a goal of designing an app or website from scratch at the hackathon when we first signed up to come. We all feel very accomplished because we developed a website together and also turned it into an app. Each member stepped out of their own comfort zone to rise to the challenge of achieving our goal and developing ourselves together as a team (and individually).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that to use local files we need a server which leads to the problem of databases. Most of the team members are beginners so we familiarize ourselves with HTML/CSS. This was also our first time completing a website with the backend and frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HappyHealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many future improvements in mind for our project. We can make sure we gain valid information from psychiatrists about nutrition and psychology. We want to let our users know more in detail about the nutrition breakdown of the foods that are suggested. It would enhance the experience for the user if recipes were influenced by emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our financial improvements would entail partnerships with food companies such as Amazon Fresh so that ingredients for the meal can be shipped to your home. 
We would update the app that would also keep track of how much food you have and when you may need to order/ buy more. Possible expansion with also Blue Apron.
