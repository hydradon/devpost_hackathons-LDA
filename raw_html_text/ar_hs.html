                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day I was taking a really hot shower... and an idea suddenly hit my head! Why not have YuGiOh! or Magic in 3D! But then I realized I was a poor University student so I decided with a cheaper virtual game, Hearthstone. Now that I think about about it... I've probably spent more money on Hearthstone than other games.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know YuGiOh? Where you play the monsters and the holograms shows up and you duel? It's like that, except with Hearthstone.
