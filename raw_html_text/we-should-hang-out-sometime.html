                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having experienced the busy-ness of campus life, where people with similar interests often have conflicting timetables, we wanted a way of meeting new people with complimentary time availability and interests easy. Without the awkward small talk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should hang out sometime takes information from a user's calendar to work out their time availability. It then compares their availability with other users availability. It then filters the potential matches by similar interest scores. Finally WSHOS would send a notification to both users to let them know that they have a strong match available at certain (a) certain time window(s).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node, PWA, React and Mongo to create a skeleton web and mobile application (with CSS). We then integrated a user login verification, so that users could log into We Should Hang Out Sometime using Facebook or Google. Using their Google account we are able to access Google Calendar to work out the users free time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are still in the process of building of the interest matching component.
For MVP v1 the user would fill in a form which gives them a score in different interest areas. We would then compare user 1's score with other users scores to determine the most compatible match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our target state would be to use information from the users' social media to generate the match scores. We would also use machine learning to refine the match process.
