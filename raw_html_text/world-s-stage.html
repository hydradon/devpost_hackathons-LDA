                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People across the world we may speak different languages, but music and dance are art forms that we can all share. They bring us together, but it is difficult to experience culture that exists mainly on the other side of the world. With our app, you can travel at the touch of a button. All the world's a stage, and our app aims to bring it a little closer together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app creates a geographical representation of dance cultures throughout the world. When given a song, our webapp will utilize the YouTube API to search the site, grabbing the most popular videos in cities throughout the world. The results are then displayed in Google Maps for the user's convenience, allowing easy access to a myriad of unique reactions to a popular song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stephanie worked on the front-end of the website, including the Maps API, ensuring the user had a seamless and fun experience. Her most interesting accomplishment was hacking a multiple-marker initialization function, where one could mouse over a city and access the YouTube link for its most popular video. Tyler then wrote the pseudo-backend using Javascript, while also developing the YouTube search function. Initially, we wanted to use Firebase to handle server-side development, but it turned out to be simple to go with a serverless architecture - Tyler was also responsible for much of the data exchange between Javascript and our HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was the final handshake between the Maps API and the YouTube API. Because Javascript runs asynchronously, our map attempted to load before our search even started, leading to a seemingly impossible problem wherein all values were undefined. However, thanks to our problem-solving and dedication (and Chrome Dev Tools), we were able to isolate the problem and alleviate it with hours to spare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though the bugs were difficult to squash, we are very happy that we were able to complete the entire project. It was very satisfying to see our ideas come together - while our plan diverged from our original idea using Firebase, it was still an excellent learning experience. In total, we are most proud of being able to utilize Google APIs for our own unique and creative purposes; any crazy idea we came up with, we were able to make a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The quirks of Javascript were laid bare during this project, especially including its asynchronous loading strategies. Besides forever stereotyping Javascript as the odd child that you love anyway, we got a lot better at using Git to synchronize our tasks. We also learned a ton about using the different Google APIs, and will definitely consider using them again in a later hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World's Stage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited to try out music recognition API such as Gracenote. We would also like to rework our algorithm to ensure unique results for every city (as of now, different locations may have the same top song).
