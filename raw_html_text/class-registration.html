                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hate planning our schedules. There are too many time conflicts! That's why we wrote this program to eliminate the tedious planning process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program assumes days and times for all classes available to engineering freshmen and, depending on whether or not the incoming student has AP credits, selects a subset of courses the student would like to register for. Our algorithm then generates possible schedules for the student that don't have any time conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carol and I are both beginning programmers, so we really hope that all our hard work shows in this project. We spent a lot of time working out the algorithm in python _ while learning python syntax at the same time _.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We literally did not know python before coming to BostonHacks. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your outlook), we have experience in MATLAB. Our biggest challenge thus was learning to code in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are actually submitting something for our first ever hackathon! We literally did not think we would get this far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that, through perseverance, even mildly impressive things are possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Class Registration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision Class Registration at the point where incoming freshmen can text class requests to a phone number run by Twilio, and Twilio will respond with the possible schedules.
