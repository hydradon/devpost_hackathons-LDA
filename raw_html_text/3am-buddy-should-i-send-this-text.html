                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I sent a dumb text to a friend during the hackathon as I was coming up for ideas; I wish I had a "proofreader", and then I thought semantic analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs semantic analysis (AFINN) on static text entered in a web text form. It then gives a score (out of + or - 10) based on how "positive" or "negative" the text entry was. Based on this score, the app gives advice on whether or not you should send that text on to your friend. (It also fully supports emojis)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's purely a front-end client, so I used ReactJS for the UI, and a npm module called SemanticJS to bootstrap the semantic analysis process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never programmed in Javascript before this event, so juggling learning that, and navigating the weirdness of the React framework was pretty frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (somewhat) learned ES6 Javascript, and got really into the React framework by the end of my project. I think the accomplishment that I'm most proud of was seeing correct "scores" generated for various text inputs during the first time I tested the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Javascript.
                    </strong>
                    As I said before, I had never really programmed with it before, and I'd never touched React before this.
                </p>

                    What's next for 3AM-Buddy (Should I send this text?)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I had time I'd love to build a back-end for the website using Django, and storing (anonymously) some of the "best" user inputs the site.
                </p>
