                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the classic arcade game
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" rel="nofollow">
                        Pong
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two players duke it out by trying to bounce a ball into their opponent's "goal," a hitbox that follows their head.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR Pong is built in Unity using the Mixed Reality Toolkit from Microsoft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was an unconventional hackathon for our team. Most of the challenges we faced were in familiarizing ourselves with the development environments (Unity and Visual Studio) and figuring out how to use the not-completely-documented Mixed Reality Toolkit. We spent a lot of time on things that in past hackathons usually took an hour at most (such as configuring the HoloLens emulator, which was excruciating), but that's just what happens when you delve into unfamiliar, undocumented, and somewhat buggy territory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to scrape together a mostly-working product given the many limitations we faced. We effectively started hacking at around 1:00 PM and were without a HoloLens from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next day because Microsoft employees needed to be around for us to hack on it, making this more of a 12 hour hackathon given the amount of time it took to get familiar with the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about developing for the HoloLens, which includes working with Unity, C#, and some basic game dev.
                </p>

                    What's next for AR Pong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement an AI so that you can play singleplayer.
