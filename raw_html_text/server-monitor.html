                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came after I was running a server with a scraper that had a bad memory leak and used up all the ram in a day affecting other services. Being the noob I am, I was not monitoring my server and wished for a tool that somehow notified my before my other services were affected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to make a simple tool that monitors my servers and tells me whenever their disk, memory and processor usage reaches a critical point. It sends me a message whenever that happens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a simple ruby script to extract the vital information, I check the percentages with the thresholds and send a SMS whenever it is above it using nexmo.
                </p>
