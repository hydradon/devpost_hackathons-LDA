                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed a trend of professors getting rid of lecture material, whether ir be erasing a white board or throwing away notes after using a docu-cam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoteSavior provides an easy way for  students to gain access to lecture material. The teacher simply inputs her schedule and the app switches between the classes depending on time of day. The teacher can then have her camera set up such that she snaps a picture every time shes about to erase or trash lecture material. The picture is then uploaded to a database where her students in the class have access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in android studio using python and xml. We also used firebase to store our data structure online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a very difficult figuring writing our program in an asynchronous environment. Dealing with the database was major challenge and understanding how to write asynchronous code  well was very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the interaction that we were able to accomplish between our app and the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were very new to android studio and online databases, so we had to learn a lot about the android environment and how we could store and interact with online data.
                </p>

                    What's next for NoteSavior
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to continuing work on this project! we didn't have time to implement many of our ideas and we were excited about them so we  will hopefully keep working on and advancing this project.
