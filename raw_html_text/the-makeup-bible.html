                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makeup allows a person to express who they are. People wear makeup for many different reasons. Some want to feel more confident, while others feel naked without it. Alana and I love to enhance our features and we wear makeup because it is
                    <em>
                        fun
                    </em>
                    . We were inspired to make an app that would help beginners learn the basics of makeup. They will learn from product reviews and different tutorials for the perfect application. We want people who are new to makeup to experience the world of makeup and be introduced to this new world through our Makeup Bible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides tips and tricks to help the users improve their makeup skills. We give the user the opportunity to discover holy grail products that will get them started with makeup. The app features products we like to highlight that we think embody the makeup world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Ionic Framework which allowed us to make our app deployable to multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
We used HTML, CSS, AngularJS, and NodeJS to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we tried to make changes to our app, the online browser would not refresh so we were not able to make changes to our app. We had to start over from scratch deleting some code or an image to make the app refresh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of this hackathon we had no programming or coding experience at all, but after getting the introductions to coding and through trial and error we were able to make the code to program our app. We are extremely proud of ourselves. We came up with our content and our ideas are ones we have discovered on our journey through makeup. We learned how to design our app and make our content and designs blend together. We definitely could not have made this app without mentors who helped us get started and who assisted us along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code and how to utilize the hacks for design. We learned from our coding mistakes and were able to improve upon the layout and design of our app. We overcome certain challenges, like learning how to code but it was worth it. We are still learning how to code and the hackathon we attended was a brilliant introduction for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Makeup Bible
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate more user-user interaction and some more user-app interaction. In the future we would like people to be able to post their own reviews of products they have tried. We also would like to have a place where users can send in content, like tutorials, tips or tricks, and more that could be posted to our app. We also would like to add polls and bring the beauty community together by using The Makeup Bible.
