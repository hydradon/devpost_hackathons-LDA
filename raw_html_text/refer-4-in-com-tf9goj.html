                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were fooling around and talking about the high amount of rent ATL offers, we came up with an idea to easily collect money for not only financially burdened college students, but also for the majority of people. Most people neglect about the referral bonuses because they don't know any residents; however, the bonuses can be easily and safely collected through our application. Further, they can connect with their future neighbors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This model will connect current resident of an apartment and a future resident of the same apartment so that they can collect the referral bonuses, which about 70% of the residents fail to claim. While allowing the residents to gain easy profit, this application seeks to increase the demand of that certain apartment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the web application through the MEAN stack, and deployed via AWS Lightsail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us has ever fully developed a web application before, and this caused major delays where trying to learn about asynchronous calls (Observables).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While people use our system, we found a novel way to keep people from lying using game theory. We have based our application on a smart contract model in order to generate benefits for all parties involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With three developers with passion, we learned that we can literally build ANYTHING while having FUN.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for refer-4-in.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, our website will establish connections with apartment complexes so that we can take more advantage of the smart contract system. If the apartment complex agrees to send the referral bonus to us, then future residents can be more comfortable that they can receive their share of the bonus. Through smart contract, we will keep our promise 100% of the time, as opposed to a random resident, who cannot be trusted. The end result will incorporate blockchain technology
