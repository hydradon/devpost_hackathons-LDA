                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted ads to have a realtime feel, and it should be a plug and play entity. The mood and the behaviour of the user is one of the major accounts from which an ad should be displayed. It should not just be relevant but it should also have corelations with what you are doing in realtime. It should always try to sell you stuff, but should also assist you in making better decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a plugin which can tag along most of the webpages and make it ready for a complete behaviour analyser. Each of the webpages connects to single server and records user behaviour and finds most appropriate ads on the central store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are tracing users based on hot points earmarked for content analysis, this is what makes a plug and play code for behaviour tracing. We apply NLP techniques to find relevant tags and contention ratio.

                <p>
                    We build a plug and play code which is kind of awesome :)

                    We will continue our hack spirit, we have taken up a huge machine learning and artificial intelligence project in our current final year. We will ad insights from InMobi hackathon to add value to our final year project. Keep Hacking
