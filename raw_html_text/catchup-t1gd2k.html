                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shared universe is a growing trend in TV shows. In particular, Arrowverse has four shows that frequently crossover with each other. It is great as long as we are watching as they air. However, when someone wants to catch up, it is extremely hard to keep track of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional TV trackers keep separate progress for different shows, our app can merge spin-off shows' progress and keep track of them all at once.
