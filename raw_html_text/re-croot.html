                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We observed that in job interviews the interview process is heavily coloured by the opinions and preconceived idea of both the interviewer and the interviewee.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack aims to mitigate this by providing a challenge that ca determine teamwork skills, response to failure and other personality characteristics that affect how you work in a job environment. We do this in the form of a game, where the goal is to collect as many points as possible with the aid of your team members.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the client in electron.js and the server in node.js, I then connected them together with a physics engine and input handling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was unable to complete my hack to my satisfaction due to my entire team not providing anything, nor attending anything other than the first few hours of the hack. I struggled to complete everything in the time period
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt from scratch how to make a game, connect a client to a server and work comfortably in node and electron and was on my own able to submit something despite the problems i had with my group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what a team environment is like and that you can't pin everything on your other team members working as expected. I learn't many new skills in terms of networking, input handling, node.js and electron and I gained valuable advice from mentors throughout the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Re-croot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to finish building this so that it achieves all the goals i originally had for this hack.
