                        one of my friends told me about Ballmer's Peak and said an app like this would be very useful and entertaining to people who are familiar with the phenomenon

                        By giving users the ability to input their own desired BAC, we provide a tool that helps users drink more responsibly

                    <li>
                        Most, if not all, of BAC calculators currently available in the app store and as websites do not calculate the rate of drinks per hour for a user to maintain their BAC.
