                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I missed my flight to the hackathon and was too dead to build out what I wanted to do. I tried to offer my help to other teams, but it was really hard to find someone who needed help, and everyone was keeping to them selves. I thought, it would be nice if there was a way for people to post what they need / want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to post what table they are on, and what they need,  so that other's can drop by for a chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DevHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm pretty sure things can be done better than how DevPost does it. DevPost really has no features for activity or interaction, which is what hackathons should be all about.
