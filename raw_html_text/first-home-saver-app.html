                    Millennials are on a home buying streak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data from Realtor.com shows Millennials made up a whopping 46% of all mortgage originations in September&mdash;up from 43% a year before.
                    <sup>

                    With interest rates low and incomes up, it seems that many have decided that it&rsquo;s a good time to make their move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, many people who would like to buy their first home are facing real challenges. Low inventory has caused starter-home prices to skyrocket in some markets. But even in places where homes remain more affordable, many first-time buyers are in a tight spot. They continue to pay monthly rent to a landlord; they may be saddled with student loan debt; and they may have little or no savings for a down payment on a house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can easily take three years for a cash-strapped Millennial to save up enough money for a down payment.

                        2
                    </sup>
                    So, are these potential buyers motivated enough to save for three years? Surprisingly,
                    <em>
                        Millennials rank homeownership as one of their top goals in life&mdash;higher than even marrying or having kids.

                    </sup>
                    And yes, they are using their own savings to fund the majority of their down payment.

                    Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s hard to save money, especially when you&rsquo;re on a tight budget. Like achieving other difficult goals, it takes willpower and sustained motivation. You need to stay focused on your goal, monitor your progress and see that it&rsquo;s working. And it really helps to get encouragement and stay excited about the end result. When it comes to saving for a down payment on a house, Bankrate recommends that you set up a dedicated savings account.
