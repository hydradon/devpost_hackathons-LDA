                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we don&rsquo;t think too much about how infrastructure impacts the way we live our lives. Unalerted icy sidewalks or a dimly lit alleyway could pose as an inconvenience or potential danger to a person&rsquo;s life. Living in the age of information, we believe that the spread of knowledge through community is very important if we are given so many resources that could provide a safer place for every day living. Though this project is only focused on the local areas of the users, these small reports can provide a way for incremental impact &ndash; logistical analysis to improve infrastructure, safety, and awareness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SusMap addresses the problem of infrastructure by providing a map of all pinpointed data collected from users. With this data, users from around the local area would be notified of the locations (longitude/latitude coordinates) of hazardous, suspicious and accessibility issues. When a user submits the information, they will choose what type of activity (hazard, suspicion, accessibility) they would like to report, and under that activity they will choose a subtype (for instance if the user choose hazard, they can then report what kind of hazard: slippery stair way, or icicle droppings). This would be submitted to the database that we have set up with Firebase. Our database stores each data entry, which consists of 5 fields &ndash; description, latitude, longitude, type and subtype &ndash; in individual documents. In order to keep track of how many incidents have been reported in the same area, the algorithm will tally each time the coordinates match up or are within proximity to one another. These counts will also help us access the credibility of the reports &ndash; the lower the count after a certain amount of time will lower the priority of the report.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is built on Esri&rsquo;s Feature and Map APIs. This played a huge part in the foundation of our code because it gave us a user interface to work with geolocations to pinpoint the different issue areas. We bounced back and forth a lot on whether or not we should use Javascript/HTML or to create a React.js app and just add a map on top of that. After speaking to different mentors, we stuck with what was known best by majority of the group: Javascript/HTML. We used Firebase to create a database to store our data on the cloud. This allows us to easily add and retrieve data after asking for user inputs. Then we used the App Engine to deploy our web application.

                        Challenges we ran into:
                    </strong>
                    Although we were using Esri&rsquo;s Feature and Map APIs, a challenge we had was deciding whether or not we would use React.js or Javascript/Html to implement our project. After speaking to different mentors, we stuck with what was known best by majority of the group: Javascript/HTML/CSS.

                        Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of:
                    </strong>
                    We're super excited that we were able to successfully utilize and integrate Esri's APIs into our application. In addition, we were able to host our project on the Google Cloud Platform. Lastly, we're proud of designing our project focusing on UI/UX first, allowing for an easy to use and seamless experience for the user.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a beginner team in web development, we all had to refresh our skills and/or learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript. In addition, we learned so much about integrating API's into our project. In addition, we learned how to test and deploy our web app using Googe-compute-engine and Google-app-engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for SusMap?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to turn this into a mobile app for better accessibility and to create an easier way for reporting and retrieving data. We would also like to create a function that would allow for interested parties, such as school administration and government officials who overlook public work, to query the information in the database in order to make any necessary improvements.
