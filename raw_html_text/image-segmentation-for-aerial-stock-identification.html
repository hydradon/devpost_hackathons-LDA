                    Drones in stock are kind of useless at the moment. I'm trying to find a use for one. Stock estimation in a relatively controlled environment is a good start. Using relatively well known image segmentation methods for identifying animals from their background, eliminating noise and useless image information (sky, for example) and then hopefully a form of regression analysis to bring a number of image passes down to an estimate.
