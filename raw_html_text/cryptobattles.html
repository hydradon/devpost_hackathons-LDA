                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use Voronoi's regions because I think they are a cool visualization. I thought it'd be really cool to have them change live based on some stream of data. I ended up using a Treemap instead as Voronoi's regions are not the best use way to represent frequencies (but distances instead).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows beautiful tiles that represent cryptocurrencies being traded live. Ideally, in times of high volumes, they would be fighting for the biggest area on the screen.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    D3, hosted on Google App Engine, uses Flask for the back-end, as intermediary between D3 and the financial data API provided by GDAX (Coinbase company).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many. I had to learn D3, Google App Engine, Flask and countless hours of debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first submission after 4 hackathons. I also basically finished the project, given my obstacles on the way. SUPER PROUD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technologies mentioned above, and probably a good deal of debugging skills. Also that I can code for 16-18 hours straight (ish).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CryptoBattles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uhhh, ideally have it stream data using WebSockets instead of a REST API, and using more hip frameworks, such as React, or WebAssembly, and asynchronous calls (NodeJS back-end &amp; stuff). Also, it'd be nice to use it for stocks, twitter (to visualize the most commonly used words for example), and other things.
