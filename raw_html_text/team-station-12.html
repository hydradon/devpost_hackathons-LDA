                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an application that would increase AB InBev's sales, manage inventory for the point of contacts, introduce new products, and make the sales process more efficient (75% of a sale presentative's time consists of visiting a POC's location).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows POCs to order with a click of a button without sales representatives having to visit weekly. The application also suggests how much should be ordered based on data provided by AB InBev analyzed against sporting events, holidays, local events (over the same time period) scraped from various sites and APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to build the mobile application and it calls the data from a proprietary database.
