                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first thought about the idea for hackillinois, we were 100% sure that we will have healthcare related data. As we looked into more data, we found dataset with hospital name, paitents survey response and corresponding its score. Since each observation had embadded longitude and latitude, we wanted to display each hospital in the map. We also wanted to add interactive website where user can search any information about hospital from sql database we have achieved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website visualize and search hospital base on survey responses from patients. User can find different map with different questions asked to paitents. User can freely manuver around the map and look for any hospital that is resigerted in our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we obtained API and manipulated data using python and stored the manipulted data into our postgresql server. Using Anguler for front-end and .NET core 2 for back-end, we hosted website with map displaying each hospital with their average survey rating and survey response rate. User can also search any information and table will filter those information dynamically. We seperated different map with different question that hospital asked that users can look at different criteria. We mainly focused on getting data from dataase and visualizing the data using user interactive graph and table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using map library in python was one of the challenges we faced.
                    <code>
                        foclium
                    </code>
                    library we used had lots of error and exceptions that we needed to debugg majority of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of data visualization and very user friendly map where clients are able to manuver around the map easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole bunch of stuff. We learn how to build an application from the ground up. Everything from spinning up a database, to spinning up a back-end, to spinning up a front-end, to purchasing a domain and connecting it to a front-end. Phew. Plus we learned how to map and analyze a huge set of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Discover Your Hospital
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would use more variables and try to discover interesting patterns. We would also like to add user interactive where user can input zip code and the map changes zoom and area with desinated zip code.
