                    Website that allows police/trusted officials to report crimes/accidents in the area of cupertino (works globally though)

                <h4>
                    APIs used: Google Maps JS API, Google Maps Geocoding API, Google Firebase API
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Google Maps JS API - used for displaying the map along with its data and accessing the map's data
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Maps Geocoding API - used for converting the address text input into coordinates usable by the JS API (geocoding)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Firebase API - used as data base for police logs of crimes/accidents, works in realtime, helped in displaying past logs, keeps a record of past logs effeciently on the cloud.

                    What we did
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Created an interactive website containing a toggleable map interface and another interface below for the police to input any crimes/accidents, specifying the location, type of incident, a description of the event and the severity of the event. Any police submission shows up as a marker at the specified location. All markers indicate some sort of logged event, data from this is all stored in the database keeping a log of data for display of past logs. The markers, when clicked, display the details of the event.

                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        User Authentication (OAuth) to ensure that only trusted individuals can edit the data and others can only view the data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep track of time in program, allowing for only recent entries to be shown and old ones to be deleted from the database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cluster data when zoomed out enough, allowing for cleaner data visualization (heatmap from api or markerclusters)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add preset descriptions/filler data for quick input
