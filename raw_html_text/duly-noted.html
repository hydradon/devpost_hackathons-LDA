                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Hearing impaired people not being able to effectively take notes in a lecture

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the use of the Google Web Speech API, we are able to track the words being said by a lecturer. We store these words into our application and parse them to search for certain key words such as "for example" to organize the notes and emphasize important points. This all happens in real time. There is also an option to export the words to a pdf file for future access to the notes.
