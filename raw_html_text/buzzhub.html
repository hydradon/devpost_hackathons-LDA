                <h2>
                    BuzzHub was inspired...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    by a popular high school academic activity called Quiz Bowl, in which teams of four use buzzers to compete against each other on various topics. Its intended use is to serve as an alternative to actual buzzer systems, which tend to be complicated and are also prone to damage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    BuzzHub uses...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    sockets to create connections between multiple devices at a time-- namely, one moderator, and several players. The moderator provides players with a specific, randomly generated key, allowing for multiple games to occur at the same time. Updates occur real-time so that the moderator is notified as soon as a player hits their buzzer. Once a player buzzes, all others are locked out until the moderator resets the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The biggest issues I experienced...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    in creating BuzzHub were successfully deploying a server to host the games (for which I eventually used DigitalOcean) and also figuring out how to work with back-end programming languages like Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    I'm proud that...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    within a 24 hour span, I was able to create a functioning program using two languages that I previously had no experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    One of the most significant things I learned...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    was how to work with back-end programming, which is actually just as important as front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    I hope to integrate BuzzHub...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    into the Texas Quiz Bowl circuit, and to create functionality for Android devices in the near future.
