                    With Freeman Lou as the lead developer doing the bulk of the work, our team has created an fun banking and educational website for teenagers.  The name of the website is called:  YoungMoney
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website has scored quizzes that improve teenagers mastery of fiscal concepts.  There are scenarios in which account holders are able to walk through and see the results as well as answers to account transactions in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Jquery, the CapitalOne API, Microsoft Azure, to complete this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YoungMoney is important because of the seemingly ever increasing dire financially straits that our citizens are finding themselves in.  Here are some staggering statistics which highlight why we need to break this cycle as early as possible:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Approximately 26% of adults have no savings set aside for emergencies, while another 36% have yet to start socking away money for retirement.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            As of 2013, the average bank account balance hovered around $4,436.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            An estimated 38 million households in the U.S. live hand to mouth, meaning they spend every penny of their paychecks. Surprisingly, two-thirds of them earn a median income of $41,000, which puts them well above the federal poverty level.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ***  Millennials, fair worse than all generations in terms of saving.  Meaning adults who are 35 and under, have a personal savings rate of negative 2%. Between high student loan debt and stagnating wages, saving anything at all proves to be impossible for many of them.
