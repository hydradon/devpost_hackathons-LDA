                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the numerous amount of opportunities in America relative to other countries there are so many Americans in debt. I've always wondered why and I wanted to build a free tool that could offer some kind of individualized, tailored advice to best fit their financial needs and help them get out of their financial jam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application was designed to provide customized financial advice based on the information the user provides and generate a downloadable table in PDF format of all of their monthly expenses relative to the income that he/she nets every month. Using Chart.js the web application will dynamically generate a graph as well for the user so that he/she is able to visually see the seriousness of certain debts relative to others and allow them to proceed accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example if the difference between your net income and monthly expenses is huge, you would get a strong message from the web application with some specific links for further information. If the difference is moderate you will get a lighter response from the application but still strong. If the difference is small you will still get advice but it is not treated with the same severity as with a higher difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the front-end with HTML5, CSS3, Materialize CSS and used PHP and MySQL for my back-end. I managed to integrate the front-end with the back-end but my PHP script was not working properly with MySQL which I will explain later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Although my PHP script successfully created a connection with the MySQL server it would not execute the SQL query and insert the values into the MySQL database. This simple problem took up 80% of my time. This was and still is a big problem because the storage of the user's financial data is the crux of the web application. I also need to retrieve this information so I could dynamically create the chart with Chart.js.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wanted to export the financial data as a JSON file and XML file from the database as well. This wasn't possible because of #1.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I'm familiar with Materialize CSS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'm better with PHP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I know how to create a connection to a MySQL database with PHP.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Materialize CSS and using PHP and MySQL together. I also learned how to set up an HTTP server locally.
                </p>

                    What's next for Budget Analysis and Money Management Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does not stop here. I will figure out how to get the data stored in the database and from there it should be relatively straightforward because I can retrieve the fields that I want with PHP and manipulate the data with JavaScript to create the chart.
