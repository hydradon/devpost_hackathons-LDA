                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally have trouble gaining and maintaining my weight, but If I had a structured meal plan of what to eat that is good for me then I could use it. Also since the theme for this Hackathon was diversity I think it's a great project for everyone because everyone has a diverse set of needs because we are all different, but that is good because we all have a similar struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps people to calculate their daily caloric intake needs based off of how active they are and their current biological attributes. This does not yet tell the user what foods to eat based off their AMR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using Android studio, Java, xml, JSON
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into getting the json to appear in the app from the key given, and also I have trouble creating a list of meals for a given meal plan
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how much I coded in short time, but also how much I learned from attending my first Hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there are so many ways to achieve a given result. I learned how to access Internet to allow JSON to be accessed in my app. I learned how to use spinners and radio buttons, passing data between different activities using explicit Intents.
                </p>

                    What's next for GoodEats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the meal plan generate meals and also maybe incorporate other micro nutrients such as vitamins.
