                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make customer service a better experience for both parties. Arguments often arise during phone calls due to misunderstanding, so we wanted to create an app where voice can be analyzed and a course of action is suggested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program is able to record a conversation and display the emotional state of the person speaking. This mobile app allows users, specifically people who are working the customer service department, to understand the caller better. As the customer explains the situation, the sadness, joy, fear, anger, and disgust in his/her voice is calculated and displayed in a graph. After a summary is given from entire conversation and the strongest, emotional tone, language tone, and social tone are given. The user has the ability to see the specific details of what the strongest tone consisted of. Lastly, a course of action is given according to the combination of tones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began building our app using traditional paper prototyping and user research. We then, designed screens, logos, and icons with photoshop. Afterwards, we used keynote to display interactive data to showcase emotion. Lastly, we used Invision to prototype the app. For the backend, we attempted to use IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to help detect communication tones from written text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into was slow wifi, lack of technology and a basic coding knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Were are proud of finishing a prototype in a two person in the demanding situation. We were able to design the user interface and user experience and challenge learning curves in the short amount of time. The mobile application is beautifully designed and capture our mission of helping the customer service field through understanding and listening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of the design process of ideate, research, prototype, and iterate. We learned programs such as principle and developed our skill in photoshop, keynote, sketch, and Invision. We attended the Intro to APIs workshop and learned about http request and how to use them to interact with APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emotionyze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue to work on IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to further develop the detection of communication tones from written text. We are also going to work not the overall User Experience and User Interface to create an effective mobile application
