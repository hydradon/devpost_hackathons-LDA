                    Piview provides an extra eye to those who need it. Our primary goal of this hack was to tackle some key problems of those living with dementia. We wanted to make something that made their lives safer, all the while providing peace of mind and security to the caregiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our research in understanding the needs of dementia patients, we've created an application that counters some of the most overwhelming problems. For example, Piview will keep an eye on someone's kitchen and make sure nobody turns a stove on and leaves the kitchen and forgets about it. Piview will be able to read the situation and understand that someone needs to be notified. In addition, we are able to detect movement at the front door to try and prevent patients from wandering away from their home and forgetting how to get back.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a webcam to read the data, which then uses a Raspberry Pi hosted web server to connect to the Google Cloud to feed a trained Tensor Flow model and output a response and action that we want.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of us have never used any kind of image detection software before so we really got our feet wet in a very very useful tool in computer science.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Got a working demo, ice skated without falling, and made a ton of friends.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Tensor Flow, something we've barely touched before this weekend.

                    We want to expand this to leaving children alone and other use cases
