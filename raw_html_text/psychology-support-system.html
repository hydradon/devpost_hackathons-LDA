                    Our Software is intended to aid psychiatrists in monitoring their patients. There is a global shortage of Psychiatrists in the world right now
and an ever-growing number of people who need access to mental health care. Our software allows psychiatrists to monitor many patients
through quick surveys sent via text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We make use of the twilio api to monitor patients for any noticeable changes in their general health and wellbeing. We also watch out 
for common signs of depression, sending a text to the psychiatrist when a patient may be experiencing mental stress. Additionally,
all the data from all the reporting patients is stored so that the psychiatrist can track trends of patient well being and general quality
of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instructions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software itself is fairly easy to use. You are greeted by an interface where the psychiatrist enters in their name.
You login to a screen that allows you to add questions to the survey and to add clients to text the survey too. Each patient
can be contacted by inputing their data into the required box, clicking on the name, and then clinking on the send survery option. 
This will then send a personalized survey to their number and results in a "final report".
For Demo/testing purposes, the "final report" message will be sent to the patient so judges can see that a message but it is meant
to only be sent to the Psychiatrist.
                </p>
