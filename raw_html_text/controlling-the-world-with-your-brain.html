                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MUSE reads you brain, and gives you a ton of data given you muscle and your brain activity. What if we make it do things around the world just with a thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Muse raw data is parsed by a node server, which in turns does real time data analysis to try and detect common and simple brain activities. Clenching your jaw, blinking, looking left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating into API's and the use of semaphores in real time data analysis. 
Reading other sorts of brain activity that wasn't EEG was actually hard due to the non-tranquile work environment, but that's ok!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have created algorithms to actually detect accurately when a human (or at least me) looks to the left.  This and many other algorithms are actually based off of a larger algorithm which works on parsing and analysing 'recently occurred data' while the data streams in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to communicate via the OSD protocol
-How to use Muse
-How to read brain waves and brain activity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Controlling the World with your Brain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is making an easy library where you can state the action, and then write code for each of those functions. For example, onLookingUp(callback); which would call the callback if you in fact looked up. It makes the possibilities endless.
