                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been inspired by the great possibilities that the Nexmo API has given us, as well as the idea of making a Server application that can translate language and destroy barriers between people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a client to client chat server application that can translate messages from one language to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with java and divided the project into Client and Server application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the server multi threading was for sure the hardest challenge we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make the server Multi Threaded and you can message not only real numbers but Nexmo virtual ones as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about sockets and APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NexmoChatService
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be great if we manage to extend and improve the GUI as it is lacking good looks at the moment.
