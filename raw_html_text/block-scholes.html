                    Inspiration: We wanted to bring to life the ideas explored in an academic paper
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: We use smart contracts to manage the lifecycle of an option contract for ETH, including custody and distribution of payouts
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We used Solidity to program the smart contracts, Metamask to interact with the Ethereum blockchain &amp; web3.js and react.js for the front-end
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We wanted to create a child contract factory to prevent the parties to an option from having to deploy a contract themselves, as this reduces frictions in the user experience. We also had trouble with web3.js as it is not a well maintained library
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Despite its complexity and the short period available to programme, we were able to get the application to work and the mathematics are financially sound
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We realised that there is a lot of potential in Open Finance applications on Ethereum and that derivatives are likely to play a prominent role in the development of the industry and user adoption
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Block Scholes: We would like to explore this further, expanding to other forms of derivatives such as put options and futures, and have discussions with decentralised exchanges
