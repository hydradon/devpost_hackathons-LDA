                    I wanted to take on Chase's challenge of making a game to introduce young developers to computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game gives you a random string that contains either syntax or a word that one may see in computer science. You have 3 seconds to type that word correctly and gain a point, or it's game over. Typing the word correctly brings up another word that you must type with your timer set back to 3 seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used Bootstrap for the responsiveness and design. CSS for some harder-to-edit values. JavaScript for all the logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When typing a word, the input field would move up and down rapidly. I solved this by adding a class when the field was being filled, but not equal to the string that you are supposed to type. The class keeps the input from moving at all when typing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am very proud about actually finishing a project at a hackathon, let alone by myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about JavaScript and its syntax. I also learned more about DOM manipulation and intervals.
