                <p>
                    Sensors to detect the number of coke in each facing row is detected using ultrasound sensors and stored in the processor attached to the cooler. If any form of networking is detected, the data is sent out from the cooler to the server for processing, analysis, notifications of restocking and for other uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the cooler is being restocked, the expected restocking counts in the cooler are compared to what the restocker is entering. This allows the system to determine the purity of the cooler and adherence to the planography.
                </p>
                <h1>

                <p>
                    It measures the count of products in each facing row every few seconds (configurable time), allowing to capture the sales at very fine granularity. It also measures the purity of the cooler at the time of restocking.

                    Our company builds IoT systems that learn from the IoT data. We would have loved to demonstrate that capability for the cooler. But due to the short timeframe, we could not generate enough data to create a machine learning model on a per cooler basis. 
This project is hosted locally on our laptops for now but can be hosted to a cloud, if needed
