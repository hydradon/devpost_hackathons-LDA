                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A team member has a son with 5 allergies, and it has been difficult to cope with the situation whenever the family wants to go out for dinner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It adds a filter to third parties platforms; helping people with allergies find/ order food/restaurants that fit their needs.

                <p>
                    We used sketch to design a prototype it.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we changed the product quite a bit, Having everyone to be in the same page was a bit challenging.
                    <br>
                    finding motives for restaurants to care about the issue
