                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our interests, outside of studies, is linguistics &amp; learning languages. When learning a new language, one typically has to deal with the repetitive &amp; often tedious nature of memorizing vocabulary. While grammar comes easy, as it can be broken down into a coherent hierarchy of rules in the form of morphemes (the piecing together of particular words) and syntax (the structure of sentences &amp; word placement), vocabulary typically doesn't: these are just words you need to know that usually have some kind of 1-to-1 correspondence to words in your native language. Memorization doesn't always stick well with different people, because everyone learns differently. Utilizing the fact that immersion results in a deeper learning, we wanted to create a virtual environment that encompasses visual &amp; audio cues to help deepen the understanding of the word. In theory, this would reduce the dependence on memorization as a technique, and thus decrease the amount of time spent trying to learn any particular new word.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A flashcard appears on the screen, accompanied by a visual representation of the word as well as an associated audio clip.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used A-frame react to create the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience with A-frame, as well as using it on top of react.js; learning two frameworks was pretty intense. One of our team members (jldohmann) had no experience with javascript, HTML or any frontend developlment before this project. Rerouting REST requests thru a GET request also proved to be difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, although we could see the environment, we could not interact with it. This is because there is no way to interact besides with a user's visual gaze. Unfortunately, we could not look into this problem in greater depth because we could not figure out where exactly it was coming from.

                <p>
                    Learning react.js! And working with VR successfully/de-mystifying the technology as a whole.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of things that would be best summarized as list:

                    {react.js,
A-frame,
serverless webtasks,
HTML,
advanced git}

                    What's next for LearningSpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next immediate step for LearningSpace is polishing it into a publishable application. For future directions, we would like to incorporate machine learning elements into the app that would generate visual &amp; audio cues automatically when trained on a particular flashcard set.
