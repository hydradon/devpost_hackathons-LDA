                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all stressed out due to work, school or other things in our lives. Especially for people who are working remotely, the social interaction that helps them to reduce this stress goes away. I have realized sometimes even a funny robot talking to you can be uplifting so I made a sarcastic bot that checks on the 7 things you need to be doing every morning when you wake up based on most of the remote worker's experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app starts with an intro message to set you up. The tone shows how sarcastic the whole experience is going to be, therefore if you have ego issues, this skill is not for you. It then goes onto ask a number of yes or no questions. Each answer you give leads you to a different response and those responses are also randomized. What that means is every time you run the app, you'll come across a different tone, a different response.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I have used some open-source tools.

                <p>
                    The main challenge was to get so many different combinations and getting the user feedback to be used to in the next sessions.
