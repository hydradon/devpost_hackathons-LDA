                    As a group of aspiring polyglots, we discovered that we were all frustrated by the lack of translation tools from speech to speech, especially from English to other languages; the closest we seemed to find were captions on Youtube videos either written by fans or auto-generated into English.  As a result, we decided to create this tool in the hopes of lowering the hurdle for people who want to learn from videos in a foreign language with a language they themselves are familiar with.

                    Can take in a video in a certain language and output that same video dubbed in another language of the user&rsquo;s choice.

                    Because this is our first hackathon and we haven&rsquo;t really pursued side projects before, we expect that our general inexperience will catch up to us and that we might struggle with locating resources when we&rsquo;re stuck.  In the same vein, we probably will do a lot of trial and error and have trouble finding the most efficient solutions.
