                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have seen different ad boards that have nothing to do with us or the same ads are repeating all the time. On the internet, we have directed ads to the potential customers. From now on, Street ads can have a higher value with the potential customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Display the Ads based on the interest of the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, the users have to register their devices through their mobile applications. These information will be stored on the databases on the cloud. Beside the advertisement board, the Raspberry Pi will communicate with database to retrieve information and display the ads based on the location of the users.

                <p>
                    We would need to scale up the software so It can accept Authentication using social media, add a function to major the distance or the user and the device, Accept many users to be close to the screen, Let the software choose the ads ... etc
