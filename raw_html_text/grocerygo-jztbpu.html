                    A quick item pickup does not become quick anymore when there is 1 cashier and 5 people waiting to get checked out. The self checkout kiosks are mostly out of service, does not register my item properly, does not understand on-sale items, and may or may not glitch out and require an associate to clear the error. Convenience shopping should also have a convenience checkout.

                    This app is an improvement upon the idea of self checkout through improved accuracy of items and costing. It takes an image and passes it through a model which can identify different products and help populate the checkout list. This app also has other features that developed from e-commerce such as creative discounts, coupon strategies, and data base generation for data mining.
