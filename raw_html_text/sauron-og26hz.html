                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, nothing goes unnoticed in the eye of Sauron. Our project is somewhat related in the sense we provide a third eye to the public. With a lot of traffic violations happening every day and lawbreakers going unnoticed. So why not give power to the people and let them contribute to the greater good of society. Let everyone contribute and be responsible for giving back to society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has an IOS mobile app which allows the users to report the violations by recording the footage or taking a snap at the time of the violation. The user can signup for the app or can sign in as a guest user. On log-in, we show the users the total number of points he scored on the app along with his history of reports. 
The next part is a Web application which is built for the admin/authorities to review the tickets an then reward each user with certain points. This points can be linked with a dollar value to the reportee for helping the authorities and help maintain a safe environment for everyone. The web application has a dashboard to show the admin about the number of tickets filed and the number of actual violations i.e the approved tickets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IOS app uses Swift4, The Web is written in Node Angular-6. And the backend's stack comprises of Redis, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Docker, Docker-Compose, S3, Google App Engine, Google Reverse Geocode APIs, ALPR APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a lot of issues in deployment. Unfortunately, the AWS account was corrupted and we had to move to google app engine at the last hour. Working on new technology stacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be have completed the hackathon project in time and to be competing with other fellow hackers. It feels awesome when you built something from the scratch in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Docker, AngularJS, Google's app engine. We learned how to manage time because it was an ambitious project consisting of a Web application and a mobile app and a Java backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sauron
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to extend our project to be able to extract the license plates from a live video footage. Although it does the same for images at the moment. Getting the license plates and other details of the violations will make it easy for the authorities to take action on lawbreakers.
