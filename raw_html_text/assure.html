                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by asking
                    <em>
                        what is the furthest deduction we can make from a simple set of user data?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Assure
                    </em>
                    looks at your card statement and suggests you how much you should workout today and where should you travel to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built using Angular 2 and backend is built using Azure functions and Cosmo DB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend processes user's transaction data and combines it with Foreign Exchange and location data provided by Visa API in order to calculate (1) how much (and where) you should exercise based upon your spending on fast-food and (2) where should you travel based on your salary date and the currency fluctuations since then.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to analyze the transaction data was surprising straightforward and the main challenge was setting up Azure functions and figuring out how to interact with the Cosmo DB through those functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, there are so many. We're proud of the fact that we were able to learn how to use new technologies such as Azure and Semantic UI, the fact that we were able to persist through the project and deliver a product that exceeds our initial expectations even after half of the original team left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the technical side we learned the basics of Semantic UI and using Azure functions with Cosmo DB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, on the non-technical side of things, we improved our ability to work effectively in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for assure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to build on top of our existing data analysis framework in order to deliver transaction based artificial intelligence solutions that could provide information ranging from entertainment suggestions to relevant location based content ultimately achieving world dominance powered by humble financial transactions.
