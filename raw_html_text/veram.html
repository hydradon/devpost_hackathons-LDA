                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to stop forgery and to find a way to ensure products are authentic when they are sold. In order to do so, our goal was also to prevent big companies from exposing their data to external attacks, so we decided to give this platform a blockchain skeleton.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    <li>
                        It allows big companies (in this specific case, Rolex) to secure through a triple-hashing algorithm a key for the unique authentication of a product, and store it on the blockchain. Our smart-contract allows the company to administrate the data, taking advantage of the cryptographic security of the blockchain. In addition, it allows any user to request the authenticity of a key.

                    How we built it

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used contract-oriented programming and open-source libraries to create the smart-contracts and a dummy blockchain ecosystem. For the front-end, we used ReactJS and ReactNative for the Web and Mobile development of our interfaces.

                    <li>
                        We had the opportunity to experiment the application of a new technology that lacks in terms of community help and resources.

                    <li>
                        We managed to create a product that accomplishes a simple task, in an efficient and intelligent way, in order to provide a public service that could be used to prevent forgery and even theft.

                    <li>
                        We learned to deal with stress and with time pressure. We also learned many aspects of team work and new technologies.

                        We see more improvements with the BlockChain to come along and better features for both customers and clients.
