                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this api is to determine if a good produced in a country is listed under Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor,
based on datasets provided by Department of Labor that contains information on child labor and forced labor worldwide from ILAB&rsquo;s three flagship reports:
                    <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One use case for this API is micro-service in Supply Chain Management during the process of procurement. One can cross check if a good procured from a supplier &amp; manufactured in a certain country is listed in the Department of Labor report. 
If indicated, I expect the company to follow up and ensure that the Supplier is following proper process and no human trafficking or forced labor is involved. Another idea would be blacklist suppliers who do not comply.

The government ratified both ILO Convention 182 and Convention 138 and amended the Child Labor Act to prohibit children under age 18 from working in hazardous occupations and processes. The government also launched the Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labor to more effectively enforce child labor laws and implement the National Child Labor Program. In addition, the government released a new National Plan of Action for Children that implements the National Policy for Children, which includes a focus on child laborers, trafficked children, and other vulnerable children. However, children in India engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor producing garments and quarrying stones. Children also perform dangerous tasks producing bricks. The Child Labor Act&acirc;��s hazardous work prohibitions do not include all occupations in which children work in unsafe and unhealthy environments for long periods of time. Penalties for employing children are insufficient to deter violations, and the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups is not criminally prohibited."
