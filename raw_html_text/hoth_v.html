                    Accomplishments we're proud of

                <p>
                    We learned javascript, html, and CSS. We tried to do everything independently and by ourselves but honestly probably should have asked for help.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement JavaScript and HTML with a little bit of CSS. We also learned how hard it was to learn programming languages on the spot in the course of a half day.
