                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students end up not doing their homework in schools because they do not have a mentor or somebody to assist them do their school work. Our group members Oumar, Adam, and Sidi, are all learning English because we just moved to the United States between 1 and 3 years ago, so we often need more help on our homework than other students. One time, Oumar was doing his math homework and he got stuck on a problem.  He was able to call Sidi and get some help, but they realized that it would be a lot easier to post this kind of question online, so we created AmHelp to inspire other students to get more help on their homework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to be assisted and be more confident about the school work they are doing. This platform allows the user invited other students who are advanced or taking the classes to instantly assist them online, through chat or call.  The user logs into their account, chooses a subject that they need help with, takes a picture of the question or writes it into the text box, then the user submits the question.  Other students from their class help the student who posted through a forum.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was build using HTML and CSS also a bit of JavaScript using Cloud9, an online IDE.  We connected Cloud9 to Github to share our work, as well.  We had to embed code to input the equation editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult embedding equation editor on the website using JavaScript so that students have a space to write their math equations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of the work we did by building the website and because we know that we are helping students to do their homework, which we all have had trouble with in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I really need to keep coding because it will help me speed up the work during Hackathon. We also learned how to embed an equation editor into our page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Am Help!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next is making this website look realistic by building an App that can be useful for school because many students would want to access this site using their phones.  We also need to make the submission and response features functional so that the project starts to work.  We ran out of time to build a full working product, but with more time, we would be able to add submission and chat features.
