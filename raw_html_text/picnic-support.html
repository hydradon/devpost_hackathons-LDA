                <p>
                    We've created several models and 'stacked' the resulting submission files. The tsv-folder contains the tsv's of the individual and stacked models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two of the models were built using the excellent fast.ai-library. A third one uses

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fourth model, which isn't included, was built using Keras.

                <p>
                    We've tried to create an OCR model as well, to take advantage of the text labels on the products, but the results were unsatisfactory.

                    Three submissions were created:

                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        2: The probabilities of the local (non-cloud) models summed together

                    Reproducability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The results can be reproduces by executing the Jupyter Notebooks in order. The ZIP file containing the dataset needs to be placed in the same folder as the notebooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    API keys are needed to reproduce the Custom Vision model's results. These keys can be acquired free of charge. Instructions are provided in the respetive notebook.
