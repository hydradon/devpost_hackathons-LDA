                    people committed suicide during the time of the hackathon.

                    When someone is going to commit suicide, it is the people around him that are more likely to be the angel to save, to give new birth to the poor lost soul.

                    Suibirth detects potential suicide and sends text messages to remind people around him/her. In the meantime, Suibirth is going to make a phone call to the suicide to make him/her give away the terrible thought.

                            Backend
We used the Genome Link API to calculate the probability of committing suicide of each user based on their personality, stored the score in the database. With the implementation of spatial index, we efficient detect highly possible candidates in suicide hot spots, and send text messages and phone calls with Twilio API to these candidates and all the passerby in the areas. All of these are realized in Node.js.

                            Frontend
We built a android application with Java and Android Studio, which support functions like signing up, logging in and updating GPS location information into the server.

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we have was that none of us were actually android developers. So it really took us some effort to look into the docs and developed a Android application in such a short time.

                    <li>
                        Since we are only provided with a basic API of Genomic Link, we are unable to acquire personal genetic info. So the development with more specific API of Genomic Link is the very next step.

                        We can use make use of the smart city data and APIs, to get access to the real-time videos of the areas with detected possible suicides. By analyzing these videos, we may achieve a better calculation of possibility, or even make the 911 call in advance.
