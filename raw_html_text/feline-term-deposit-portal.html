                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You create a smart contract wallet which will store all of the kitties you stick on the wall and allow you to lend into compound, our front-end talks to a smart contract which keeps a list of everyone's contract wallets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built in chooJS and we utilised a JS library called Pixi.JS which is supposed to make it super easy to render images and do funky interactive things. However
                    <strong>
                        it's the first time we used this and we ended up regretting it
                    </strong>
                    . PixiJS had some odd rendering tradeoffs, required a lot of boilerplate, and really doesn't like the images pulled from the cryptokitties API. In hindsight we should have just used HTML Canvas and clobbered it with new data whenever we wanted.
