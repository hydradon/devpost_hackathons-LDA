                    recently brought together more than 600 YouTubers to raise $20 million to plant 20 million trees. Although the campaign was just launched on October 25th, over 12 million dollars have already been raised. In an effort to meet consumer concerns about climate change, we dreamt up

                    . Climate change is a burgeoning issue that is too big for any one person to tackle. We believe that any small amount of change can make a big difference, especially when that small change is being made by thousands of people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is an application that financial institutions can implement to build a better world. It offers consumers a convenient way to contribute to the fight against climate change. While there are many things that someone can do to lessen their impact on the earth, most people don't know where to start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application essentially provides a way for consumers to donate their change from purchases to vetted environmental charities and organizations. This would be an optional feature for users to enable. Here's a detailed overview:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A user would add our application as a feature to their financial application and build their profile. This application 
takes the "change" from purchases made by any accounts the user chooses to link. The change is calculated as 
follows: change amounts below 50 cents will be rounded to 50 cents and amounts about 50 will be rounded to the full 
dollar amount.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="language-nolang"><code> If the user makes a purchase totaling $23.37, they will be asked if they'd like to 
    round this purchase up to $23.50. The change that would be donated to their 
 chosen charities for this purchase would be 13 cents.  
</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To build their profile, the user would first go over the list of available environmental charities and choose which ones 
they are interested in. Next, they will be asked if they'd like to have this as an automatic feature for all purchases or if 
they'd like to manually approve purchases to round up.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Any transactions that the round-up is approved for will be tracked on the app. The monthly accumulation will be 
displayed with the transactions listed underneath. At the end of each month, users will be able to choose what 
percentage of their donation will go to which charity.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All past transaction history will be saved in the app as monthly records.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team's two developers, Allen and Srikar, weighed the merits of creating a web application vs a mobile application and ultimately decided on a mobile app to show how the feature could be built into existing applications. By following video tutorials to teach themselves Swift, they made an interactive demo of the finished project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually had trouble deciding which challenge to focus our efforts on. There were many that appealed to us but ultimately, we narrowed it down to the

                    </strong>
                    challenge. Although we wanted to develop a full-fledged application, we decided a demo was more feasible given the time constraints and learning curve involved.
