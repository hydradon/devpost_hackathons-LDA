                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Star wars movies

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes gyroscopic input from a MPU6050 sensor and then send the data, via an arduino into a c++ application using OpenAL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Angles are taken in from a serial device
                    <code>
                        /dev/USBtty0
                    </code>
                    using the asio library approximately 50 times per second.
The position of the chip is projected onto the surface of a sphere and position and velocity are worked out accordingly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into myriad audio based issues, when i was trying to also involve 3D positions in the model, for example, any issues in the 3D audio vector running away with itself, and causing the output to sound more like an aeroplane or motorcycle

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works, use is fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    small errors in sensor data can be massively magnified over time
                </p>

                <p>
                    Trying to integrate it with a raspberry pi zero into a small form factor to make a light saber (with LED illuminated blade)
