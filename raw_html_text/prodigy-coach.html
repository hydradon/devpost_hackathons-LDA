                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We managed to get an end to end software product functionality along with integrating our solution to Alexa and have a working prototype that is already used by the users since launch and they are loving it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We also finished integrating our basic webpage and explored AWS lambda and AWS Gateway API to expose rest endpoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We also learned how to use serverless for the purpose of pushing code to aws cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -When we deployed our app and launched prodigy coach, we noticed that it would start the quiz but had issues while quitting it. There was some issue with the javascript promises. It took us a while to fix the code but was a great leaning for us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We learnt how to integrate multiple components and run a project with end to end functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We learnt how to divide a big project into small achievable milestones and delegating equal amount of work to reduce duplication or blockers for any person in the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We also learnt how to find "hacks" and workarounds for problems that give us solutions as quickly as possible - we got better at optimizing our work besides our algorithms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adding more intelligence to our unique scenarios like teaching different languages to students.They can learn different languages at ease. Also, we would like to it to ask flash card questions for students who are preparing for GMAT and GRE.
