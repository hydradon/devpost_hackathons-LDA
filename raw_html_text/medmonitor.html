                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It ties an accelerometer on an Arduino with the power and discrete nature of a Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our three members each had a different task:
Setting up the Arduino - Getting the device to poll the sensor and be able to export our data over serial
Setting up the Raspberry Pi - Getting the device to read data from our arduino, as well as process that data to calculate allowed variance, as well as push data to our front-end when necessary.
Tying our data to a visual front-end - Developing a visual front end with Ionic, that puts our data collection and actual notifications on display!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our accelerometer sensor had a bug in its Arduino library package that required recreation, and left us with quite a head scratcher until we figured it wasn't our issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use the Qualcomm Dragonboard, but it didn't recognize the Arduino device under its debian image, and it would not support reading directly from the sensor, so we spent a while trying to figure that out, and instead turned to our Raspberry Pi device for processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heroku service for our database and ionic front end were not talking with each other, but we moved our service to the Pi itself and that is working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used the Qualcomm devices before, and only one of us had experience with a Pi, but we were able to tie all of these devices together with research. 
We have someone on our team who is very new to these devices, and she was able to set up the Arduino device by herself.
It works :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot of C, Python, and device usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedMonitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the package smaller, obviously this device is large even though it is much smaller than a computer or other monitoring systems, but we can work to connect our sensor directly with the Pi instead by writing our own package for it, which would greatly reduce its footprint. If we are able to use the Dragonboard with its Arduino support we could go down that route as well.
