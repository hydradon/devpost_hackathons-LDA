                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the lack of competitions for awesome coders like us! We want to create a platform where coders can compete in their "sport" and battle theirs peers in a coding arena.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates a full game of Texas Hold'em with a very user friendly API allowing easy plug in play for any AI model they can dream of!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core game logic is built in python, we choose python because its the strongest widely known AI language. The display and server was built in HTML/Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our largest challenge was time. If we had more time, we'd have built of vision to the fullest! We didn't waste a minute!
