                    I came into this hackathon for a first-hand experience and not expecting to submit a project for judging, however after attending most of the seminars on Saturday I was motivated to try and accomplish a quick hack. After spending alot of time on the drawing board, and being unable to decide between two ideas, I decided to pursue my location-based search tool further. Having arrived at Trent on Friday after a long bus ride, I was looking for a washroom, however, most buildings were closed. This is what inspired me to work on ZapFind!, an app that finds you the closest location of campus services and resources in the matter of a couple of zaps. There is a lot of potential for growth and with the addition of some new features, this app could, for example,  make it very easy for visually impaired to navigate new surroundings. I learned many things at this hackathon, such as time management and most importantly I got exposure to a different university campus that helps broaden my perspective.
