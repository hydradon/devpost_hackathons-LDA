                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After observing my senile grandma's difficulty with controlling lights and other electronics around the house, we decided to create an application that could utilize new technologies such as the Internet of Things and Machine Learning to assist people with this task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user has the ability to control a certain electronic in their home, such as a light or a fan, from their mobile device, using the Internet of Things. The electronic would power on or off, depending on its current state. The user has complete wireless control over the electronics in their home. Based on the user's daily patterns, the application utilizes Machine Learning to automatically and remotely control the electronics .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wired Arduino to create a controllable button and light breadboard. We programmed the breadboard to connect to pub-nub and an android remote control. This was programmed in both java, and Arduino.  We then used machine learning to learn and recognize patterns over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges included connecting to the computer via bluetooth and reading files. We needed several API's to connect the arduino, server, and phone and transfer information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments we are proud of include receiving information from the Arduino to pub-nub and being able to control a circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know much about programming, and learned how to wire the Arduino, use neural networks, connect to an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT SmartHouse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvements for IoT SmartHouse can be seen in incorporating other sensors and collecting more data on the environment, such as turning on the fan when the temperature is high.
