                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday an enormous number of water bottles are put into bins while still containing water.
Our goal is to incentive investments in a water extraction system for these bottles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CNN can predict if a bottle has water within it from its image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to find ways to minimize resource utilization when determining if a bottle contains
a suitable amount of water to justify extraction. We created a convolutional neural network alongside images manually extracted from Google to complete this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Approximately 100 images were found and manually labeled as either empty or not. These images were re scaled to 224 x 224 for this project.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acquiring data for the project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting an environment setup to do machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we've created a cnn. We achieved an accuracy of ~97% on the training set and ~71% on the validation set. These results were deemed sufficient so we can predict if there is water within a bottle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Water Conservation (State Farm)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major hurdle in any neural network is acquiring data. The data used included situations that a water extraction system would likely face such as crumpled bottles or partially covered bottles. However, it also included situations that likely wouldn&rsquo;t occur in a more controlled environment such as a variety of background colors and other objects within the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CNN designed only works on individual bottles, future models would contain the ability to judge larger batches at once allowing for further resource conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While more work is needed on this topic we feel it presents an opportunity to mitigate water waste and has future applications.
