                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing games is what we've done in the past and is a fun way to write low level code and be concerned with performance while also having fun doing it. That's why we decided to write one for this Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that users can play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C and C++ with OpenGL to write this game. No pre-built engines or frameworks were used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a system takes precision and care, and obviously that care and precision is very hard to achieve in a mere 24 hours. The game was, however, successfully finished and it runs well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're pretty happy with how the game mechanics turned out and how it led to some interesting puzzes; it's very rare to get a clean mechanic on the first try, but we seemed to get lucky!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about project structuring, GitHub, OpenGL, game design, and physics!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jelly Boy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been considering cleaning up the code and making a short game out of Jelly Boy, in which case we'd most likely sell packages of the executable and source code for a small price for those interested in game programming and seeing other approaches to it (for educational purposes).
