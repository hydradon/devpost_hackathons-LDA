                <p>
                    The next step is to make the application more
                    <strong>
                        stable
                    </strong>
                    . Next, we will make an
                    <strong>
                        API
                    </strong>
                    for exchanging data and receiving bonuses from partners. There is still a
                    <strong>
                        lot
                    </strong>
                    of work ahead!
