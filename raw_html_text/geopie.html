                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My experiences as a black software developer in tech and the challenges in being able to find opportunities.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Notifies candidate about tech job openings in a .5 mile radius while traveling in realtime

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the ESRI Javascript API and dojo along with node.js and nexmo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into developing a way to simulate a demo and implementing this demo. The reason is due to it being location based so it required physical movement to demonstrate the notifications that ring into the phone. It is a partial augmented reality application so this made it difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of coming up with an idea and implementing it overnight. We are also extremely that we have completed something that can become a value add to a major issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to remain calm under time crunching pressure. We also learned a lot about new API's that are available.
                </p>
