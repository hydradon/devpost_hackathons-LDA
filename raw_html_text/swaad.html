                    (hindi for 'taste') follows our belief that leftover food just needs a little redsign and it can save a lot of food going to waste.

                    is a simple-to-use, cost-effective application that requires you to take pictures of left-over items like fruits and groceries, and it will use Computer Vision algorithms to identify them and suggest recipes to make from them!

                        Finding and training vision models that work decently enough on food data. Most of the libraries we found turned out to be a dead-end after 2-3 hours of investment. Ultimately, we made use of AWS Rekognition.

                        A common struggle with every application ever - networking! It requires a lot of domain knowledge and sending image files from android to the flask backend can be tricky!

                    Building a fully-functional, useful app in less than 36 hours! Some of the tech stack we had never used before. Some of the errors and technical nitty-gritties set us back from our regular course, but we came through stronger!
We learned a lot of computer vision algorithms, the importance of image compression and how android studio sometimes doesn't work at all :/
Also, the fact that we can now recommend recipes with ingredients mixed and matched in the weirdest combination really entertains us
