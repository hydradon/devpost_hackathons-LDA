                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can't be guaranteed that lower income workers have cell phone or internet access, so Aequitas Tech attempts to share important information with them in a format that they will be guaranteed to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shares relevant data to workers in the form of a time clock so they don't have to go out of their way to get the information they deserve. When am employee clocks in or out, Aequitas Tech will give them a statistic regarding their current situation, such as their hours worked that week compared to the average of all the employees' hours worked that week, or more importantly, if the worker's rights are being infringed upon Aequitas Tech will give a warning to the employee. For example, if their work hours are being manipulated, they will be notified when they clock in and be told that they can go to a lawyer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the cross-platform development of LibGDX and primarily used its UI tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built in Android Studio, so those using Eclipse couldn't run the project on their own computer and ended up having to download Android Studio. The UI elements are powerful, but their documentation is mediocre, so we initially had problems with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a clever solution to inform workers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us were new to Java as a language and even more of us were new to LibGDX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aequitas Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this project were to be continued, we would partner with labor unions to focus the application on larger or more common issues.
