                    <strong>
                        With all the concerns about privacy and musings about what &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; could be discovered from the sounds in one&rsquo;s home, I decided to build a humorous skill that uses a make-believe scenario in which a brother and sister who each possess psychic abilities will share what they can read from the user&rsquo;s mind and the sounds they hear with a little humor throw in!  Ashley's "Secrets" are free, but Eric's "Deeper Thoughts" come with a price! None of their insights reflect Alexa's thoughts or feelings!

                    <strong>
                        The free functionality of the skill provides randomized, humorous, fictitious "Secrets" from Ashley, who shares what she has learned from using her mind reading skills and from being a very good listener. The latest In-Skill Purchasing product, &ldquo;Deeper Thoughts&rdquo;, provides randomized insights into some blunter &ldquo;Deeper Thoughts&rdquo; from her brother, Eric, also a psychic, for a small fee!

                    <strong>
                        I coded the JavaScript files with Dreamweaver and incorporated the APL &amp; ISP functionalities provided from Amazon.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        When I first coded the original skill, it was one of the first in which I used Alexa Presentation Language (APL). This version was my first skill to use In-Skill Purchasing (ISP), so there was that learning curve in addition to refining my APL abilities.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        I also had to create a new premise for the skill to meet one of Amazon&rsquo;s Policies that was either added after the skill was originally certified or wasn&rsquo;t considered at the time of that initial review in April 2019.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Finally, testing my skill on the small round hub on Amazon&rsquo;s Developer Console did not accurately reflect what the Amazon Reviewer was seeing when testing it for certification.  I did not have an Echo Spot, so I was relying on what I was seeing on the Developer Console.  When I submitted it for certification, it would fail because the reviewer was seeing a pink screen on the Spot.  After making changes several times that were unsuccessful, I finally bought a Spot which arrived on November 10th.  While the Amazon reviewers tried to help me isolate the issue within the code, it wasn&rsquo;t until after I set up my new Spot that I made real progress, fixed the problem and Our Little Secret was certified on 11/11/2019.  It is my understanding that Amazon will be looking to determine whether this issue I experienced is due to a problem in the Developer Console testing functionality.
