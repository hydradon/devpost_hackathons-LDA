                    Our Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspriation for this web app is the noticed need for a centralized platform for communication between students when dealing with events around campus. Students continue to use a variety of social media and other forms of messaging to coordination the exchange of tickets for events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What it does
We created this app to allow a student to upload a file of their ticket in which other students will be able to see while browsing through upcoming events. Students can select an event and see all the users that are currently trying to exchange their ticket. We will have a system to keep track of trust worthy users so that when choosing a user to make a request to, they can feel that this will be a trust worthy person. Only students that register and confirm their terpmail will be able to make it through this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a user uploads a file, other users will make a request for this ticket. The user who uploaded the file will be able to see all other users that have made a request and can choose which user will be approved to download the file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Flask framework along with pymongo to connect to our MongoDB, we set up a web app that uses routing, small pieces of front-end request, along with heavy back-end logic in attempt to make this service as secure and smooth as possible.
