                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a robotic hand as a prototype for a larger robot that could replace people in dangerous situations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Leap Motion, we are able to track the changes in a hand and then send it to our robot to mimic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used servos, Arduino, a Leap motion, a lot of wires, breadboards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to not use our MPU6050 as they would take too much time. We also had to get rid of our server to make our design work better. We had to reduce our motors since two of them broke. This was also our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the hand to be hooked up. Learning leap motion in like 2 hours. Learning a lot of new things on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use an Arduino, work together as a team, how to use Leap Motion and much much more!
                </p>

                    What's next for Roboarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly expand to a full human body (if we can get this to work).
