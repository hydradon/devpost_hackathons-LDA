                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college kids who often have late classes and extracurricular activities, we wanted to create an app that reassures our safety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeRoute allows the user to enter their start and end location. The app then tracks the user's location as they walk along the route. If the user deviates from the preset route, the app sends a text message to the user's emergency contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this app using Swift on Xcode. We integrated the Google Maps and Directions APIs. We also integrated the Twilio API for text messaging.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps and Directions API: Creates the route between the user's start and end location. 
Checks if user's current location is in the path of predefined route.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Twilio: Sends a SOS message to the user's emergency contact (if the user has deviated from the path without notifying the app)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DocuSign: Creates a waiver that allows SafeRoute to collect and use the user's emergency contacts' information (In process of integration)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was calculating the route between the user's start and end point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we learned how to use a new API  - Google Maps and Directions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate multiple APIs into one application.
                </p>
