                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the recent increase in popularity of MInecraft, we figured the best way to reach out to people, especially younger kids, is through their own entertainment.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out mod is supposed to add a pollution meter to the Minecraft world, effecting the rate of spawning of animals and plants, as well as making fish poisonous to the player if pollution levels get too high.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Eclipse IDE
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came in with very little previous knowledge on the development of Minecraft mods, and were surprised as to the number of necessary files to keep the mod running. We now know for future hackathons that mod-making is an extensive endeavor.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got an untextured block with our custom name into the game.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minecraft modding takes a lot of time and energy. With this newfound knowledge, we hope to improve our mod-making skills.
