                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We used the following website's code as a template/foundation for our own program. We practiced changing the text, inserting buttons, and adding more components to our design with this website.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site displays a new motivational quote every time it refreshes. The button refreshes the page when clicked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a template and edited various commands, mostly the style and text. We experimented with adding code for the button and edited the various existing commands in order to see how each particular one affected the site's function. We used the variable text command to generate new quotes each time the button is clicked. The button itself simply refreshes the page and the code displays a new quote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, when we would input new parts to the command, it would mess up the format of the entire website. Only some font families would work.Also, remembering the small details of the language, such as finishing the commands, with  would sometimes catch us off guard.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walked into the event without any knowledge of coding whatsoever, so we're proud of the fact that we learned various commands and discovered a lot about coding. A lot of the edits we made to the template code was based on the concepts we learned earlier in the event on codecademy.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of HTML, including text formatting, headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, inserting images, etc., though not every concept we learned was incorporated into the project.

                    What's next for Motivate!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our work will not stop at what we accomplished today. We have a lot of plans for Motivate! that we were not able to complete today, To begin with, we would like to add many more components to our website Every person deserves to be happy and motivated and that is why our plans are to add happy/motivational/inspirational puns, videos, music, and more to our website to provide our audience with the best possible experience possible. Not to mention, we would like to enhance the graphics of our website itself and make it look more sleek and complex, yet still organized. Despite having no experience heading into this event, we have all become very interested in the world of programming and would like to continue to work on and publish our website in the future. Especially as high schoolers, we are all accustomed to the awful event in which one experiences being demotivated and this is something we are aiming to help reduce.
