                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of the three of us go to Oakland University. We thought it would be a great idea to start a web app that allows for students to get together and organize how to study, where to study and things like that
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has user authentication so that someone can log in and post for help in a class, users can answer and organize their schedules with a build in calendar. It alos allows for a student to chat with other students
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used Django python, html, css, javascript, and a chat with scaledrone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    time constraints, building a chat was difficult and copyright problems because we wanted to use the bear from OU
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the entire app! one of our members just started learning html and css and we did a lot of work to get everything up and running
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how powerfull django's template tags are, how to build chat room with authentication and other web related things
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grizz Grind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hopefully we could get funded by ou so that this can be an official app!
                </p>
