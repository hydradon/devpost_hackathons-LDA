                    Our team has come up with an online interactive financial advisor with the support of TD API&rsquo;s as an additional service for TD to better serve the younger generation. With the access to TD API customer data, we would be able to get insights of customer&rsquo;s purchase behavior and with these information, we would be able to offer the customer the access to online investment products recommendations; goal creations with budget breakdown recommendations. With all these  features, the customers would be able to get more understanding with their current financial situation and be more confidence about their current financial situation which perfect matched the TD&rsquo;s brand value.
