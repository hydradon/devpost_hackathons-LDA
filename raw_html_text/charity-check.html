                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think one of the best ways to work toward equality is through charitable donations to worthy causes. But how can one be certain that a charity is reliable? If a charity isn't reliably working towards its mission users may try to spread the word using media like Twitter, but sometimes their critiques aren't heard.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays positivity and subjectivity scores, on scales of 1 to 100, of the last 150 tweets directed toward a charity input by the user.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask to build the backend and HTML/CSS/Javascript to build the frontend. We used proxies to get around the Twitter API's restriction of only looking at tweets from the past two weeks, then used natural language processing to analyze the tweets and give them a rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were originally going to build a Chrome extension but ran into issues with differing behavior among our team's laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making the UI look clean including autocomplete functionality and for analyzing the sentiment of tweets with reasonable accuracy.
                </p>

                    What's next for Charity Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible next steps include displaying top tweets on the page.
