                        During our search to find games to buy on steam, being students entail not having that much money. Being the savvy people that were are, we just experimented buying universal game keys on steam through another country. For example, GTA V in the US is about $60. But however in Russia, when you convert it into Russian Rubles it would only cost us only about $30.

                        First it creates a local web server using Node.js

                    <li>
                        It scrapes the raw HTML data form the steam website whether it be in the US or any other country.

                        Then it retrieves the name of the game and it's price and outputs it to the command prompt.

                    -We built it using Node.js a server side Java Script library.

                    <li>
                        We were originally planning to use client-side code, but that is a violation of security and web developers try to make it as hard as possible to do it that way
-Also, using Node to scrape pages posed a bit of a challenge. In the end, we were able to learn enough to overcome our difficulties

                                Also, Steam's API is very clumsy

                        We found out a way to bypass locall sales which are limited to one region only, which messes up the price of the price of the game
