                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we understand and empathize with the concerns and the next-morning struggles that come with a wild night of partying and drinking. So we created Glass, a mobile app that brings together some of the most important services needed to ensure a safe and responsible drinking experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Glass has four main features: Shot Tracker, Curfew, Day After, and Ride Home.
(1) Shot Tracker: Set how many drinks you are willing to take that night, and throughout the night update how many shots you have taken. The app will notify you if you are close to reaching your drinking limit, so that you don&rsquo;t get too drunk and do anything stupid! 
(2) Curfew: Set a time you want to get home by. If you are not home by that time according to our location tracking system, the app will automatically send a message to an appointed friend.
(3) Day After: Set a time you want to wake up the next morning. No need to even go looking for your other alarm app hidden somewhere else in your phone.
(4) Ride Home: Worried about how you&rsquo;re going to get home safely after a night of drinking? Our fourth and final feature redirects you to different ride apps so that you have several options at your disposal. They are both safe and widely available.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the iOS app via Xcode, using the programming language Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app among just the two of us. As we were a smaller sized team, the obvious challenge was productivity and time management. This challenge allowed us to realize the paramount importance of working together as a single unit and staying focused on the vision. By sticking to these fundamentals, we were able to successfully deliver a product that we take full pride in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with iOS before, but we picked it up pretty quickly and managed to build an app in a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use XCode to build an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glass - An app for responsible drinking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have developed a minimal viable product at this hackathon, we are excited to release the app to a number of early customers and acquire their valuable feedback to make further improvements on the product. We will continue to update and modify this product to encourage a safe and responsible drinking experience for all.
