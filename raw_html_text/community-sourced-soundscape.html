                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new rumble strip was just installed near your house.  An airport was constructed nearby.  A railroad is being built a half-mile from your house.  What do you do when your backyard isn't the quiet place that you chose when you bought the house?  Is your office now subject to a new annoying screech of light rail cars heading down the track?  You want peace and quite and need to make a case to effect change.  This project is the answer to your problem of how to characterize and present your issue in an impactful way.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Create a system that collects and manages the data

                    <li>
                        Socially link you to others who may also be affected by sound polluters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Form a case that can be presented to effect a change, such as adding new sound barriers
