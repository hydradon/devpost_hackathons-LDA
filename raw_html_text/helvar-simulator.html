                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started working on the project, we found out that the number of devices provided by Helvar was very limited. Inspired by this, we decided to build our own virtual test environment that can be used to optimize the number of actual devices needed in testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates a room that contains lights that are controlled through similar API calls as the Helvar Luminaires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main simulation environment was created with Blender and Unity, and the accompanying GUI for demonstration purposes was created with Python scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main issues were translating the CIE color system into RGB values reliably and creating a physically realistic lighting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our great brainstorming process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, networking in python
                </p>

                    What's next for Helvar simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Controlling lights based on users' computer activity, learning from past user settings (already partially implemented), creating simulated sensors
