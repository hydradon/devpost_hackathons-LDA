                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    70% of Cardiac Arrest happens outside of the hospital. The first few minutes are critical to organ function - it is imperative that the patient receives immediate assistance, which can mean the difference between life and death. We believe everyone in the world deserves access to the best CPR education available. Effective CPR can double the chances of survival and preserve vital brain function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We teach CPR in a modern, interactive way. We train people on how to administer CPR by providing conversation geared education on both a messenger and a web application platform. Our application teaches CPR for infants, children, and adults using varied learning tools such as speech, gifs, and language translation in order to be accessible to all as well as to keep users engaged, 
whatever their learning style may be. Within the app, users can leave comments, share the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned, and use the social plugin to spread the message to Facebook's timeline. Our web apps can also show locations of Automated External Defibrillators within the U.S., and there's more to come. With modern Facebook Analytics, Google Analytics, and a user community, we can track the effectiveness of the interventions around the world, and perform analytics on our metrics from the many users our platform quantifying the impact we are having. With the user community, new ideas can be shared, and more lives can be saved.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We carried out research on different methods of conducting CPR and broke it down into 3 different groups: adults, children and infants. We found current applications that exist were very isolated, dry and outdated. We consulted an industry expert,   Trauma Nurse, and Police Officers. We received feedback from them about how vital an application like ours could be for them in the line of duty and how we could further improve Save A Life. We worked with talented developers to create a unique platform to connect individuals through healthcare - you will always remember the person who saved your life, or a family members life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easily accessible in order to reach a wider audience, especially people in underserved communities and in developing countries. People in these regions may have limited access to electronics, and might only own a cellphone. That is why we have decided to develop our application as both a mobile friendly web app and a messenger chat bot. In future versions we plan to make an offline version for more remote areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was integrating the speech to text capability function in the web application, as well as finding innovative ways to teach this information. We spent a lot of time brainstorming ways to combine education with community. Using the power of Facebook and modern web design we built a unique solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our big achievements is delivering our solution on two different platforms that can reach many users. We are very excited about our project and it's potential impact in assisting with saving many lives. We are also proud of how our users can interact with our solution in whatever language they are comfortable with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned preventative training! One of the major lessons we learned through our research was that the rate of survival of people with sudden cardiovascular related emergencies is significantly higher if they are given aid from someone who is well trained. If we can improve preventative training for first responders, we can greatly help save more lives. Another major lesson we learned was that people learn better when the educational experience is more interactive, which is why we implemented our application through voice as well as a chat bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Save A Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add offline capability to our application so that users do not need to be connected to the internet all the time to access this vital information. We are planning for our solution to be used in developing countries to train individuals who do have limited access to the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feature that we plan to implement in our application is utilizing a phone&rsquo;s biosensor to detect life signals. We also want to implement an Augmented Reality feature that allows a user to scan someone who suddenly collapses and then suggest what possible immediate therapy the user can provide to that person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also plan to expand our application to include other scenarios such as strokes and seizures, and to include more useful features that can help Save A Life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you!
