                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the nature of transaction in a system. However there is a steep curve in understanding the security features, and flaws, with bitcoin. There are cases where crypto-exchanges lose billions because of their weak security. Most of these cases, these exchange pass on the loss to their users, causing crypto holders to lost their money. This problem would have been easily solved if the individuals on the network moved their funds off the exchange. However, features like easy balance management, unified addresses, and transaction histories made it easier to stick with exchanges. We intend to provide these conveniences to the user by using the blockchain to store information regarding a user's address, while not being involved in the transaction process. This bookkeeping keeps the convenient features we mentioned earlier without the previously mentioned risks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project (currently) allows easy queries (on a locally hosted website) with their (Etherium) addresses to collect information from the blockchain, and provide information to the user.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this app with a combination of Geth and Go for retrieving information from Etherium's blockchain. Python (mainly flask) and HTML were used to create the front end of this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges in this was learning the skills and languages requiring to access Etherium related technology. Learning Geth and Go, and making sure the related packages and directories were installed properly cut a fair amount of time into the project creation. In addition, quirks about Flask and HTML made it difficult to implement the queried information onto the front end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the details of blockchain, how to build applications around the blockchain, and how to access the distribution network to get access to the main blockchain. Furthermore we've managed to make a lot of progress regarding the back end and front end of the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a TON about cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and the neat features of Etherium. It was eye-opening realizing the potential use cases for Etherium and the ways we could build on top of the system. Our team is super excited about playing around with this new technology and build apps on top of it. Another thing that we learned was that bridging the functionality of the front end and back end functionality can be extremely difficult.

                    What's next for BlockTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More currencies and increased functionality. In addition, we hope to implement better run time implementation, and hashing for account storage.
