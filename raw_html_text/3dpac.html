                    We all came into this with the agreed plan to try and create an original twist on a generally expected puzzle mechanic or game. Then MLH had plenty of virtual reality headsets available, and we were all hyped by the notion of actually entering something you entirely developed and built with software. Unfortunately, we set off only to quickly find that our laptops' graphics cards were all too weak to get the Oculus up and running and ended up implementing the game as a three-dimensional computer game. With three different main initial modes implemented, users can choose from endless, classic, and survival modes. In all modes, a variety of unique enemies attempt to catch the user, reminiscent of classic PacMan ghosts' behavior. Using Unity3D and VisualStudio, we used the available libraries to do everything from providing the basic UI and map elements to describing the constantly adapting paths the ghosts' follow. With little experience, there were many hiccups from simple character control to implementing breadth depth first for finding the shortest available paths. We were unable to get full functionality until early this morning, but it was extremely satisfying and I believe with a little more time and better resources we could implement a virtual reality version with more features and complexity to the game.
