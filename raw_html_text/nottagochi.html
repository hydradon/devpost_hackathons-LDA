                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project came from our enjoyment of an old toy and a desire to advance our skills in both coding and electrical engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Raspberry Pi and a python library called appJar, we created a GUI that closely resembles the old toy Tomagochi, except for our "virtual pet" we use the Octocat from GitHub. You feed it, fight with it, and play with it to help it survive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the python library appJar and then ran it on a handheld device created with the Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we ran into was that the library we used is mainly used for GUI and not so much for game development. And on top of that, that library isn't natively compatible with the Raspberry Pi. We did eventually overcome these challenges and accomplished many of the goals we set out to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the library to work with the Pi was no easy task and it required a lot of skill on the part of those who worked on the software. In addition to that, it took a deep understanding of electrical engineering to put the raspberry pi together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot together, mostly working together as a team. Had it not been for teamwork, we may have never finished our project. We all also learned much about the various realms of STEM required to accomplish our goals. Assistance from mentors at HackYSU was extremely valuable to our experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nottagochi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a peer-to-peer functionality for our project to allow two people to battle their Octocats against eachother and maybe even add a leveling system.
