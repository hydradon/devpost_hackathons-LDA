                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make the app after talking to a marine about the logistical issues that come with cataloging the thousands of weapons that are contained in the various armories in the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows a user to create a new weapon scan and then use their device's camera to automatically capture the serial number on a weapon, which is collected along with all of the other weapons scanned into a CSV that can be sent to an email for viewing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build the app using Android Studio and the Google Cloud Vision API for the image processing part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into challenges literally everywhere because I haven't used Android Studio in a long time. There were no parts of this app that came easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of successfully implementing Google Cloud Vision to read in the serial numbers because, without that part, the app wouldn't work at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about android studio and the gradle build process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Serial Scanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to continue to work on Serial Scanner beyond this weekend to see if I can create an app that can actually make a difference in military logistics.
