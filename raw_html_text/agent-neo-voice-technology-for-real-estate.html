                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since my wife is in Real Estate and I am a Software Engineer, we have always talked about ideas where Technology can help Real Estate Professionals by connecting them with their clients. Amazon Echo and virtual assistants seems like the next paradigm shift in the way people interact with technology. So, we decided to create something for the Real Estate industry. Our goal was not to replace Real Estate agents, but instead use technology to their benefit.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Can Alexa help you buy your next home?
                    </strong>
                    Agent NEO helps you buy a house, request home showings, sell your house or find the value of your house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have an extensive network, consisting of thousands of qualified Real Estate Agents, which Agent NEO can connect you with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few examples of how to use Agent NEO :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, open Agent NEO"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, ask Agent NEO to book a showing"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, tell Agent NEO to find my Home Value"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, tell Agent NEO to find a 5 bedroom house in Dallas"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, ask Agent NEO to sell my house"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Alexa, tell Agent Neo to call my Realtor"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Agents spend thousands of dollars trying to acquire new leads. But the best new business comes from word of mouth referrals from existing clients. With Agent Neo, Real Estate Agents are just a voice command away from their clients and leads for all their existing and future Real Estate needs.

                <p>
                    It took 5 months for us to launch the minimum viable product. The technology stack we used was : C# and asp.net.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The nature of the product we built automatically brings the challenge of not only having to convince Real Estate Agents to get on our network, but also the Home Owners/Buyers to use our platform as well. After approaching 100s of blogs, we got covered on one of the top Real Estate magazines and this attracted several thousand Real Estate agents to our platform. But getting the word out to users (home owners and buyers) and promoting the Alexa skill has been a tough journey.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Building the product from an idea in your head to completion is tough. But an equally important aspect of entrepreneurship is getting the word out and make people aware of your product. You have to sometimes take it slow and "focus on the now", otherwise it can get really overwhelming and burn you out.
