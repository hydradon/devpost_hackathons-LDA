                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mheni wanted a good book recommendation service so he could read more books
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users become a member of the book club, you then get matched with another member and put in a message channel where you can exchange physical addresses to the mail the books.  When you are done, you request a new book and get matched with someone else.  You can send them any book you like, but they do have a profile with preferences and they do get to rank you at the end.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just a standard truffle react box. We knew that this would be too expensive on mainnet, so we experimented with a bridged side chain.  For this project, the 'mainnet' is actually Rinkeby and the 'sidechain' is Ropsten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the bridge to work was difficult.  We use hosted nodes via infura and the Oraclize service to bridge the contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bridged contract and a dapp with some buttons that work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rinkeby is awful, and thinking through the security challlenges of locking Ether on another chain was fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Decentral Booking (the Ethereum Book Club)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can complete it and deploy it so we can further tweak and perfect the side chain idea so other dapps don't need to be stuck on expensive networks
