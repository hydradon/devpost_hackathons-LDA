                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A need for extra features in the Jacobs portal. Helping the community in turn helps us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It adds 4 features. J-alumni, Events, Professors and Forum (Q&amp;A) which do the following respectively:
1.Creates a network of alumni with profiles that include their position at a specific company, email, major which they studied at Jacobs. This network holds the purpose of internship and/or job opportunities at these companies, organized communication between undergrads currently studying &amp; alumni and other networking options.
(Sign up is optional, of course)
2.The Event category holds a list of activities currently being held on campus like weekly club events, parties and other social gatherings. An account is not required to create an event which people can follow and get notifications about. This is done to avoid spam and to organize everything.
3.Professors may check in on the website during their office hours or other activities. This option would be very beneficial for all the students.
4.Students may ask and answer questions for all their problems. Including but not limited to homework q&amp;a with their professors and other students.

                    P.S  The free domain from domain.com somehow didn't get activated so we had to use another domain(not related to the project) from another company.
