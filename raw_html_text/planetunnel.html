                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration from this program initally came from the idea to build an app that just spat out the coordinates of the locations exactly opposite of you on Earth. We thought to take this further, and build a game around it. We then tried to think of what makes games popular, and what keeps people playing them. Well, repeatability is one common factor, so that's the direction we tried to go by making this game a clicker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You spawn with a little sprite holding a shovel, and you click as fast as you can to dig through the earth. You start out on the top crust, and have to dig through layers of dirt, rock, and then magma, and then the whole thing back in reverse as you exit the other side of the Earth. It ends with you breaking ground on the other side, and falling out since gravity has now switched, giving it a nice little humurous ending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a flash game using the game desiging software Stencyl. It's drag-and-drop visual programming language made for easy and quick work.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we faced was the inital start of the game, since we weren't really sure what medium to use to develop the game. We tried messing around with Swift and Xcode, Python and Tkinter, but Stencyl was unparralled in ease of use and fluidity.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the whole team's first Hackathon, and so we were honestly apprehensive that we would even have any sort of finished product to show the Judges. Just getting here, coming up with an idea, and creating a product, albeit simple, is extremely satisfiying, and something we're all going to hold onto forever.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that one day is not a lot of time at all to build something completely new, and that we do not know nearly as much as we think we do! We also learned that there is always going to be someone better than you, someone working harder, and if you don't constantly try and push yourself to your limits, you're going to get left behind.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly we had a ton of fun creating this, and had plans for a lot more features that had to be scrapped due to time constraints. In the future I see us flushing the game out, spending more time on graphics and maybe adding a sort of third-person 3D perspective. Eventually even, maybe we'll develop the game into a full app!
