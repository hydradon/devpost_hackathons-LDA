                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zombies; we wanted people to learn how to triage via playing a game in which they save people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have to find the Golden Star
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and applying new skills abut VR, we were able to create a virtual reality game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a variety of skills we had originally and having to learn new skills. We all learned about VR software. There were also technical issues that may have been able to be avoided. Compatibility between devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the VR software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned C# and practice with Unity and SketchUp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Technica- Shooting Stars
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, the game could be used to teach logistical or critical thinking to real day situations. Keeping the Gold Star, players could learn to save money if every time they cross a black star they lose money. Going back to the zombie idea, players can learn how to react in emergency situations.
