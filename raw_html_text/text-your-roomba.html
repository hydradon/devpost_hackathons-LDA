                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for fun/interesting hacks that we could do with our Roomba, and we decided it may be useful to control the roomba from our phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hack allows users to send text messages containing commands for their Roomba, and receive text messages from the roomba with its status information. Commands include taking a picture with the webcam, receiving sensor data, battery levels, etc, and starting/stopping cleaning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected a raspberry pi's serial pins to the serial port of the Roomba, and we run a flask webserver on the pi to receive commands and send information using the twlio API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard getting a raspberry pi working with a Roomba (voltage issues, figuring out how to get the serial interface on the pi).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the pi hooked up to the Roomba,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the twlio api, and about serial interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text Your Roomba
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we'd like to extend the functionality to include more things like adding other sensors to the roomba, allowing the user to control the movement of the Roomba, and so on.
