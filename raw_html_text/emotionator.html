                    Using a series of links to photos with facial expressions, Emotionator  uses Microsoft Azure' machine learning API to decipher emotions in human faces such as anger, joy and contempt; Emotionator then uses that information to produce a line Graph of data that consists of multiple images . This allowing a user to compare Emotions of a person or a group of people over a certain period of time.There are 8 separate line graphs that displays a unique emotion that changes from each and every photo that is used in Emotionator;

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Using Microsoft's Azure Emotion API, I was able to make calls to it by providing it a link to an Image.
The .org Apache HTTP library was used to send POST and get requests to Microsoft's servers. The response was a JSON String in which I parsed it into Arrays of Strings. I then was able to create a line Graph that consists of data from multiple

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some Java Libraries and their inputs were  not compatible with each others.
It was difficult to convert inputs from one library to another.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used how to use multiple libraries and how to manipulate different formats so that a program can run as efficient as possible. I learned how to use POST and get REQUEST as well as having a deep  understanding  of how JSON works.
I learned how to make a basic GUI application using Swing as well as making a GUI using an external library.
Throughout this project, I learned how to store parts of objects and now I am more confident in breaking up large amounts of data and knowing how to retrieve them to use it in an applicable manor.

                    Now that I have a visual representation of emotions, I am looking to potentially apply tools such as Prediction of future 
using statistical  concepts such as linear regression and Hierarchical Models;
