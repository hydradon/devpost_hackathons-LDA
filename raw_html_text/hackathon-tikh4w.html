                    Our program was inspired by the problems created by modern technology when it comes to interaction with younger generations. Our solution to this problem, was to use technology to allow parents or guardians to effectively monitor their children's computer searches and provide security.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program accomplishes this by:

                    <li>
                        Providing a expansive database of words that are deemed inappropriate for younger users of the device, as well as providing a customization option for parents or guardians to insert their own restricted keywords
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tracking any characters logged by the computer user and saving them to a secured verified location for parents or guardians to view
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing the ability for parents or guardians to create their own secure password for the program

                    <li>
                        Providing a security lock down that disables use of the computer until a proper parent or guardian password is provided
