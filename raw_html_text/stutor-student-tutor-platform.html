                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students are normally afraid to ask for help from teachers, and even still, the information they receive is confusing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects students and student tutors, so students can better understand concepts in school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's DialogFlow conversational AI platform, and Sublime Text Editor for programming a HTML file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The conversational AI is obviously not perfect, so it was difficult to get it to work effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully made a chatbot AI, and embedded it into our webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the intricacies of conversational AI, and how to get it to work efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stutor: Student Tutor Platform
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we will extend it beyond the current functionality, and create a more effect chatbot AI.
