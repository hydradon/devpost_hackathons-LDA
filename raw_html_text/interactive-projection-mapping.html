                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've loved the idea of projection mapping forever, seeing giant buildings pulse and move like they were cg in real life. Iw wanted to try and recreate it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One trip to home depot, one projector, an arduino and a few piezo mics all with some clever software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Software and hardware don't always like to talk to each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly just pulling off a large significant hardware hack without much of a plan coming into this, it is one of the cooler looking things here in my opinion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much everything, Processing was new to me, and kind of the design process with limited time and resources was an interesting challenge
                </p>

                    Gotta make it bigger
