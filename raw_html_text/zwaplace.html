                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came when our relatives where looking for houses to rent. The first one paid twice the broker for tour to find a house without getting the house and the second was conned her family lost 680 USD to a  broker who presented them a fake house owner and they only knew it when they were ready do move to the house they had paid for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zwaplace is an online platform that helps people to find, book, rent, buy places ( rentals, places on sales,Apartments, Hostel and Hotel) in the location of their choice without walking or  paying to much to get or see the place they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zwaplace  is Messenger Chatbot which is built using Node.js, chatfuel and PHP. The information are stored using Mysql Database. The Node.js handles everything that concerns the chatbot and the PHP handles the Web part which helps Property Managers, Brokers and property owners to interact with the systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know anything about VR and React360. We had to learn it from scratch understand how it works and how we could integrate it to our idea. We had also to do a survey to confirm that the solution we want to implement will help and that was tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are glad that we are bringing VR to a great public via a chatbot that is 24/7 to help people find a place they love. It is a great honor to give property management agencies, brokers, property owners, public and student looking for house to rent, buy, book an opportunity of using VR in a real need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only way to know you cannot do it is by trying it out. We didn't know Virtual Reality Technology well but we had to give time and try it out to see if we could get the result that we wanted. As we were working on it the idea became clear and we got more inspirations.
We have learnt a lot about VR technology, React360
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zwaplace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are already working on partnership with Property Management and Completing to built the platform so that we can launch it. There is a lot on development side, marketing side and operation side and since during the hackthon and during this hackthon we were first focused on development to see how it will work. We are also going to build the mobile app so the work is just starting.
