                    Mission Statement and Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streams are really important. They provide essential functions such as drinking water, crop irrigation, recreation, habitat for aquatic ecosystems, and hydroelectric power. 
The world of environmental monitoring, especially in regards to citizen science
monitoring, is fairly labor intensive, time consuming, and often requires
expensive equipment and sensor kits. With Water Watch 2.0, we're looking to
ease the data collection process by creating a customizable solution that is
more accessible than traditional scientific equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WaterWatch 2.0 is able to wirelessly update data to a visual display on a
computer, which reduces the need for constant sensor supervision, data
documentation, and manual data entry. By increasing the ease with which we
understand surrounding stream environments, the better we are able to
understand the complex processes and cycles within our natural ecosystem. For
example, temperature fluctuations can have impacts on dissolved oxygen levels
in the water, which in turn dictates the insects and fish that inhabit the
stream.

                    The server will be up and running searching for the bluetooth device with the correct name. The program will then print out the characteristics that it has found and tell you that it has subscribed for
notifications of updates from the sensors.

                    The Arduino uses bluetooth to report the sensor values. It is programmed to only update values when the
value has changed, and will only check every two seconds. This can be configured in the provided sketch file.
                </p>

                    Future Extensions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additional sensors can be added to the Arduino, such as Dissolved Oxygen, or Flow Rate sensors to be
placed inside the water. Furthermore, the range can be modified by transmitting the data over radio to a router and centralized on a website. It is also possible to monitor many streams at once with many IoT devices and create an aggregated view of all streams in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe this project is a first step for the future of environmental monitoring and citizen science
that will improve reproducibility and cut costs.
