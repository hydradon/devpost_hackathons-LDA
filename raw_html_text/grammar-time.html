                <p>
                    I didn't see any Khan Academy related skills in the skill store, which is a shame because there's so much free content. My kids aren't old enough to use Khan Academy yet, but I hope by the time they are, I hope to provide them with as many learning resources as possible, and this would definitely be a great interface for it!

                <p>
                    Khan Academy's content is pretty vast, so I chose to limit it to the grammar topic only so the skill won't be overwhelmed with options.

                    Although the documentation and code samples I found were pretty good, it wasn't really enough for me to develop the skill as I would have liked. For example, it wasn't clear how to maintain a session state using a display directive without using
                    <code>
                        .listen
                    </code>
                    or
                    <code>
                        shouldEndSession
                    </code>
                    (from Alexa Skills Kit in NodeJS), both of which causing Alexa to go into a listening state, but dims the screen and may suggest the screen isn't supposed to be touched. I should have played around with more Echo Show specific skills, but the some of the ones I tried weren't good, or didn't offer the experience I was trying to create.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Khan Academy API is also not easy to work with out of the box.

                <p>
                    I'm glad I was able to get it up and running. The Alexa Skills Kit was pretty handy for display directives, but some of the code samples were outdated, so there were times I wasn't sure if I was using the library as intented.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Echo Show development is pretty challenging! I still don't know definitively how state management works, or when the session ends when a screen is involved. I tried using state handlers with
                    <code>
                        ElementSelected
                    </code>
                    intents to handle touch events, which had an undesirable cascading effect, i.e. every state handler's
                    <code>
                        ElementSelected
                    </code>
                    intent was triggered. Weird.
