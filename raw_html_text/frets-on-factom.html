                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The barriers to music creation have never been lower.
With newer machine learning models even a novice user can create music without much experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One inspiration was from
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_MIDI" rel="nofollow">
                        Black Midi
                    </a>
                    style remixes.
The black midi style celebrates the creation of music using an emulated instrument that is un-achievable without a computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We speculate that it will not be possible to fingerprint machine learning models using present-day waveform type analysis. Because of this limitation we believe that constructing an open system for publishing this type of "new instrument" can future-proof the industry against unlicensed usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fidget machine uses pre-trained neural network models to capture an artists unique style of play.
Eventually the idea is to extend using a python service that will capture performance and input as training data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think these types of tools will eventually be thought of as a new kind of instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By publishing an index of these models to a public blockchain we can create an open network for discovery and collaboration beyond the confines of today's walled gardens (like Spotify/Facebook etc..)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We played with a bunch of midi software to take stock of what is currently possible. Then we created a static web-app that is capable of interfacing with midi devices. The machine learning library that we made use of is

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sticking with the idea that a target user has little musical experience and equipment, we chose to make a tool that can run in any modern web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then extended the application to support searching and publishing models using the

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we were interested in trying to define new derivative  types of music sub-licenses - but ended up sticking to only what could be made under an open Creative Commons License.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One initial ambition was to use the provided music libraries to train new artist-models, but google magenta only supports training via the python library which is not usable via the browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another item we had to remove from our planning was performance recording. This does seem to be possible but we ran out of time.
