                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piano is a very important and useful instrument for music lovers yet it is very expensive. We want to make piano more accessible so everyone can learn piano and pursue their interests in music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a cardboard piano that uses computer vision to detect and play piano sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled the piano with cardboard pieces and springs to make the experience more immersed. We placed a webcam in front of the keys and it calibrates the keys by detecting the calibration stickers. After capturing the key locations, the pipeline detects key presses and play the corresponding notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have laser cut resources so the assembling of the piano took a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It feels like playing a real piano.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a prototype from scratch is a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement piano tutorials with midi files and led lights so the corresponding light lights up when a key needs to be played. This will be easy even for little kids. We also want to add gesture control and instruments in addition to piano.
