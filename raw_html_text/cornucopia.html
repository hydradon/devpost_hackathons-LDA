                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My roommates, my friends, and I wanted a place where we could collectively store our recipes that we shared with each other. At first we were using an excel spreadsheet that got way too messy, hard to follow, and difficult to enter data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cornucopia is a web app that allows users to create groups and invite other users to join. In these groups you can upload recipes that all of your friends or family in that group can see. It's great for organizing and sharing recipes between friend groups or family members that have different tastes in food
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the MERN stack. So our database that we are using is MongoDB. Our Restful API is express and node and our friend end is built on React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into and overcame various challenges. One of which was inviting different users to join a group with only a link.  We ran into a lot of issues with multi-part form data that slowed us down but we were able to figure it out and get past it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to achieve our MVP in the allotted hacking time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about express and creating a restful api and handling multi-part form data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cornucopia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue to add features such as permissions within groups as well as improve the UI
