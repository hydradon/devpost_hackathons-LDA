                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd really like to be social-media famous, but I don't want to put in the time and effort to get there. What if I could use an algorithm to suggest content? I'd be able to generate tweets that are popular with my followers who can spread my words of wisdom and attract new followers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter data is read into a MongoDB instance. From there, a series of asynchronous and parallelized data processes form intermediate representations and eventually build out data that can be used to create Tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a Flask web app that handles the API that is exposed to consumers of the data. From there, I built a job queue service that handles requests for data asynchronously and in parallel. This includes special handlers for making API requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of debugging jobs running asynchronously was the biggest hurdle to meeting my project timeline. I was able to develop a process where I could make each step repeatable, but in the end I couldn't totally solve more complex operations where I'd need to track two different jobs simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a successful data pipeline that has the potential to handle far larger quantities of data. At this point, I'm limited by the rate at which I can get data out of Twitter instead of the compute time or disk read-write.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start simple, and make data changes repeatable. There's no need to build in more complex options into a system ahead of future perceived slowdowns when the code doesn't run the important bits yet.
                </p>

                    What's next for Oshen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More complex analytics. I'd like to move into sentiment analysis and deeper analysis of the best time of day for my tweet engagement, as well as a scraping utility that looks for new web content that matches suggested material.
