                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change is the at the forefront of the challenges facing humanity today. With such a crucial challenge ahead of us, our team decided to utilize data science to help cities and companies around the world combat this major problem and make an effort to make our future prosperous and environmentally friendly.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team developed a platform for cities to monitor and keep track of their carbon emissions and make an effort to reduce them to create more environmentally friendly cities. This platform allows companies to track their goal for carbon emission and measure their progress of how much they are on track on achieving their goal. The platform allows the companies and cities to get detailed analysis of the areas that are contributing the most towards the carbon emissions and what can be done to effectively reduce them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Python, Matplotlib, Pandas for the data along with bootstrap to create the framework for the platform and using Github to host that website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult at first to use bootstrap template and make changes to it using Wordpress. Our team decided to utilize Github pages to host the bootstrap template as this allowed to make changes to the website in almost realtime.
