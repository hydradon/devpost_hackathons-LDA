                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always had the same issues when trying to get hardware transported to the data center:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the wrong car has been booked
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the car has been booked for next week
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the assistant with the access rights to the car rental platform is on vacation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Let's try to fix that:
                </p>

                <p>
                    EasyKey brings the simplicity of a light switch to business car rental. You need to get to the data center with the replacement for the server that broke down this morning? Grab an easy key, press the button and your rental car is ready to go asap.
There's a fair you need to attend next week and you need the same class of car as always? Just grab an easy key, press it and your van will stand in front of your company in exactly a week time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've 3d printed a custom shell for a wemos d1 mini to also hold a button. That microcontroller connects to an MQTT server that alerts a nodejs script anytime the button is pressed. This script sends an email to mock an order process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to print the shell like 10 times because I was to dumb to properly type in my measured values.
                </p>

                    Mass manufacture it and distribute it to SIXT customers! You can do it!
