                    Ever learned to solve a rubiks cube? Well once you've learned a set of rules, it can be a pretty simple task. But how hard would it be to try and solve the cube when hundreds of people are simultaneously voting with their next move?  Using this project we wanted to see how long it  would take. The project has people in a GroupMe chat all puting in their inputs. The small cube-handling robot we've built manipulates the cube according to all of the players inputs.
