                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that could benefit those that face depression. Incremental steps can make a difference, no matter how small, so we decided to build something that tries to make you even just slightly happier, and then tracks your happiness levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website first displays a random quote about happiness while playing a happy song. After logging in, you are able to select how happy you are on that day and then allows the user to input something they are grateful for. Finally, it displays a line chart which tracks how your happiness levels were over the past 7 days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For front end, we used React js, and for the back end, we used express js as well as mongodb for our database to store all the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With most of us still being relatively new to hackathons as well as only one person having built a website before, there was a huge learning curve that we had to overcome. Additionally, none of us had ever worked in React or Mongodb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our website overall, but also proud of ourselves for trying our best to learn web dev over such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about web dev, including both front end and back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Happy Thought
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't decided if we're going to continue with Happy Thoughts yet. Potentially we could develop it further, but most likely it will just be a hackathon project that taught us web dev.
