                    If you&rsquo;ve been the target of online harassment, one of thing you can do to help is to make a Songbyrd profile. Songbyrd, created by Wellesley College students, aims to outperform harassment sites at their own game. Many websites that aim to spread false information about activists&ndash;or intimidate them into silence&ndash;are only successful because they are very good at search engine optimization (SEO). That means their websites play nicely with Google&rsquo;s algorithms. When someone searches your name, a profile of you that was created by others and is designed to hurt you might be the first thing that shows up.

                    We don&rsquo;t want that. We have created a website that uses the same techniques as harassment websites do to perform well in Google searches.  By creating a profile with us, your story, the way you want to tell it, will show up first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be aware that, if you have not already been targeted by online harassment, creating a Songbyrd profile will identify you as an outspoken, committed activist online. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that &mdash; in fact, we think it&rsquo;s great!  It does mean, however, that any identifying information you put on Songbyrd can be accessed by harassment sites. We want you to be aware of the possible consequences that creating a Songbyrd profile could have, so that you can curate your online presence on your own terms.
