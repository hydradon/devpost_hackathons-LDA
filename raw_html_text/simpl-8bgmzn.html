                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The last thing anyone wants to deal with after suffering an injury is booking appointments with an expensive physical therapist. We want to change the recovery process that patients deal with today, and make it something more timely and cost-effective.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app Simpl takes a live camera feed from a user's device (phone, laptop, etc.) and pulls information about their pose and stance while they do their exercises. Then, Simpl gives feedback on the exercises &mdash; is the user moving too fast, is their elbow extending too far, etc., just like a real physical therapist would. Open it up anytime you have some space to get started with your recovery! Simpl makes PT simple.
