                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by video games, where players can easily track others by their player tags and mini-maps.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app places name tags on people who have volunteered. Using a map and the volunteers' player tags, people can easily find who they are looking for.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS with ARKit and a Node.js backend to do the calculations. We used AWS Rekognition to train and recognize the face of the subject. We then used ARKit to project the player tag on top of the person's head. In addition, we used GPS and Apple Maps to create a map of other users nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with XCode. There were times where unrelated code would inexplicably run, despite having commented everything out. Sometimes, the only real solution was to completely delete the folder and try again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed many features for our app and are proud that it is functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are way too many ?? and !! in Swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for Find My Mentor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the project to have more 3d elements of ARKit.
