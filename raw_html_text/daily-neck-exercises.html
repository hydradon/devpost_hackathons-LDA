                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neck and back pain is a condition that many people complain about today, and if this situation is not taken seriously, there is always the possibility of causing serious health problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the application we have developed, users will be able to do most of the neck exercise movements they need to do daily. Performing these movements daily will both ease the users and reduce their chances of having health problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Spark AR and hours of coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties in understanding the patch editor section of "Spark AR" program. When we tried to write code, we had problems receiving and processing data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have successfully completed the program, as well as to learn how to develop applications in the Spark AR program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that AR applications have great potential and that augmented reality programs can be developed easily thanks to the Spark AR program.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the detection of hand movements, more movements can be added.
