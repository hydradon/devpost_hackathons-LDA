                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to quickly and discretely get out of awkward or dangerous situations with the click of a button. Don't feel like talking to a person that's quickly approaching you? Have a call faked to your phone. Feeling awkward in a quiet room? Have fake notifcations from social media sent to your phone. But what if you're getting robbed, assaulted, or even held hostile? With one button, alert 911 and a trusted point of contact. They will then work together to find where you are via GPS and get you back to saftey.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get messages to be sent from your phone without the user to input any interaction. Took us various hours but we finally got it to work.

                <p>
                    Proud to say we built it from the ground up. No frameworks or pre-written code. All created in HTML, styled in CSS, and programmed in Javascript.
                </p>
