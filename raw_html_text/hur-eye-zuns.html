                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't necessarily have a single idea that we felt compelled to create from the get go. However, we thought about potential ideas for a bit and realized that one space that's been very interesting recently has been the world of cryptocurrencies.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a tweet tracker that currently tracks tweets related to the company Coinbase. While this isn't a fully built out version of what we idealized, you can still edit the keywords in the backend to customize the kinds of tweets that will be streamed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sockets: to render new relevant tweets in real time
React: to display the tweets
Mongo: to store the metadata of tweets 
Express: basic routing for our web app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some difficulties with sockets, and simply we could've used more time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    It works!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a LOT of tweets out there.
