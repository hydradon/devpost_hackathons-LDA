                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While looking through the task paper, it indicated the word "society", and we thought that an important part of keeping society safe is by making crime reports more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What Securitity360 does is combining smaller features into one product including statistics on location safety, emergency mode when we cant make a call, counceling suggestions for peers who are struggling on things like drugs and drinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this Securitity360 by using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. We first gathered information about how people can use this app and how it can benefit them and other people around.  Next, we drew wireframes of different sections and created pages for the wireframes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into were that many apps do similar things and we wanted to make them better. Not a lot of time meant that we had to rush some parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud of the background (particle fields) and the ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make society safer. We learned more about time management and how to work as a team.
                </p>
