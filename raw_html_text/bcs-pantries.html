                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know what it feels like to need financial assistance. When I was in high school, I would go to the food pantry every Friday and pick up supplies. This relieved a lot of stress from me and my family. There have been days when my family has had only $20 to spend on food for the rest of the week.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    BCS Pantries is a site with all the necessary information, such as: location, schedule, important forms, the pantrie's website, etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step was designing the UI, we used wireframe.cc for a quick UI/UX design which took us about 1 hour. After that, we created a prototype using figma to see our website in action.
Finally, using python Django we were able to create a static website that can support dynamic content in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was made of python developers, so writing JavaScript, CSS and some HTML was somewhat of a challenge. To get around the JavaScript obstacle, we used CoffeeScript which can be compiled into JavaScript, and for CSS and HTML we used a template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The figma protoype and wireframe looked really nice, getting these two things done within the first 2-3 hours was a real accomplishment because it meant that we could spend more time on building the actual site. In addition to that, failing quickly helped us get back up on our feet and find a better solution faster.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know now where our true strengths lie and what we need to work on. I (Carlos) learned valuable team leader and PM skills.

                <p>
                    Even if we don't win, we will continue to perfect this and create a functional site for the people that need it the most.
