                <p>
                    Checking the arrival time of your usual Unitrans bus every time you want to take it quickly becomes a tedious nuisance. You need to find your phone, unlock your phone, and go to the Nextbus app or Unitrans website, wait for it to load, and then find the right bus in the list of all arrivals. We have made this process easy and automated with our Alexa Skill
                    <em>
                        Davis Bus
                    </em>
                    - the perfect application to inquire about your bus schedule by using verbal commands.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    This Alexa skill allows users to verbally ask her to list all arrivals or the arrivals of a specific Unitrans bus line.
For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Start Davis bus." Then, "When is the 'O' bus?" or "All lines."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Ask Davis bus for the 'V' line."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Ask Davis bus for all arrivals."
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a Alexa Skill on the Amazon Developer portal with a Node.JS backend running on AWS lambda. The backend queries the Nextbus API for live predictions, parses the XML, and returns the results to Alexa who tells the user about the next arrivals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We tried using a npm package wrapping the Nextbus API, which turned out to be way too slow as it fetched the whole bus network's data every time. We had to mitigate this by querying the raw API endpoint ourselves and write code to extract the data we need from the XML response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's very difficult (perhaps impossible) to run the code locally. Instead, we had to ZIP &amp; upload the code to Lambda every time we fixed a missing parenthesis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The speech recognition seems to be spotty, which may be due to malfunctions with the Alexa simulator echosim.io. For instance, it interprets "When is the 'O' line?" as "When is the 'on' line?", despite a list of slot items we had configured.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AWS docs could be easier to navigate

                        We had issues dividing up the work between 4 people because we found it hard to parallelize the skill development process

                        We plan to add a feature in which users can set up their default bus stop. At the moment, the location of the bus stop is hard coded as the inbound La Rue Rd &amp; Orchard bus stop (the one next to the pavilion!) for demo purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another feature would be the ability to ask for future timetables to e.g. plan your evening or your trip back home (when do I need to leave xyz to get home with the last bus?).
