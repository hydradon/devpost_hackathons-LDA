                    Do you feel safe while driving?
With these words we would like to welcome you to our pitch presentation about the bosch car case.
We developed an UI component which displays the most important information of a car to the driver on an onboard tablet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the onboard tablet, our target is that the driver feels less stressed than before he got into the car.
So we tried to use green colors as a relaxing stimulant and also show the current state of the car.
So this gives the driver a direct impact on how the current state of the car is.
He then knows if the lights are on or not for example or if anything is defect.
So we hope it is possible to prevent a lot of accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wanted to inform the driver about the current fuel state, the weather and the humidity in the car.
For the weather, it is special that we thought that this should be a weatherforecast for the next 2 hours. 
This is also a unique function of our product. 
So the driver knows how the weather will change and if there is rain or snow is coming he can easily adapt to this new situation.
Just in overall the driver should feel safe inside his car.
He can also see the state of the car itself (engine, open doors, people without a seatbelt, and so on).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe it is important to make our roads more safe and with the potential of this product, it will be achieved sooner or later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we were not able to produce a real prototype in the 35h time limit because of major hardware defects and other technical issues which threw us back in time immediately.
