                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to created a user friendly and child fun website which would encourage innovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Website provides games and lessons for elementary and middle school age students to explore software developement and coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html to code and build the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how the target audience would see our games/website and be able to play and still learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functional and well designed website and a game within it. The website is user friendly and should be easy for young kids to navigate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn how to use html and how to link images. We also learned how in depth game coding is and a lot about coding in java in general. We also learned how important it is to think outside the box to meet our clients'/audience's needs.
                </p>

                    What's next for STEM Webpage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to add more games, as well as lessons, tutorials for students to experiment with coding and development without having to download software.
