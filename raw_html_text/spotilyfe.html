                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music can be a fundamental part of any experience whether it be working, exercising, or walking from destination to destination. Studies show that listening to music while performing these tasks can reduce stress and enhance one's recollection of events. So why don't we listen to music more often? Why can't we improve how we remember our surroundings by tailoring our music to what we see? Can we go through the day with our own superhero soundtrack?These were questions our team asked ourselves.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doe Rae Me generates playlists relevant to a users's surroundings. These can be determined by analyzing realtime camera data from a phone as well as the weather conditions of an geolocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses Microsoft Cognitive Service's Computer Vision API to identify characteristics about a users's surroundings. These characteristics are analyzed semantically and classified into music genres. We then use the Spotify API to play music of the specified category to reflect our user's surroundings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the data pipelines of our APIs in a meaningful way was our most difficult task. Specifically, working with the Spotify API was a struggle as it had additional authentication steps requiring a signed in user, which was inconsistent with the flow of our other APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doe Rae Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add specific features allowing users to choose the music of different regions in the world. In this way, we can increase a cultural awareness by changing the musical perspective of our users. We hope that in this way people on opposite sides of the world can gain a mutual understanding of one of the most important cultural components of humanity - music.
