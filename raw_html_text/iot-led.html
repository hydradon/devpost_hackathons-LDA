                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the components available to us we decided an interesting project would be to control the LED lights via the AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses an internet browser to control your IoT LED device color mode.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using AWS sdk, we set up our embedded C device to communicate with the AWS with MQTT protocol. For the construction of the webpage and server, Node.js was used with javascript, css, and html to provide an interactive interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had limited supplies to work with and only one member was able to access the AWS, making it difficult to test certain aspects of the service. We also were not very familiar with most of what we were coding with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn more than expected about what we were working within a limited time than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create a Node.js server and get a device to subscribe to the AWS MQTT protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT LED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LED's are popular in many devices and could mean that they could be implemented in many different projects.
