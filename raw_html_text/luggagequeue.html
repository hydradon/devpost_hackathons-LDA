                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When passengers are making tight connections (&lt; 30 minutes), sometimes the passenger will make the connection while the luggage does not. I have personal experience with this; when I was flying back to college, I had to make an extremely short connection at PDX (when I exited the first flight the connecting flight was halfway through boarding). Because of this, my luggage had to be put on the next flight to my destination and then driven to my dorm. While everything worked out in the end, I kept thinking that there must be a better way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app lists all luggage for a given flight sorted by increasing layover time (the bags with the shortest layovers are at the top). You can also choose different flights to view luggage for. The intended audience is the ground crew at airports so that they can prioritize luggage with short connections in order to prevent luggage from getting left behind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built by modifying the American Airlines Flight Engine API to include data on passengers and bags. This modified API was consumed by a React app stylized with Bootstrap. The finished app was deployed using AWS Amplify and AWS EC2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into were learning Bootstrap and overwriting the styles to fit our use case. Another challenge was modifying the Flight Engine API, because we had to read through and understand the whole code base in order to effectively change it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the way we worked together to complete a fully functioning prototype despite the challenges we faced. We are also proud of the way we were able to integrate the separate parts of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things about Bootstrap, React, and the Flight Engine API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LuggageQueue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing a search tool, better aesthetics, and developing a dedicated app in addition to the web-page.
