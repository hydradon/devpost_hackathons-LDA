                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A recent study showed that over half of shoppers would be willing to forgo shopping entirely in favor of avoiding a long checkout line. The same study found that the checkout experience was rated as more important to customers than store layout, customer service, or frequency of sales. With the increased expansion of online shopping, in order for retail stores to meet with the demands of consumers, it is crucial that stores bring down their checkout time and streamline the overall shopping experience.

                <p>
                    The "Shop til you drop" is an autonomous shopping cart that is designed to follow behind the user while they shop. The cart is able to drive forward and steer while following the close behind the customer and is also equipped with a scanner. While the user drops their item into the basket, the scanner registered the item into our webapp. The user has the ability to add or subtract item in the case of mis-scans. The webapp generates a qr code that contains all the item information and quantities at the end of the user's shopping trip to allow a speedy and hassle-free checkout.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chassis of the cart is built using 80/20 components. The cart uses a four wheel drive system with treads. The drivetrain is powered by twelve 9-Volt batteries and is controlled using and arduino and several relay. The cart uses computer vision to track a tag that is attached to the user and executes maneuver to follow the user while during their shopping trip. The item scanning is done on user's smartphone with our webapp. The smartphone is connected to a RFID scanner that is located inside the cart.
