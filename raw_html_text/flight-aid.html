                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to think of various ways drone delivery could be used to solve problems, and decided to create an app for emergency medicine delivery as there are certainly situations in which someone might not be able to make it to the hospital or pharmacy. Drones could deliver life-saving products like insulin and inhalers.
Building upon that, I don't think many people enjoy having to drive to CVS or Walgreens to pick up a prescription medicine, so the drones could be used for all sorts of pharmaceutical deliveries as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a user-facing web app that allows the user to pick a delivery location and follow the delivery through real-time tracking. The app also provides an ETA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on CherryPy and the styling is done with HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS (jQuery). In terms of APIs, we used Mapbox to set and view location for tracking and ordering. This app was built off of DroneKit's API and drone delivery example, and we used DroneKit's drone simulator to test it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to add SMS notifications that would alert the user when the package had arrived but ran into issues implementing the Twilio API without a server using only jQuery, as most solutions utilized PHP. It was also our first time working with CherryPy, so that was a challenging learning experience in terms of picking up a new framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of figuring out how to calculate ETA given coordinates, learning a lot more Python than I'd previously ever known, and integrating nice styling with the bare bones website. I'm also proud of the photoshopped Pusheen background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with new APIs, since I hadn't had much prior experience using them. I also learned more Python in the context of web development and jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flight Aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really want to figure out how to add notifications so I can flesh out more features of the user-facing app. I would in the future want to build a supplier-facing app that would give the supplier analytics and alarms based on the drone's sensor data.
