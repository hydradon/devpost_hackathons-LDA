                    The purpose of this project was to experiment with APIs and create an interesting project that is fun to work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I added twitter to minecraft.  Users can log into their twitter account [securely] through a specialized link and twitter's backend token system.  Because this system isn't written in Java it was extremely challenging to link accounts between minecraft and twitter.  Users can log out and make real tweets from inside the game with simple commands.  I plan to add additional functionality of other customizable in game events being tweeted.

                <p>
                    Although, it may not seem very marketable, it is.  More people play minecraft than any other game, with over 100 million registered accounts world wide.  All of minecraft's developers use twitter to post bug updates, snapshots of the latest game versions, and the extremely large minecraft community has a strong presence on Twitter.  One of the most popular servers, Hypixel, has 30,000 players online during slow hours and up towards 200,000 online together at a time, and is worth an estimated $2,000,000.  There are thousands of servers making profit, thousands of hosting companies who want their server renters to make money, and a small industry built on the game.  Having previously worked for the Official Minecraft Forums, I know small banner ads on popular community sites can generate over $10,000 a month in revenue.  Every tweet my plugin produces also includes the IP address of the server the player is on, thus advertising to the active community.

                    It's true there are a few other programs out there that connect Twitter and Minecraft.  However, they are all mods, and not functioning plugins like mine.  Mods require every single user to manually download, install, and delete game files.  My plugin is a single file dropped into the plugin folder on the server side.

Additional Note, not all the program is on github, only an early version.  Some of the information is sensitive (secret twitter keys) that I have hidden practically, however my example data is my own account information
