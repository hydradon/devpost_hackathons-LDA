                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanting to experiment with twilio, java and python, we tried to think of a useful combination of these techonologies. So we came up with the idea of a parking finder!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android app sends an sms through Twilio to a live website, which, in turn, starts crawling information off the internet with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us knew some Java, some of us knew a bit of Python and wanted to experiment with it, and some of us knew almost nothing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was setting up the Twilio functionality, because we were absolutely new to this technology. We almost quit because we couldn't find the latitude and longitude of an address. Also, the Python crawler wasn't able to gather the information that was generated dinamically, so we had to try several websites, think of multiple ideas... Because in the beginning we actually wanted to do some weird food tinder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we actually have a final working project!!! But also, it is pretty useful and it's quick enough to be used in real life. So the project is live righ now and the world can actually enjoy the free credit we have from Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we learned to use Android Studio, for instance how to connect Javascript to XML, of course, Twilio, how to actually run a Python script on a webpage and that stickers actually make a pretty neat decoration for a laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for parKing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To extend it in other cities of the world and to create the possibility of sending a message with the number of the parking in order to receive directions.
