                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we found out that we were using the Virtual Reality Viewer (VRV) to create an app to better WashU, we were honestly a little unsure of our abilities. Neither of us have ever used Unity or the Google Cardboard SDK, or pretty much anything else required of us to get our project done. Additionally, we didn't have a clear vision of what we wanted the end goal to be. So we got to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started messing around with different APIs and Libraries and we started to see some improvements in our abilities and, with them, confidence that we could produce something that we'd be proud of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After tackling obstacle after obstacle (trust me... there were a few) we accomplished our goal. We created a augmented reality viewer that scans and tracks target images and attaches 3D models to them.

                    App was created in Unity using the Google Cardboard and Qualcomm Vuforia SDKs.
    Cardboard for integration into the STS VRV.
    Vuforia for Augmented Reality applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    App was built and tested using XCode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use app:
    Print out the included images in the folder "target images" to serve as targets for the Vuforia software.
    8.5 x 11 sheets of printer paper work well.
    Load app onto an iphone and assemble STS VRV.
    Start the app and look at one of the target images. The model that appears will depend on the image.
    The app can recognize up to three targets at a time.
                </p>

                    Potential Uses:
    Viewing models in 3D that would be confusing as 2D images (Molecules, Complex Structures, etc.)
    Models could be created and distributed by teachers
    Target images could replace figures in textbooks
    Viewing objects in true AR could be helpful for classes that require 3D modeling and prototyping
    Professors could put target image up on projector, and students would see a giant 3d model
    Models can be dynamic for physics demonstrations or other animated learning examples
    Applications in Architecture, History, Geography, Chemistry, Art History, Physics, and other disciplines
