                <p>
                    An interactive application between patient, nurse and medical administration staff to improve patient satisfaction scores.  Based on the results of the NYP 2013 Press Ganey Survey, we designed an application that will allow patients to submit their feedback in real time so that medical care team could take immediate action and improve the quality of their stay.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Current Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Data from 2013 NYP Press Ganey results showed that 41% of patients scored meals negatively during their stay.
                    <br>
                    Meals: 
Total:  3103 
Positive: 1101 &ndash; 35% 
Negative: 1269 &ndash; 41% 
Mixed: 211 &ndash; 7% 
Neutral: 522 &ndash; 17%
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar results for room temperature, noise level, and direct access to care team were also reported.
These are the types of issues that can easily be addressed with Patient Feedback System, where they can submit the feedback or request with couple of taps and Notify Nurse about it so they can take action on it.
                </p>
