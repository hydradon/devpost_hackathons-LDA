                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to do this because I know that user management is very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, the user is creating, updating and verifying. I'll make it available in production in a much more advanced way ahead
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I wrote mongodb service. then I created an application using the oldest written services and this was revealed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a bit of difficulty configuring mesg.yml
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think this application will be very useful to me and my surroundings. It is especially proud to write a service for the most used mongodb in the world. I will constantly improve for more use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about daaps applications and ethereum while developing it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Application-Users
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future of the application users can log in, check out and bring features like sms and verification. I want people to use this kind of application very quickly when they need it. Maybe in the future I can bring authority and roles management
