                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about a space trip while reading a book, and then I though, why not, let's do one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You command a starship alone in the galaxy, that has to destroy the objectives (stars and so) because that is all you have ever known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to play
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    With a Tobii Eye Tracker:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Eyes to rotate the starship, SPACE or LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to accelerate, RETURN or RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to fire. ESCAPE to exit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Unity3D. I programed all the logic by myself, and the graphical effects such as particle systems are also made by me with the tools Unity provides. The 3D models are borrowed from free assets.
I used a Tobii Eye Tracker as input, because it was an interesting challenge I wanted to run into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing something with an Eye Tracker for the first time was challenging, but it worked nice and it was a very satisfying experience. Also starting and finishing a project all by myself is something one always enjoys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having finished the project and with a result I am very prouf of. I enjoy the look and feel of the game and it is beyond what I thought I could accomplish at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about computer graphics by doing a lot of things by myself, and i've acquired more programming experience. I also learned to use and develop with an Eye Tracker and it was so cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Gaze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to expand the universe. More and different stars and starships, with different abilities and challenges each one. Also writting some story about it all would be very nice, and setting different objectives and goals.
