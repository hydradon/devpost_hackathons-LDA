                <h2>
                    where'd u get that damn good idea from?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from an unlikely source-
                    <strong>
                        MCDONALDS
                    </strong>
                    . While we were sitting there, discussing ideas for this hackathon, we saw the table across from us, full of trash and waste (most of which could be recycled).
                    <strong>
                        IN FACT (look at one of the images) the we ourselves (the participants of this hackathon) didn't recycle our biodegradable plates!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    YO, what is the problem ur tryin' to solve?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    after some digging around we realized how big of a problem this actually is, especially in Singapore! As it turns out
                    <strong>
                        Singapore only recycles &lt;24%
                    </strong>
                    of domestic waste this is VERY LOW compared to the US (35% recycle rate) and Germany (
                    <strong>
                        87% recycle rate
                    </strong>
                    ). We also saw that people SELDOM put the correct material in the correct waste bin. Which
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Cool, what does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using CoreML and Computer Vision, connected to a Wemos Mini Wi-Fi connected board, we have created a simple to use sorting system, combined with an app interface that sorts waste into different bins. Through image classification, we have created a way to identify, and count the amount and type of waste consumed by household. By feeding this information into a database, waste management organizations can optimize the path to only visit full trash bins, thereby saving on fuel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    OMG, How in the world did u make it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the AI, we used a computer vision model and we edited the detection, and added a web request to easily connect to the sorting system &ndash; a simple servo connected to a Wemos Mini board. We built the hardware using just plain old cardboard and glue, making this cheap and easy to use. Using a database hosted on a cloud, the path calculation is a simple app interface that can be accessed by any of the truck drivers available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    But it wasn't all smooth sailing, was it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course not! There were many ups-and downs and challenges that we faced. The most important one being that our team-mate (Sarvasv) who was responsible for building the AI, got sick on Saturday, coming as a major set-back. This is the primary reason why our product is not as polished as we'd hoped, but we believe that the idea is more important than the prototype (for the hackathon)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Hmm, what are u most proud of in this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our AI that allows for the trash detection to be so simple yet effective &ndash; bringing complex sorting machines into everybody&rsquo;s homes. But most of all, we are proud of our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    It must have been a jolly good learning experience right?
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    So watch'ya goona do next with this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we actually see this as a very real product, as it was designed with a very real problem in mind. Each aspect of the design has been thought out such that it can be implemented easily and efficiently into the industry.
