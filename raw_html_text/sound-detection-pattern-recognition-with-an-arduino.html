                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental Illness is a serious issue around the world and to be able to track it is important
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can try to distinguish between laughter and crying
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an arduino that detect certain peaks in speech to try and understand crying and laughter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino is not super capable of detecting those types of frequencies and just can detect sound volume
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first hardware hack!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware can be frustrating but fun!

                    What's next for Sound Detection/Pattern Recognition with an Arduino
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing information of laughter and crying and be able to send a joke or a quote when you are lacking laughter or cry too much.
