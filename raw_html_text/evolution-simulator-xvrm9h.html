                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm sure you've heard of some of these words: machine learning, gradient descent, neural networks, but humans can rarely understand how the computers do it. That's why we wanted to make something similar, but that humans can actually understand. This turned into an evolution simulator with simulated DNA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our evolution simulator simulates evolution as closely as realistically as possible for a bunch of circles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Python using the Pyglet graphics library. Our IDE was Sublime Text and we used Floobits for real-time collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end, there was an error that made it so the children of the creatures couldn't move. We spent about an hour trying to fix this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a DNA programming language that is transpiled to python so it can control the creatures. We also created a program that could automatically generate code for our language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to simultaneously collaborate on the same program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evolution Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue development, iron out a few kinks, and possibly release the source code eventually.
