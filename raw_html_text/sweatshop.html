                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crowd-sourced services have become a huge hit as of late, with the most notable example being Uber. We thought that being able to find a quick and cheap way to get a chore done (such as mowing the lawn) would be useful for both the person posting the task and for users looking to make small cash on the side. In particular, we saw it being useful for suburban areas where young adults are looking for odd jobs to perform to make spending money.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes job postings made by users and saves them into a server. Then, when a user logs on who is looking to perform tasks, they will be given nearby jobs as markers on google maps. They can then select the markers for a quick view of the job, and click them again for an expanded view with a description. Once the job is taken, the posting disappears off of the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app consists of an SQL database with an asp.net API created by our back-end developer. The user postings are stored in the server and reloaded upon a user entering the map screen. When a task is accepted, its marker is removed and when the poster confirms that the task was complete, it is deleted from the server.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the REST API and figuring out how to send object data to it in the form of JSON objects from Android posed a lot of issues to storing tasks and retrieving them.

                <p>
                    Creating a system of server and front-end app that works together was a huge and new undertaking.

                    A lot about Android development and how the back-end works together with the front-end app.
