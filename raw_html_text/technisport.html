                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all are involved in sports so we decided to use our interests to help others find their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can read a step by step instruction on how to kick a soccer ball and how to stop one. We also have a soccer kick demo using Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Arduino to set up our app and demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with getting the buttons to function correctly by opening another activity and implementing a tricky YouTube API system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an accurate demo using Arduino and cardboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on something you're passionate about creates a better environment to learn in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Technisport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand it to more sports and have different skills you can learn with ranging skill levels.
                </p>
