                    When you put people who love
                    <strong>
                        cooking
                    </strong>
                    , the outcome would obviously be something related to cooking. Throw in people who are passionate about
                    <strong>
                        education
                    </strong>
                    and a
                    <strong>
                        HoloLens
                    </strong>
                    , we get
                    <em>
                        HoloChef
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holochef aids people to cook without having to rely on their phone to learn and cook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Holo toolkit to aid us with adding features like
                    <strong>
                        voice commands
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        text to speech
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        onscreen timer
                    </strong>
                    . We also used
                    <strong>
                        vuforia
                    </strong>
                    for pattern recognition so that we could scan pictures for their respective recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vuforia would recognize our patterns at times and sometimes it wouldn't. We did various parts independently, so putting them together was fun but challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You don't need a really nice computer if you have a HoloLens to deploy. ;) :P
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoloChef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more pattern recognitions, more recipe, better UI and lot of fun cooking.
