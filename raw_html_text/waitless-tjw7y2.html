                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of hungry college students, quick access to delicious food is of utmost importance. However, we've all experienced going to restaurants and eventually leaving them because the wait time is too long.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build WaitLess, an app that provides the live wait times of nearby restaurants to help hungry users avoid long lines and find tasty food as quickly as possible. It also provides relevant information (address, phone number, website, price range, rating, and a picture) of displayed restaurants to further help users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WaitLess was created using Java and implemented the Google Places API, Google Maps API, Google Autocomplete, and JSoup. It is a package compiled using Gradle and used custom graphics and XML files for the UI component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty debugging asynchronous network operations and modifying the UI thread from a separate thread. It was also difficult to analyze and scrape the Google webpages to aggregate the live wait times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the UI and being able to implement numerous functions that we envisioned WaitLess having. We are also proud of how well our team worked together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot about Threads and Asynchronous Operations. We learned more about developing mobile apps and about scraping data from the Web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WaitLess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to filter restaurants by category, implement speech detection, and create a recommendation system using a neural network. We hope to collaborate with businesses and to create a community of users who can report more accurate wait times.
