                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by video-games for many aspects of our project, such as the theme of Cooking Mama, the controls of Octodad, and the overall vibe of Wario Ware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the oculus rift, Leap Motion sensor, and unity to make the game. In-game, you attempt to make a soup in a kitchen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware was not working originally, so we spent most of our time troubleshooting it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished a game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use unity and blender.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cooking Is Fun!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more activities for the player to do.
