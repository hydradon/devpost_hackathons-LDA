                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing mathematical formulae is a common task, especially in scientific fields. However, LaTeX &mdash; the de-facto research typesetting tool requires endless lists of commands and hacks to be memorised in order to create the desired effects. Humans can parse simple ASCII expressions, which are far easier to write, but they take longer to read, and look far less elegant. There must be a way to combine the efficiency of simply keyboard actions with the beauty of LaTeX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maths tree accepts input, as if you were writing an expression out in plain-text, and converts it to LaTeX. It also provides an interactive preview of the results of your calculations, doubling as a very handy calculator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The beauty of the modern web. HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 are so nice for prototyping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm to deal with parsing expressions involving operators of different precedence, and formatting them correctly, was a tough nut to crack, especially after being awake for over 26 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The above. Managed to get to the stage I did after scrapping my initial project idea, and cutting my development time in at least half.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing is fun! This has potential!
                </p>

                    A full set of mathematical expressions and forms, selecting multiple commands with the mouse, and even more interactivity!
