                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tractor Supply Company's data seemed like it had some fun patterns, so we thought we'd take a crack at some ML algorithms and data analysis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a forecast of sales, projected onto a Google Maps heatmap based on various categories of goods and a date range
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of web scraping in Python, NLP with spacy.py, stochastic gradient descent with Tensorflow, backend in Node.JS and frontend web development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was limiting at times and didn't get us enough room to create something entirely comprehensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ML algorithms
Designing a full-fledged web app as just two people
Coming up with creative ways to think about the data we were presented with
