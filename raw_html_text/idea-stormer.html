                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted more related ideas for a certain topic google search, particularly animals and science, but also get pictures with them. The website itself is supposed to give the user inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Give related ideas for a topic, using a custom google search, limited to websites with good picture and description matches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Took data from a custom google search, and put it into a website form, using jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    domain.com is not so good, making learning how to upload a website kind of a pain, and also, just was unable to get it working, and had to do it all locally.
Getting data from the custom google search and transferring it to the webpage in a new form took some effort.
We attempted to take data from Microsoft Concept Graph to find related concepts to search and populate our page's concept map, but were unsuccessful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned most of jQuery in a night. Made something that works from jQuery, in the form of a web page, after learning it so rapidly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    jQuery,
web development,
custom google search,
and also domain.com is not so good
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Idea Stormer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we did continue, we would add better searching and better UI/page design.
