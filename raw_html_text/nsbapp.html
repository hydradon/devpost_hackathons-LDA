                        National Science Bowl
                    </a>
                    is a competition for high schoolers and middle schoolers nationwide conducted by the Department of Energy. There are many study sets available for teams to practice. However, when practicing with my team, I realized that it would be easier if we had an app which let us practice individual questions individually, and narrow down questions to  a specific category or difficulty. And this app was born!

                <p>
                    This app uses authentic questions from the National Science Bowl website to help prepare teams for practice, let individuals practice questions of a specific subject or difficulty, and just to let people learn science!

                <p>
                    In Reader Mode, tossups and bonuses will all appear at once. This is ideal for coaches reading questions to different teams during actual rounds at practice or tournaments. The app has a timer feature built-in for both tossups and bonuses.

                    In Game Mode, tossups and bonuses will be read to you as if it&rsquo;s an actual science bowl round. This is good for players who are practicing questions by themselves, as you can select by category or by difficulty.

                        I had to get the questions from the National Science Bowl website. Since they are in PDF format, I used a PDF Parser (pdf2json) to convert PDF to text using a
