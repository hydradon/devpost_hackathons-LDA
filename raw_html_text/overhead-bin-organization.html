                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to HackGT without a single idea as to the sort of project we wanted to do. As newbies, all of the workshops seemed interesting, so we decided that it was ok if we didn't come up with anything as long as we were learning. However, after going to the web development workshops and looking through the sponsor challenges, I remembered how ridiculous it was that my flights home and back to school were each delayed 30 minutes because boarding took longer than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of our system is to make storing your carry-on item more efficient, time and energy-wise. It assigns an overhead bin to you based on your location so your item is more conveniently accessible from start to end of your flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly came up with the logistics behind the system; we have yet to implement it, but it would be a part of the Southwest Airline website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was coming up with an interesting idea to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're definitely proud of the amount we learned about the varying aspects of web development through each of the workshops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to form one coherent website.

                    I guess we'll just have to wait and see!
