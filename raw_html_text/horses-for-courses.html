                        <p>
                            Define the problem you are seeking to solve.
The number of mosquitoes present on the Callaghan campus of the University of Newcastle.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Describe your big idea (what is the vision?).
We will implement a livestock barrier to attract mosquitoes from around the area. The livestock barrier will be fitted with a small number of carbon dioxide traps. The livestock barrier will contain a floral area to lure mosquitoes, increasing the amount of predator insects, while adding deterrent plants around the areas of the university populated by people.

Refer to pictures attached.

                            What is the core foundation of your research or solution (this could be technology,
research, know-how etc)?**
To utilize preexisting techniques in combination with each other. To attack the issue from multiple directions simultaneously breaking down the complexity of the issue.

                            Describe who you think your end-user and/or paying customer could be.
University of Newcastle is the main beneficiary, through the elimination of the mosquito threat while building on new and existing industry partners. The benefit is potentially both a financial one, as well as a reputation boost.
                        </p>

                            Describe your Technology Readiness Level or Research Literature Level.
We are currently at an idea level, less than 24 hours into the idea, but the simple nature of the proposal speeds up idea development.

                        <p>
                            Describe the top three critical hypothesis you want to explore, including: 
Hypothesis 1: A trap that lures and kills mosquito, using carbon dioxide in a closed container with an easy entry and near impossible exit.
Hypothesis 2: Large animals will produce enough CO2 and scent to lure mosquitoes to a controlled area.
Hypothesis 3: Use of certain plant life will encourage them to stay in the controlled area, and other plant species will discourage them from the people populated areas.
o How you will test them;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Testing frequency of mosquitoes in a functional CO2 trap compared to a non-functional CO2 trap in both the controlled and active area of livestock.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Testing frequency of mosquitoes in a controlled area compared to one with livestock.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Testing frequency of mosquitoes with one species of introduced plant compared to another species of introduced plant compared to the control plant species.
o Describe your experimental plan, including any new technologies or tools to be
developed; and
1.We will need to build multiple prototypes of the CO2 trap.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Bring in large animals.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Bring in plant species.
o If your experiment/s in the testing phase are successful what are the next
steps?
Expand operation to a larger scale maximizing benefit while reducing cost.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Describe how would use funding to progress your hypotheses, including:
o How will the work described be performed within the budget (up to AU$5,000)
and time period (6 months) allocated for the testing phase (resources,
capability etc)? 
Sourcing a single large animal to act as a lure, coupled with prototypes and materials for the carbon dioxide trap would take roughly a couple of months with initial hypothesis testing occurring immediately after.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    o What essential outcomes will you generate during your testing phase? 
It will allow us to gauge performance insights such as, the volume of mosquitoes attracted and deterred using the methods above compared to the controls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    o Include a brief breakdown of allowable costs.
We will require a minimum of $3000 to undertake the initial testing phase of this research.
Resources required will be a large animal, a CO2 source (dry ice), trap components, animal housing and feed, mosquito netting, horticultural tools, plants, and minimal labour.
