                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MenateeMe is a website dedicated to finding mentors and professional contacts for women in STEM. After my fellow ladies in STEM raised the issue of not having female role models to ask for advice, I created this website to create connections for these women, aiming to suggest mentors based on a variety of factors such as career aspirations, personality traits, and location. This website also serves to connect professionals who want to provide one-on-one mentoring with a student in their field - another issue that I see universities unable to support.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MenateeMe shows profiles for mentors and mentees - They include names, pictures, and career interest/aspirations.  I aimed to add a tag system so that users could find a mentor/mentee that matches their preferences. From there, they can click on the link to that person's LinkedIn profile and connect on there.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an html/css template and added in profiles with links to LinkedIn profiles. Then I attempted to add tags which would lead to pages that sort profiles by that tag.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried using xml files to sort my tags, as well as LinkedIn API to gather the data, but ran into difficulties trying to load the data. I ended up having to manually input all my information onto my pages. I also had trouble connecting my domain to my github pages.

                <p>
                    I learned how to implement domains and link my actual site to my domain - it took a lot longer than I expected! I'm also learning how to use JavaScript to read in data and display it.

                <p>
                    I aim to eventually use LinkedIn API to read in the user info and make the data reading more efficient, but I wanted to focus on the tags and data reading correctly first. I'm also going to create individual profile pages with more info about the mentor/mentee before linking directly to the LinkedIn from there. The extra info would include location, hobbies, and personality traits.. In addition, for those who want to join the site, I'd like to implement an account and profile creation system and eventually move all communications on the site to be on the site itself, without relying on LinkedIn chat as the main form of communication.
