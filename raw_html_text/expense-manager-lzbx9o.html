                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration is the amount of money people waste on random things everyday and dont even keep a track of it. I want everybody to have a track of the money they spend on a day to day basis and manage their expenses better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can tell this app your daily expenses and whenever you want to know how much did you spent on a certain day or on a certain thing you can ask the app for that particular expenditure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to create VUI and to add and retrieve data from Amazon dynamo-db.
I have divided the app development in multiple milestones:
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                    Finished:
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Add expenses
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Track expense done on a particular day
Post Launch:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give users a weekly and monthly report
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let the user know about the highest things that they are spending on
Future scope:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide users with coupons and discounts to help them save money

                    <li>
                        I had zero knowledge about Amazon dynamo-db and had to learn it from scratch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I had a huge problem while implementing data retrieval from the database according to the date that the user wants
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Making an app that users can use for years to come and which will make their life better
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will help and motivate teenagers to spend their pocket money wisely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And it will help working class people who don't have time to write down their expenses and track it manually
                    </li>

                        Making skills that are actually useful to the users and which make their life better are tough to develop
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It needs a lot of thought and user research to decide a topic to make a skill
