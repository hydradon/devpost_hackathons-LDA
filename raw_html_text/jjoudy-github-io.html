                    Problem Statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although there can be signs depicting which wastes are recyclable, compostable or trash near disposing areas, many are still not exactly sure which goes where. This leads to some items being wrongly thrown out or misidentified as recyclable, leading to the hindering of current efforts toward a sustainable Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SortIt is a website project built in Javascript, HTML, and CSS that identifies the properties of an object in an image through image recognition AI, and reminds the user where to dispose of their waste (trash, recycle, or compost). We custom trained this image recognition software, hosted by Clarifai, using hundreds of manually tagged and sorted photos in order to support this program. This Hackathon demo uses approximately 500 of these manually sorted images so far in order to support a diverse range of products.
