                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For decades, society has relied upon pnis and strings of characters in order to secure possessions. However, this ideology seems outdated&mdash;what if there were a simpler and more user-friendly way of protecting personal accounts and payment methods?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BioPay serves as an alternative means to ensure that any purchase on a site featuring Braintree&rsquo;s payment system is made by the correct identity associated with that given account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user reads the sentence on the screen and their voice is being compared with the voice on their account via voice recognition software.
The camera will take a picture of the user and we use facial recognition software to compare the phot with what we have on record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use LPC and MFCC to build acoustic model to verify user's acoustic fingerprints. Microsoft Face APIs are used to do face verification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BioPay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BioPay has the potential to be more secure than the current password system, as it is dependent upon one&rsquo;s unique voice and face rather than a string of characters. The streamlined process makes it simpler for the user to verify his or her identity when trying to use Braintree as a payment method. This can be expanded and implemented in many more systems that currently utilize character string passwords.
