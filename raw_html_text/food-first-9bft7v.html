                    What Inspired Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 33% of college students in California suffer from food insecurity. Californians throw away over 6 million tons of food waste each year.  These polar opposite statistics show the potential to alleviate both problems for the common good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application fosters an ecosystem in which businesses can offer food that instead of going to waste, can now be donated to feed individuals suffering from food insecurity.  It is based on using 5g technology to provide real-time data, letting the users who have food insecurity, find places who are donating food.
It is based upon using the geolocation api, so an individual who is walking or driving within a certain radius of business that is donating food, will be pinged and be given information on the type of food available and the quantity the business has.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We built it using reactjs and javascript for the front end. The backend was created using python and flask. The chatbox was built with ibm-watson. Sketch was used to create design mockups.
                </p>
