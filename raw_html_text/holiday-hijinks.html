                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it is December we have been getting into the Christmas spirit and we wanted to create a holiday-themed game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this game, Santa has dropped some of his presents while on his Christmas flight around the world. You control one of his helpers, an elf who must pick up the presents while avoiding the evil snowmen who want to stop him and ruin Christmas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity Game Engine along with C# to create this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use Unity was our first challenge. Since none of us had used it before we had to figure out the basics of how to work with the software as well as the basics of the C# language. We also had trouble sharing the project among our computers with different operating systems at first, but we quickly solved that issue and began working. Another challenge came when we tried to make the snowmen move around on their own. Finally, making the different pages all work together at the press of certain buttons was a problem that took some time to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we are proud of making an entertaining game in 12 hours with our first attempt of making a game with Unity.
We are also proud of making the snowmen move and collide with the elf. We had trouble making the collision between the snowmen and the elf lead to the "end game" page at first. We are especially happy with making the horned snowman follow the elf around because it makes the game harder and more exciting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a basic 2D game using Unity. More specifically, we learned how to make 2D objects move around on the screen, one according to the user pressing arrow keys (elf) and some on their own (snowmen), using C# scripts. We also learned a lot about using triggers with our collisions to make the game move along.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holiday Hijinks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to get the game to display the final score on the last screen, which we would have done today if we had a little more time.
In the future we may add more difficult levels that you can achieve when you collect a certain number of presents on the current level.
We also would like to add a "Naughty and Nice List" (or list of highest and lowest scores) on the end screen for bragging rights.
                </p>
