                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The launch of FusionFabric.cloud enables developers to leverage APIs to create innovative solutions and applications on top of our core systems. This is specifically valuable for Fusion Mortgagebot products due to the amount of requests for 3rd party integrations in order to increase efficiency during the mortgage loan approval process. With regulatory changes driving system updates and the length of time it takes to implement a single integration, these requests are typically not implemented quickly, making it frustrating for 3rd party vendors and clients alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With FFDC clients can now integrate with 3rd party vendors quicker and easier, but what happens when a 3rd party vendor or client doesn't have the technical resources to fully leverage the APIs available through FFDC?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution facilitates the relationship between 3rd party vendors and clients through a self-serviceable portal where vendors can easily register then build integration solutions tailored to their client&rsquo;s business needs by leveraging Finastra APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a smaller vendor, our portal enables them to receive and manage requests, and return responses to their clients. Whereas larger vendors that already have automated processes can use webhooks to pass requests to their back-end solution where they can process and complete requests then send them back to a system of record, such as Fusion MortgagebotLOS.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud to have developed a solution in our limited timeframe where majority of the functionality was truly built and working rather than mocked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Seeing this idea turn into a true solution would benefit clients and 3rd party vendors by enabling them to integrate more seamlessly. As a facilitator, Finastra has the opportunity to offer an open platform that encourages collaboration.
