                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I accidentally took one more bagel at yesterday's lunch, the volunteer look at me with a face of :) and say "we have a strong limit on 2 bagels per person" -- obviously I don't know that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to return that, but she refused to take it cos I already put my hand on it, which makes sense, so I decide to make this game to apologize in the fanciest manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Left Click To build turret(100 gold each),
-Right click to choose turret to build,
-WASD
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a tower defense game where you need to run around and place turret, the best part is the AI is built with reinforcement learning, so the apparently randomly dumb behaviour is actually latest technology.
So yes, if I say me taking an extra bagel was the result of the latest technology as well, would you believe me?

                <p>
                    With a fabulous team of 1 people, love, friendship, internet, my hand and my poor laptop which crashes on the beta RL library for over 50 times(I made 163 models btw, only 2 of them is barely usable).
