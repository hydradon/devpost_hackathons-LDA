                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met up with the people down at Astucemedia and found their product demo really cool! We knew we wanted to do something with their sports API. We just didn't know what exactly right away. We flew across a flew ideas, but the one idea that we thought hasn't been done before was an application that would help fantasy hockey owners set their lineups. The big dilemma in fantasy is picking which players to bench and which to set in their lineups. Additionally, who to pick up from waivers and who to drop. This app had those people's best interest in mind, hence the name Help My Lineup!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to calculate a player's average fantasy points per game over the course of the past few games, or the entire season. The app would use Astucemedia's sports API to get the latest statistics in the NHL. Since every fantasy league has different scoring for different scoring categories (e.g. goals, hits, wins), the app is personalized to the user's scoring in his/her fantasy league. It would be universal, whether you play on Yahoo, NHL.com, or any other league.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can enter their fantasy players into the app and get stats on which player has been playing the best hockey over the past 5 games. Hence, it becomes a lot more evident who's hot and who's cold. Who should be dropped, or who should be picked up.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built in Android Studios. Therefore a mix of XML and Java. Astucemedia's API provided the statistics from which we have based our results on.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use Android Studio!!! Needless to say, there's a learning curve to it! Eventually, things got sorted out with time, sometimes too much time. Nevertheless, it was still a very education experience. Other challenges included how to query requests to the API. The biggest and greatest failure during the past 24 hours has been trying to figure out how to use a listview in Android Studios, and scrapping the entire thing after 2 hours of work. Maybe it'll be a future addition to the app!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an app in 24 hours in my first try! Sure it isn't the prettiest and the most functional, but we never expected it to be. Given more time, and more sleep, we for sure could've looked up more tutorials and videos. But we are extremely proud of our project in any case!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing SOEN 341 in 24 hours! Ok, maybe not the entire class but going through the software development process in 24 hours was a really really cool and educational experience. In a way, it forces you to learn something or else you'd go home disappointed and feel like you've wasted your weekend!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Help My Lineup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate all the features and ideas that were cut in order to meet the 24 hour deadline. Revamp the UI, add the "Who's hot" and "Leaders" tabs, compare your team with your weekly opponent's team, include player pictures, include a better player search method, compare team statistics, so much potential! If one day every one in my fantasy league uses the app, then my mission is accomplished!
