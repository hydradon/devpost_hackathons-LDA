                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing smart city infrastructure,  such as   small cells and light poles for creating a rapid response for critical  vehicular  conditions
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project  car sensors  are used to detect a critical condition.   Then   a  send  message is sent to   the road side unit (RSU) located on the light poles, which  activate  a camera action to take  a video/ picture for the targeted location and immediately  send it to a  server (control unit).  Using ML techniques  the situation is evaluated   and in response of that a ambulance drone can be sent  or ambulance.  Vehicles in the area  can  informed using RSU of possible delay or emergency issue.
