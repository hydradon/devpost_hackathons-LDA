                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a specific application utilizing Alexa and the StockX API to help sneakerheads and shoe enthusiasts better connect to their passions. We loved the idea of using what we've learned as a tool to help create a more interactive shopping experience for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our customized Alexa skill is able to give the user StockX's top featured products, provide the user with the most popular item of a particular brand, give prices for top products, and supply a product of a particular brand under a certain price threshold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses the StockX API to connect with Amazon's Alexa through Amazon Web Services and Lambda. We are able to speak commands to Alexa and from there use the StockX API to calculate and determine what best would fit the user's needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As amateurs to rest APIs and Amazon Web Services, we were forced to research through heavy documentation to make sense of integrating the API through lambda into Alexa commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we finally made sense of the web of documentation we parsed through and how we were able to integrate lambda into Alexa despite the countless roadblocks we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about python and the workings of Amazon Web Services and rest APIs. We can definitely see ourselves creating more custom Alexa skills in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hexagon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hexagon is looking to apply the skills we learned at this hackathon to expanding the skills we created and using them in any internship/job we are able to find.
