                    Yup&rsquo;ik is an Eskimo language for which few resources exist. It is an endangered language from western and south-central Alaska with less than 20,000 native speakers left.

                        Yuarcuun
                    </em>
                    means "searching tool" in Yup'ik. We want to build an app that anyone can use as a translator and dictionary, to encourage the language use and development.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to start a machine translation toolkit English&lt;-&gt;Yup'ik we parsed an open-access dictionary and grammar for Yup'ik language. Since this language is polysynthetic and very rule-based, we are writing a parser for the language based on its grammar rules with two aims:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        better results than unsupervised tokenization for the machine translation scheme using deep learning,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        displaying informations in the translation/dictionary tool about root/postbases/endings and their meanings. This feature could be very helpful for language speakers and learners.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We plan to release the toolkit as a phone app Yuarcuun. As a first step we created a dictionary app using our parsed dictionary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python and Tensorflow to leverage cutting-edge deep learning for the machine translation task.
We built the app using React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yup'ik is a low resource language, thus our dataset is not as big as usual machine translation datasets are.
                </p>

                    What's next for Yup'ik Machine Translation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as the toolkit is complete, release it to encourage young native people in Alaska to use and keep learning Yup'ik Eskimo.
