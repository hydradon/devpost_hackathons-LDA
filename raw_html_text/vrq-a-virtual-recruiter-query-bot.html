                    VRQ emphasizes querying efficiency to evaluate the profiles of thousands of applicants at once and creates an easy-to-access database for data retrieval and manipulation.

                    What's Behind the Curtain?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing Amazon Lambda functions with their API Gateway platform, VRQ allows for easy access between the javascript web server and the database JSON files stored into buckets on Amazon's S3 platform. On the back-end, using Selenium with Python allows for quick evaluations of applicants while also sending individualized messages to each person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    VRQ in the Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The VRQ platform was designed with intent for modulation and augmentation. The Amazon Connect platform will advance our product in the future by allowing for user-friendly methods of performing automated messages and emails to currently found applicants. Also, by incorporating Machine Learning algorithms future versions of VRQ will dynamically improve at choosing qualified applicants, performing individualized interviews, and automating Selenium to accurately select relevant data on all web applications.
