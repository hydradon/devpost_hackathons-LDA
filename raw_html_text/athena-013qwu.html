                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a part-time teacher at Berkeley High School, I know the need for easy access to high quality lesson plans. I have seen my co-workers spend an extraordinary amount of money on TeacherPayTeacher for lessons and resources that are not guaranteed to be high quality. This project will impact the education sector by giving affordable access to engaging lessons to all teachers of all subjects. Furthermore, this past summer, I taught math in a rural village in Tanzania and have seen the demand for quality lesson plans in English for the growing amount of international schools. Modern educational technology is targeted at students of rich school districts, ones that can afford technology. However, this product gives teachers access to physical lesson plans and these lessons can help students of all socioeconomic backgrounds.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project we are building is called Athena - an educational technology web application that allows teachers to find high quality lesson plans through an extremely simple user interface. Athena will recruit lesson plans from the top teachers throughout the nation to flood the database. At a price of $35 per school year, teachers will have access to a full year&rsquo;s worth of engaging lesson plans. Each year, 10% more lesson plans will be added. Unlike the competition such as TeacherPayTeacher, Athena is unique in that it is not open source, meaning not any teacher can upload lesson plans. Therefore, the database will not include any low quality lesson plans. Furthermore, each lesson plan will carry statistics on the student demographic that the lesson worked for, thus allowing teachers to find lessons that match their student demographic. Furthermore, instead of having to pay for each lesson individually, teachers will have access to curriculum for an entire year.

                    What's next for Athena
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, we want to gain the funding to flood our database with high quality lesson plans, and then market this product to teachers throughout the nation.
