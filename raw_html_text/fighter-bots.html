                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love building apps to save the world but sometimes its great to just build something that's fun and absolutely ridiculous. So my friend and I decided to take his echo dot and my google home and turn them into trash talking robots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a slightly serious note, the symbolism behind the robot battle was drawn from our experiences with Big Tech companies. Both Google and Amazon are enlargened monopolies that tend to focus more on their egos of being the best and outwitting the other. But that sometimes comes with risk, especially when they forfeit their focus on making themselves stand out and think less about the concerns for the stakeholders they effect. Pride is what we will examine further in this demonstration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First thing I did was make a quick web app in flask that lets people choose a team. If you're team Google you get to add jokes to a list that the google home with use to trash talk the echo dot, and vice versa if you're team Amazon. We also used Arduinos to build robot chases to put them on to actually fight!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask for the webapp
Node for Alexa and Google skills
C for the Arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first servos I used to rotate the wheels were 180 when they needed to be 360. 
Getting the Google Monster to move forward (UPDATE: the weight of its head was impeding most movement)
Running through AWS

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BUILT FROM SCRATCH FROM ROBOTS
Used two different cloud platforms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google NO MATTER what is the best. (Ask Lugo in person for WHY)
                </p>
                <p>
                    These companies do have the capabilities of creating great technology (incorporating Google Home and Amazon Alexa). We were able to instruct the robots to talk to each other for rounds which we've never seen executed before.
