                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from Google Glass. We noticed a lot of fallbacks from the Google Glass so we replicated all the functionality in less than 10% of the price. We made Prime Glass to prove that at a Hackathon -- even though we have barely any hardware available -- we can make something production level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Prime Glass detect when a person blinks. Blinking is the primary way to navigate through the device. By blinking, it switches between different venues and optimizes UX . The Prime Glass has a wide array of functionality ranging from the number of steps you may have taken a day, your heart beat, to something simple like what the weather may be outside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Prime Glass was built from scratch. We believe it's very impressive that we built this from the limited resources available to us. We programmed the functionality in C++ and used  hardware such as:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We barely had any resources, we needed a mirror to allow for holographic display and that took so long to find. Especially since we needed something small to fit in the glasses. Another challenge we ran into was time. This took us a while to complete and we really made sure to fit in as much functionality possible in the glasses for an impressive pitch.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole thing was built from scratch. We barely had any resources given to us. We have functionality that Google Glass has + more. We made the entire thing for less than 10% price of the Google Glass. We also had a new hacker on our team, so it's great to teach people how hackathons really work and what it takes to do well.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hardware is hard....it takes a lot of time especially when you are limited in resources. We would love to talk to MLH about some hardware that would be great to have. Other than that we appreciate the time you've taken to read this far!
