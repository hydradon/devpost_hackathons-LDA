                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all experienced some version of anxiety, depression, stress, or loneliness. Many of us also have friends who experience mental issues for various reasons.
                </p>

                        CONNECTING FOR THE BETTER
                    </strong>
                    Essentially, our website is a hub with advice for people who are going through mental health issues. On certain parts of the website we offer our personal insight into relieving anxiety. We provide links to apps and websites that help people deal with mental health issues. This website is essential for someone can't find solace in just one website or app, or has no idea how to deal with their issues -- we consolidate all the info and add personal touches to it, making our website unique. We also connect those who need help to professionals in certain fields of mental health. We don't have the actual connection to those professionals, so we made a mockup of how the website would actually work. We would work to connect with professionals all over to help people with their mental health.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wix.com to create our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we created a mock up in Brackets of HTML text. We were trying to figure out how to make a private 2 way chat, which epically failed. We also realized that we could not accomplish our other elaborate visions for the website design and elements in one day using our limited knowledge of HTML/CSS/Python/Java. Therefore, we made the conscious decision to use a website builder in order to complete our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make our website visually pleasing and calming for our audience. We're also proud of our elaborate research, and most importantly the fact that we can help people with our idea. We're glad that this idea would be able to help people with mental health illnesses.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to design a website using the Wix website builder, and even though our final product wasn't coded in HTML/CSS, we learned a lot about how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Realm for Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future plans are to develop a live chat between anonymous users and professionals, create a network of highly ranked therapists and doctors, and incorporate more of an interactive and user-friendly experience. We also want to have newsletters and develop specific virtual reality databases for our users to relieve stress. We also could possibly create a membership program so that people could receive therapy from professionals for a reduced price.
