                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I worked at a daycare, we often had exercises for kids to be stimulate learning. Most kids weren&rsquo;t interested in any acitivities they couldn&rsquo;t immediately visualize. I found myself struggling through the same concepts in biology class, where 2d visualizations of 3d organs were often difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a platform for teachers and education providers to be able to easily create interactive augmented reality lectures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to give a sense of interactiveness, and realness to the project was challenging. Animations had to look realistic and appropriate for the models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project has been an amazing learning experience, in UX design. Thinking through different challenges that students and teachers have when learning. Building the immersiveness that could attract the attention of kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how difficult it is to be able to build augmented reality apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AugMentor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably show some kids at the daycare I worked at, once its more polished, and see how engaging the product is.
