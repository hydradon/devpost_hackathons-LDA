                    What Is Tailored?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tailored utilizes classroom environment data and student information in order to analyze the effects of the classroom environment on the student's performance.

                    How does Tailored Work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Neural Network
Tailored utilizes a neural network to generate the classroom environment information - Is the classroom positioned for a lecture, small group discussions, whole class circle discussion, or is it simply empty?  Our image data for this photo recognition portion of Tailored is four years worth of bird's eye view photos from various classrooms at Santa Clara University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Logistic Regression
We combine the predictions that our neural network generates with personal student data to run logistic regression on the correlation between the two factors.  Ultimately our goal is to expose relationships between these two externalities in order to achieve the most effective learning environments for each student.
