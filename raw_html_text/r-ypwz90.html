                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The college life is not easy for anyone. Often students face personal and/or academic issues in their daily lives and they forget to take care of their mental and physical health. This app is motivated by the idea that the college can demonstrate interest in the student struggles and be aware and willing to help her/him.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    REMEMO asks questions related to the student experiences in life as well as opinions of her/his feelings in certain scenarios. After this, the app create a memo with tips for the student. Those tips give the student ideas of what to do when facing stressful situations and/or what to do to balance academic and personal life, for example. This is a creative way to deal with problems, understand them and see that many people pass through the same things.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using just basic variables, such as (print) and (input).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners, we had troubles to initiate the program and develop it. We did a lot of research on Google and asked for help of CS students to explain some possible actions on Python. Another problem that we found is that sometimes some of the user answers are not extremely accurate.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are beginners in coding languages. Our majors are Art and Music, but we are passionate about creating new ideas and help people around the student community. We are proud of building a meaningful game.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project we learned how to use the basic variables of Python and how to work on something under pressure and in group efficiently.
