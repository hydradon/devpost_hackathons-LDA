                <p>
                    My teammate and I know diferents programming lenguages, for this reason we decide to do something that neither of us knew. During the week we discussed about what project we could do, and finally, friday night we decided that we needed something to organize all information about hackathons. Also, this idea allow us to learn about real-time data bases, this was a topic that interested us.
                </p>

                    How I build it

                <p>
                    To work with real-time data update, we decided to use JavaScript Framework
                    <strong>
                        Vue.js
                    </strong>
                    . To do vue.js main and all components we use
                    <strong>
                        HTML
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        CSS
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        JavaScript
                    </strong>
                    . To create different users we thank to use
                    <strong>
                        Firebase Authentication
                    </strong>
                    and to save different item lists we used
                    <strong>
                        FireBase Realtime Database
                    </strong>
                    .

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging thing we have done during this hackathon was to try to do a project using technologies that we rarely use or don't even know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we can't finally our project, we are proud of already submit a project. Created a simple user interface and connect vue.js with firebase. And also learn how to work with vue.js for displaying data from a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of things, HTML, CSS, Java Script, vue.js, Firebase RealTime Database and Firebase Authentication.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to finish the project! And add the possibility to connect multiple users with a same dashboard, also add the organizer user that can give some advices to the hackers like picking different kind of clothes or buy tickets for shipper flights or train tickets.
