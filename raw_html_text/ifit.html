                    We propose to build an android app which allows patients to get appointments online, and even bed
booking in case of emergency online. Thus saving time and precious lives. Since we all know how much
difficult it is to get bed at Hospitals due to increasing cases of medical unfitness in today&rsquo;s era. We also
aim to build a part through which a user can ask for blood through the app itself. The app will send
request to the Blood Bank and all the users with the specified blood group. In this manner, users can get
even the rarest blood group in minimum time. We will provide a section to cure small and common
diseases by using ayurvedic methods. The user can enter the symptoms and the best possible ayurvedic
treatment will be displayed to him.
In short, the app will cover all the major health areas which can surely save people&rsquo;s lives.
