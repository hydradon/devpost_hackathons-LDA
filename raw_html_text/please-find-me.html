                <p>
                    When I came to USA 6 months ago, One day my phone beeped and I saw a missing person alert, Though it was really impressive but it was lacking the most important part &mdash; Image of the missing person !   Back  home in India , everyday I see my friend positing or sharing missing people information , which is hardly of any use ! Since a person has a very limited ability to keep those images in mind , and when they actually see the missing person, they have no idea that they have seen them earlier in any facebook posts !!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used facebook's chabot api to collect information, we have added two functions, one for reporting missing people and another for finding people already in the database. Here we store the images, information in a MongoDB database. We use facial recognition to help understand features at a deep level.

                <p>
                    We have a working chatbot that can find and report people using image search.

                <p>
                    we learned how to create a automated chatbot, learned mongodb, understood that facial recognition can work very well using only  few images.
