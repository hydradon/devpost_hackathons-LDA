                    Do Elevators Dream of Electric Sheep?
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    In a modern society who wants to waste their precious time waiting elevators?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From now on you don't have to. We'll bring elevators to 21th century. Through wave of digitalization in our society people have been able to better make use of their time when everyday tasks have been automated. We are not accustomed to being able to improve our efficiency in such routine tasks like waiting for an elevator. What if most of the time you wouldn't have to wait, but the elevator would be waiting for you?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our early Proof of Concept uses bluetooth radio signal intensity to evaluate if a user is approaching the elevator. In future versions of the solution, in addition to wide spectrum radio detection we would use machine learning algorithms to learn movement patterns through recurring changes in signal levels. Our solution can have self-learning models that need little configuration after initial installation in the elevator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an early PoC. To make sure that the solution is viable in production, we would need to create a live size test environment with proper hardware such as wide spectrum radio receivers and machine learning algorithms to accompany gathered data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solution seems promising. Bringing marginal improvement to people'a everyday life in a product that is used everywhere could have global impact through better efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got initial confirmation that this solution could be viable. During the hackathon we were able to build pieces of hardware and software stack needed to understand some of the challenges that we have to be able to solve going forward.
                </p>

                    What's next for 'Do Elevators Dream of Electric Sheep?'
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together with KONE we would be able to develop our solution further and adjust the machine learning models to create and test out viability and accuracy in live size environment.
