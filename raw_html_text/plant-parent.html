                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of people forget to water it just take care of their plants in general, with Plant Parent you wont have to worry about your plant dying ever again.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plant Parent monitors the water levels in the soil for your plant, and adds water based on those readings. Plant Parent also gives the appropriate amount of lighting for the correct amount of time to make sure your plant grows the best it can!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino board and connect an LCD screen, a few buttons for user input, and a servo motor to pour the water. Coded on Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally tried to do a more complex scroll menu on the LCD screen, but ran out of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to incorporate several sensors and a plant database to operate successfully on most plants people will usually own.
