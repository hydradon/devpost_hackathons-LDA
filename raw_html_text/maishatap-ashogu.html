                <p>
                    One weekend we  had a  boat-riding  event with  couple of friends at Indian ocean.Unfortunately , one of our friends drowned while swimming .It took a minimum to two hours for us to get response from the  nearby health centres of which some did not even show up at all. our colleague's condition continued to  worsen  due to little-know on directions and available health facilities. This took us a long time period of time to access medication. 
Following on the above scenario, had there been simple way that gives an ease access to not only  with directions to health facilities but also with info regarding the nearest open health facilities in case of emergencies, then the response time to medication could be short.
This scenario represents one of the many emergencies that may takes place and a lot of lives are claimed due to delayed response to medication.
We thought of an easy way to solve this problem using technology and we represent to you MaishaTap!
