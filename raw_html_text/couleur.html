                    No life is lived in black and white and colours fulfill their purpose by bring more variety and expression to our lifes. "Don't believe me just watch!" Our name is Couleurs and our vision is to bring people together through colors and provide them experiences that can only be enjoyed in the bar!

                    We would be actively working with the Dataflow Meter to monitor consumption of different kinds of beer in the bar and in turn, use the data to push out dynamic promotions to the general population in the bar through an iOS app.
Additionally, we will be utilizing a smart glass with an LED that has 4 different colors with a certain population within the bar tagged to a color, so that people with the same color can come together to socialize. The bar owner will have the option to push dynamic promotions to a certain population as well.
