                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the need of people to visualize and see how cars are spread and what they can do in order to take their MOT test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts whether a car will pass the mot test or nor and visualizes the total number of cars for each country tested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a machine learning algorithm and an Open Source given by Harvard with a free license for the 
visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The connection between the python and nodejs servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to finish the visualization and the prediction both in the same time and getting past all the problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about RPCs, flask and other back-end technologies plus about what other data visualizations APIs are out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CheckIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to implement an algorithm which will predict when you will have to take your next technical test.
