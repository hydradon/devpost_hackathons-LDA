                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were frustrated by the lack of clear organization among TArget search results; and decided that an algorithm that displayed more relevant results was necessary; similar to how E-commerce competitors display personalized results for each search, and visit to the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product collects a log of all searches that a particular user enters, and also records items that a user clicks on. It uses this data to display a homepage to the user showing them items they may be interested in; as well as create a "trends" page that displays products that are currently trending on Target's website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the site using Microsoft ASP.NET 4.5 MVC, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to make the website look profesional, and at the same time have all of the functionality that we desired. We had to make a trade-off between functionality and good looks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to parse the data from the Target web page, and generate data that is meaningful to the end-user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the importance of thoroughly planning a project in advance; so that we do not have to make drastic changes at the last minute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iDunno
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who knows? It's on GitHub -- maybe Target will choose to implement some of its features on its own website, and the search and product discovery experience for the end user will be much improved.
