                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by a fellow hacker, she used the google API to visualize crime data. My idea was to combine two services to see photos in any location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built with PHP, JavaScript, JSON, HTML/CSS, and Twitter bootstrap.
It works by typing in a location into a search filed then pressing enter, the rest of the work is handled by the code.
                </p>

                        Potential use case
                    </strong>
                    ---Police stations can search locations for recent photo activity, adding search options could enhance this idea.
---Look at photos posted to Instagram in places you may vacation.
---View random image galleries from your old/ future neighborhood.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LOTS, I learned all of these skills within the last 36 hours, I've finished JavaScript training on codecademy and got to 47% in PHP. I was unsure how to setup a local host, how to convert XML to JSON nodes, how to manage my time, and how to get everything working together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really happy that I met so many people who are so similar to me, I accomplished having a good time and building a cool project with newly gained skills. I was unable to get my project to work for about 5 hours straight because I didn't know anything about SSL/ Certificate errors, so I asked around. Finally I was able to figure out my problem and have my project accomplish what I aimed to do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot, most stated above. I 3D printed something for the 1st time, and worked with a lot of web development tools.
                </p>

                    What's next for Geographic Gram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to tidy up the User interface and make it look good, then find a way to have random locations come up, and allow user to only return images with specific #hashtags.
