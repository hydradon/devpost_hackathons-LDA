                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current state of influencers seeking for sponsorship has focused primarily on influencers having to put their personal contact information on a public forum for brands to find and sponsor them. The existing solution fails to address the issue of security, privacy, and legitimizing legal contracts between the brands and the sponsor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This raised significant privacy concerns for the content creators. Fraudulent brands can try to work with online content creators and these creators may not know if the brand or person who contacts them is legitimate. This sets up vulnerable content creators to possibly get scammed with no proper protection for the content creator if the agreement goes wrong or is illegitimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the individuals are at risk for making informal agreements with brands to sponsor content and without a legal team to legitimize the deal and ensure it benefits them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brands must be verified using Ethereum Name Service(ENS) to verify their status to reduce the risks that influencer currently experience with fraudulent brands contacting them. Upon verification, brands can access a list of bounties created by influencers seeking for collaboration and sponsorship. Brands are able to view the influencer's profile in depth and decide if they want to fulfill their bounty by working with them and getting their product sponsored in the influencers' content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the brand clicks to fulfill a bounty, this bounty is submitted on the blockchain for the influencer to then accept. Once accepted then the transaction is put on the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An influencer and brand is able to verify or check the terms of their agreement via this blockchain.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used nodejs for the front end and used the npm package modules ganache and truffle. We used the metamask chrome extension as our blockchain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Metamask started to not work early in the morning on the last day of the hackathon on one of the dev&rsquo;s computers. However it seems to be a bug on metamask as if worked fine on another dev&rsquo;s computer. It seems to be a common problem people face and we wasted a lot of time debugging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also hard setting up the smart contract as there is very little documentation online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the bounty is able to be submitted to the blockchain and an influencer can accept it in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reclone the repo if there are unexplainable bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Probably best to have created the smart contract backend then do the ui, as we did it the other way around.
                </p>
