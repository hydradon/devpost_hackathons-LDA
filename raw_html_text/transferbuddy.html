                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of foreigners leaving in Finland. Having a family about there a need to transfer money regularly abroad. Why not provide them with the best exchange rates, meaning executing payments in the most favourable time. Analysing financial markets is a time-consuming and tedious task, so a personal bot could help with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot uses financial technical analysis like SMA (simple moving average), and (RSI) reference strength index to alert the user on a good time to execute a payment based on the frequency set during the configuration. For example, if the user wants to do the transfer once a week, a more reactive version of SMA is used, instead of a more stable SMA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have tried out TransferWise APIs, connected Messenger APIs to the dotnetcore, added MongoDB data storage for caching user preferences, created a background worker for the running scheduled requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TransferWise APIs are made with a test environment, so not all requests were working as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the bot and simple architecture working in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was probably the best hackathon we participated in. We learnt a lot about financial markets, bots architecture, AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TransferBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that human language processing and bots are the future. The next for TransferBuddy is to execute commands as a real personal assistant. If we had more time, we would add more user flows, and conversation data, to  make bot behave like a human.
