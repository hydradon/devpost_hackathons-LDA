                <p>
                    We wanted to make trip planning much less stressful and quicker.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the node.js as our back-end while utilizing the Amadeus and Yelp APIs to retrieve data regarding travel and display everything using handlebars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to work with the asynchronous nature of Javascript gave us a few headaches when we were trying to utilize the APIs to retrieve data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully retrieve data using the APIs and process and display the travel information based on the preferences of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively use Restful APIs and build a website using handlebars.

                    What's next for PerfectPlanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to allow the user to input more preferences, display a bit more options for the user to choose from, and suggest places of interest, hotels, ground transportation, and destination tips for the user's trip.
