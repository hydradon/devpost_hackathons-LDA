                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    Pandora's Music Genome project + Netflix's recommendation algorithm

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on machine learning, we&rsquo;re able to help people discover new locations to travel that they are statistically very likely to enjoy. We ask a few guiding questions on what they like, and within 20 questions we should able to guess with 90% accuracy another place they&rsquo;d like to go. 
We base this on a corpus of datapoints derived from previous user interactions and a machine learning tool that Amazon released recently. We&rsquo;ve catalogued 500 cities on this. It&rsquo;s similar to the Netflix algorithm or Pandora&rsquo;s music genome project, but based on user data rather than expert tagging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning works differently than we thought! But we figured out a workaround.

                <p>
                    If people like it, we might make the tool public.
