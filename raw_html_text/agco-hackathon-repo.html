                    The problem with the current software implemented by AMCO is that the farmers have no real incentive to use it. 
Also, the methods in which the data is presented to them is not intuitive or easy to read at a glance.
We have a very user friendly web UI that displays the progress of the farmers in different product categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After we focused on the analysis, we gamified the experience. We did this by implementing a leaderboard system and scores for the week. By gamifying this we create motivation for the farmers to be more efficient and they can easily see how productive they are. Ideally, farm owners or commercial farmers will be able to manage multiple operators and reward them for efficiency on the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These features are what we hope allows for AGCO to drive the next way of efficiency and innovation in the agriculture industry.
