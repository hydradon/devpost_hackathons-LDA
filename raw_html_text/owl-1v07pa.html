                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to take on a challenge proposed by one of the event sponsors, Dogfish Mobile. We wanted to not only complete the assigned task, but also include additional features that interested us. We think the project turned out really well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Owl is an app that allows users to monitor the status of their API's. Users receive push notifications when an API goes down or when it returns to normal status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built in iOS with Swift. The back end was made in php7, using slimphp for our framework and propel orm for the database. Another part of the back end is in node.js, which ran all of the major processes, such as querying the API's, saving to the database, and sending push notifications. We also built a web front end as well, but it wasn't as complete as the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate facial recognition with OpenCV, but we were unable to finish within the time constraints of the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to work together to create a solid back end in a short period of time. It was very satisfying to see push notifications work as expected!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should take more time at the start of the project to determine which technologies to use, and consider the advantages of each. Many features that we implemented could have done quicker and easier using a different technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for owl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While this app is specific to the challenge presented by the sponsor, it could easily be expanded to monitor any system of API's. We would also like to complete and integrate the facial recognition, and expand the app for Android and web.
