                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always waste a lot of time trying to find good movies to watch. With our program, we want to help others avoid this dilemma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds three great movies to watch based on a genre that the user selects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we developed a website. We stored all the movie information in a .csv file and imported that to our program as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not so familiar with JavaScript, and encountered several errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get te website to work the way we wanted it to, and were able to further develop our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code with multiple languages within the same program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What2Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add more features such as the platforms where the movies are available, links to those platforms, a more descriptive summary, cast information, online ratings. And lastly, we could add more movies to our database so we can suggest more than 3 movies.
