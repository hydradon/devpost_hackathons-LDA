                    Our inspiration lies in the tiresome emails of happening events, here at UCMerced.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What our app simply does is organize happening events to give users the option to search for events they are looking to attend without having to see every email they receive of every single happening event.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We build our app with Java, Json, XML and used Android SDK.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We ran through an extensive amount of challenges. Some of these involved us understanding how to manipulate buttons and use them to our advantage. We also found many bugs within those bugs that made it close to impossible to disallowing us to create our app. For some of us, it was our first time experimenting with Android and Java, so it was difficult to understanding every aspect of the app and what each person had to do when they were new to the subject.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Something we are more than proud of is the fact we sincerely made it possible to transfer all happenings data of UC Merced and be shown in a drop down list of events with dates/times of those events with an included link to the find all the information of that specific event.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned that it is most important on what we do together, rather than what we do alone. We worked as a team throughout the 24 hours and made an idea come to life. Without the struggles, I don't think we wouldn't have made something possible. Together we learned to work as a team, use Android Studio and understand how Java works.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What is next for Appending's is the ability to press a button and gain easy access to happenings of a specified keyword. We also hope to offer an easier function to find events people are looking for by subjecting buttons to give users events of a specified topic/keyword.
