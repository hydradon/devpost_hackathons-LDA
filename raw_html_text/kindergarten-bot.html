                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    I have two small kids and occasionally I ran late, forget to check in or check out kids. All those operations can be done via SMS (it is the most comfortable way)
                </p>

                    Kindergarten Chat Bot allows you to:

                        check in or check out

                    <li>
                        tell that your child has different food requirements today
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        tell that you kid will no be attending the day care center for a few days.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, I scripted the scenarios I want to cover.
Secondly, I added welcome and thank scenarios.
Then, I took Amazon Lex and developed 9 intents to cover my scenario. Used Amazon Lambda to fulfil my intents, as well as, validate input in a few places.
Afterwards, I registered with Twilio and it just worked! SMS bots are rocking!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, I ran into quite a few challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The UI did more me a few strange things by replacing a parameter/slot twice, so all my sample utterances became invalid
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I cannot use numbers in the sample utterances and a few other characters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amazon LEX does not extract more samples from my ~ 10 samples I provided. I had to stay close to the input. I will need to run the bot, analyse and re-train it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I had to do everything with lambda functions. Would be nice if I can just write a sample reply in the UI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pretty unclear how to combine validation, partial validation and fulfilment with a dialog. (in my video when I provide some bigger instructions I need to insert a question with a confirmation to trigger the bot to continue)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to make and deploy a bot in just 4 hours (end to end).
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How to program for Amazon LEX (event structures and validation/fulfilment workflow).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Connect LEX with Twilio (before I used Slack)
                    </li>
                </ul>
