                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get to a high-renewables future, we need a grid in which electric load follows variable electricity supply. This "demand flexibility" can be created by deploying technologies like smart thermostats and electric water heaters that can turn on when there is an abundance of electricity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective ways to scale deployment of flexible electricity supply is by working with electricity companies in deregulated areas, so-called Retail Energy Providers, or REPs. REPs most care about building stronger relationships with their customers, and deploying new services can be a perfect way to do this.

                    Our team&mdash;Stride&mdash;has built a qualification engine for distributed energy resources. For every home, we analyze load data and many adjacent datasets and recommend the energy technologies that could most benefit the electricity supplier and the customer.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    There is an opportunity for utilities and customers to save money and increase reliability by shifting electricity loads.

                    We will test this idea with REPs in Texas, to see if this has legs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If so, we will further develop the logic to identify which technologies would benefit the customer most.
