                <p>
                    A social network that allow Ladies, women to educate one another to share information's about Pregnancy, Ovulation and Menstrual Cycle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of young Girls and Ladies does not know what it takes to become a woman and how they can manage their womanhood. I was in a car going somewhere and a very young Girl  that sat besides me all of a sudden started bleeding. .She was crying and taught that some wrong is happening to her. She was having menses. She has not be taught how to handle that and I believe that this may also be happening to others. So I decides to develop a social network just like facebook that can allow Ladies, Women to help educate their fellow women by sharing their ideas  on Pregnancy,Ovulations &amp; Menstral Cycle.  Though this app is near completion but we will finally rock it in less than 2 months time from now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the app is near completion, securing users account  is another issue.... Great thanks to cryptophoto.com for providing this excellent  Fast crypto-photo authentications Mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most paramount part of every applications is securing their Users Data from unauthorized access and Cryptophoto makes that more easier  for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why we must implement CryptoPhoto  Authentications.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With CryptoPhotos, No More
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        1.) No More Phishing Attack on Apps/Websites:
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    Phising Attack is an attack which redirect users to other website in other to steal their login credentials for unauthorized access. With CryptoPhotos, this is no longer possible.
Even if the user is careless enough and his login credentials are stolen by an attacker, The attacker still cannot access the stolen account because He still have to face Crypto Photo authentications which requires Codes that the attacker does not have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        2.) No More Session Fixation Attack or Session Hijacking:
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    With Crypto Photos, Session Fixation Attack and Session Hijacking is completely eliminated.
I know what this causes facebook to filter every Ip addresses of their Users  to ensure that their users account never get hacked.This attack normally occurred when attacker 
succeeded in setting up a session against the user in other to steal users information. This kind of attack is further prevented from the authentication codes serves from the venerable Cryptophoto.com Server...
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.)   In banking Sector,especially in the bank where I operate. They does  things similar to Crypto authentications but they are currently having issues with attacks and Users accounts compromise Here and then and this reduces the number of people accessing their E-banking Options...
This is what they do. When User is registering, He/She must be required to upload just one special photo he likes. During  Login authentications, as user enters Login Username and Password, that uploaded picture pops up before user are finally logged in. This have a serious security treat because an attacker can just download a copy of that image and set up a phishing site which can fool the user.  With CryptoPhotos, there is nothing to worry about because the crypto photos and its authentications codes is dynamic. Even if an attacker get the First photo, another photo with its authentication codes comes up. This makes it impossible for an attacker to break into the network.

                    Spreading the Good News.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While My app is coming up(Web,Ios and Andriod), as the first social Network to have integrated Cryptophoto Authentications Technology. Cryptophoto Companies should also spread the news to all network ranging from Banks,Social Network,E-commerce. etc. to help secure peoples data online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.)During Registrations, Users are required to get,or download and Save Cryptophoto Images as part of the registration Process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.) Users are then required to upload his or her Profile Photos and Cover Images .
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.)Users then Finally Logged in using his account username and password which is further
authenticated via cryptophoto algorithm Codes. If the codes on the images matched, Users are authenticated otherwise the user login will be denied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.)Once User logged In She can start posting and sharing Text Messages,Post Pictures and Videos to her friends just like in facebook. The app has all features in facebook like chat system, notification alerts, friends alerts system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.)People: option allow each members to connect with others in other to send friends request alerts,chats, to send sms and email messages etc.

                    Learning Crypto Fast Authentication Mechanism is very Interesting. Its extremely fast.
Also Learning Xmpp and Strophe.js for android and IOS version of the app development and synching it to nodejs to allow notification and Chat functionality in the Web version of the app is quite amazing.... Cryptophoto offers 100% security on users account data security. its is very easy to integrate and the best ever seen on the internet. my app rocks in less than 2 months from now and I wish to be the first social network to has used cryptophoto authentication. Others social network like Twitter,Facebook can now copy from me......
