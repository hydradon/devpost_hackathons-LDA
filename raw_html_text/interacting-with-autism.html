                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Low-functioning autism can make it difficult for families to engage with one another.  In addition, it is hard for researchers to study the condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jeff Munson has created a simple game using Kinect and the Unity engine to address these challenges.  In order to promote engagement, he wanted to add a control panel interface on an Android tablet that a family member or friend can use to create the scene and adjust other settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we wanted to improve the game play visual experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The existing game, run on a laptop and projected/displayed on a large screen, displayed back the camera feed, like a mirror, with the addition of a number of colored balloons, which players could pop by moving their hands to intersect with them.  It would load one of a handful of pre-created balloon locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, we created a control panel application that a family member or friend (the "partner") can use to create custom levels in real time. We also leveraged new built-in logic in the Kinect V2 to use a green-screen algorithm to replace the room with alternate environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic game was written in Unity, using a Kinect user interface.  We developed the control panel using Unity so that it can be more easily maintained without learning an additional language/environment and so that it can run on an Android or windows device.  The control panel is run on a tablet and communicates with the main program using a TCP connection to convey the locations for balloons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We leveraged new libraries with the Kinect V2 to show the player as a 3D model, rather than a 2D image like before.  In addition, we used green-screening to replace the background with a forest model.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team was new to Unity and the .net framework, so there was some learning required to implement these changes.

                    Contributing to a product that will have positive impact for people with autism and the community around it.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about autism, gaining more compassion for this population, and how games can be useful for connecting with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jeff Munson will continue developing the product.  Some short term goals are to implement network discovery, since right now the IP address is hard coded.  Long term visions include having a variety of games, automating upload of logs for research.
