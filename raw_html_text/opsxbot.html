                    OpsBot - A Slack Chatbot built on Amazon Lex for AWS Guides
                </h1>
                <p>
                    OpsBot enables a DevOps team to collaboratively assign and track tasks, share knowledge and collect resolution logs for issues faced during task execution. 
Runbooks are task templates that capture repetitive activities that the team performs, while Runlogs capture the task context including issues and resolution for reuse.
The bot uses runbooks and runlogs to ensure that team members have the resources they require to search for information regarding their tasks or designate 
tasks to others in their team. 
Users can search, filter runbooks and assign runbooks to others or pick them up for execution themselves. They can also check runbooks assigned to them and execute them. 
The execution phase creates runlogs which keeps getting updated at each step of the execution. Users can also raise issues they face during execution and look for 
resolutions available in the repository or on stackoverflow (via google custom search) or seek help from other team members by delegating the task, so the team member can
start from where the first user left off.

                        is a compilation of standard procedural operations or steps that dev execute sequentially for repetitive tasks. Though Runbooks are generally 
a set of how-to instructions which contains the steps needed to get a job done. Runbooks can also be tutorials or guides 
to walkthrough over relevant information and learn about standard dev tools, scripts, products or services. OpsBot currently stores runbooks in elasticsearch, 
crawled from AWS tutorials, troubleshooting guides and how-to manuals.

                        is an instance of a task execution enabling tracking it to completion while capturing contextual details of user, environment, dependencies, issues 
and corresponding resolutions. Runlogs are sharable within the team, enabling users to delegate sub-tasks to each other while maintaining the overall context.

                    Users can assign a particular runbook after searching and selecting one. The bot prompts user to enter the team members's name whom to assign and the date
when to assign. Upon validation, the runbook gets assigned and a runlog is created with entries such as originator, recipient, user, logtime, runbook id, runlog 
id, runbook name, status.

                    to execute a particular runbook assigned to them in the runlogs. At each step of the execution, user is prompted 
to mark a step as

                <p>
                    The execution process provides the user with the opportunity to raise errors or issues if need be at particular steps/tasks. The user is asked to provide a small 
description or summary of the issue whereby it gets logged into the runlog in a new field. Next, the user is shown resolutions for the issue which may be available
from some previously completed runlogs or from stackoverflow. The user is prompted to select a resolution and then shown the complete details present in it.
The user has an option to make it known whether the resolution was helpful. If yes, either the resolution count in runlog gets increased or the resolution gets 
updated in the runlog depending on whether the resolution came from the existing runlogs or from stackoverflow. Some command examples include:
                </p>

                    Lambdas are simple functions written in any of the supported AWS languages (python, javascript and java). Working with lambdas is quite easy to start with, but 
once you want to develop some complex integrations, it becomes a bit of a burden to deal with all the required steps to put some changes live. Gordon tries to 
make the entire process as smooth as possible.In gordon, Lambdas are resources that you&rsquo;ll group and define within apps. The idea is to keep Lambdas with the 
same business domain close to each other in the same app.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Download any external requirements your lambdas might have.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a zip file with your lambda, packages and libraries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upload this file to S3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a lambda with your code and settings (memory, timeout...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Publish a new version of the lambda.

                    <li>
                        Create an alias named current pointing to this new version.

                        Create a new IAM Role for this lambda and attach it.

                        As result, your lambda will be ready to run on AWS!

                    Gordon requires several python libraries, but all of them should get installed seamlessly using pip.
                    <code>
                        $ pip install gordon

                <p>
                    From the command line, cd into a directory where you&rsquo;d like to store your code, then run the following command:
                    <code>
                        $ gordon startproject demo
                    </code>
                    This will create a demo directory in your current directory with the following structure:

                <p>
                    Now that we have our project created, we need to create our first app. Run the following command from the command line:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>$ gordon startapp firstapp```
This will create a firstapp directory inside your project with the following structure:
```firstapp/
├── helloworld
│   └── code.py
└── settings.yml
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    These files are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        code.py : File where the source code of our first helloworld lambda will be. By default gordon creates a function called handler inside this file and registers 
it as the main handler.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        settings.yml : Configuration related to this application. By default gordon registers a helloworld lambda function.
Now that we know what these files does, we need to install this firstapp. In order to do so, open your project settings.yml and add firstapp to the apps list:
                        <code>
                            project: demo
default-region: us-east-1
code-bucket: gordon-demo-5f1fb41f
apps:
- gordon.contrib.lambdas
- firstapp
                        </code>
                        This will make Gordon take count of the resources registered within the firstapp application.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Now that your project is ready, you need to build it. You&rsquo;ll need to repeat this step every time you make some local changes and want to deploy them to AWS.

                    </code>
                    This command will have an output similar to:
