                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finals are starting this Thursday, so time to start planning how much time will be needed to review for each course! In order to help students save more time, we decided to build a website that can calculate grades needed in finals to pass the courses, OR, EVEN MORE, to get a 4.0 GPA!! Admit it, students struggle for grades so badly, some try to pass, some try to get full marks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our Grade Grinder, it will save lots of time. To get details of what needs to be scored in finals in order to reach a specific (grade) goal, it suffices to put the weight of each of the past evaluation (assignments, midterms, test, etc.), and Grade Grinder will calculate everything for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with java and was trying to use extends Applet to create a website from it. However, it was a bit out of our knowledge, so we changed to Glitch once we encountered the problem. We wrote the entire code on Glitch after having went to one of the workshop, which really helped us. We also used html and css to put the background and graphs for inputs and submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java did not work well with website, and we did not find a good tutorial related to it, which delayed the whole process. We had to learn html from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully learned html from scratch, the workshop was very helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html!!! and css and glitch and javascript within a short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grade Calculator - Mcgill standard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing all the errors, and maybe try to add more variables or set goals. Even more, make it more flexible.
