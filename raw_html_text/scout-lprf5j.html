                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members really needed help with PHP, and he had to write on a whiteboard to ask for help. A more experienced student saw the whiteboard and came to help him. Other times, we have been stuck in office hours for long periods of time when people in engineering buildings can quickly help us out. We wanted to create an app that helps university students get quick and efficient academic help from experienced students close by.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scout maintains a list of issues that students need help with and sends it out to students close by. If a student sees that they can help someone out, they get access to a messaging system so that the two students can meet up.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried simultaneously building a Swift app and a website. We finished an HTML/CSS/JS/PHP implementation, but only partially completed the Swift app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building the Swift app, we weren't able to finish our UITableViewController because a Abort trap 6 error kept halting our progress. Even though we finished the card layout and issue add controllers, we weren't able to compile them together successfully. Also, we didn't have enough time to complete a chat implementation with an AR feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website front-end is mostly finished, so that both students knowledgeable in their topics, as well as students needing help, can easily use the UI to ask questions or chat to meet up. The design is relatively simple and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons take a lot of time, and we should have prioritized perfecting certain functionalities over others to create an effective demo/pitch. We should have focused mostly on the front-end and realized that back-end does not have to be perfected now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep continuing to work on the application, especially the mobile application, to eventually release it at Cornell. We think it will be useful for underclassmen especially, who do not know a lot of their classmates and need help finding resources.
