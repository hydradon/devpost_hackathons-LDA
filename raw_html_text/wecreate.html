                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to share our unique experiences of our travels, whether it be tasting boba tea across the Bay Area, visiting the Golden Gate Bridge, or going out East to see the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of these experiences are tailored to the geographic location. A phenomenal way to boost and inspire the sense of community amongst Facebook users would be to build a digital collage of photos (enhanced with SparkAR) which are grouped based on geographical location and linked to their Facebook accounts.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Features a map with clickable points at locations of major cities (SF, NYC, etc.) where pictures can be viewed and uploaded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this product using React-Native for a mobile front end, SparkAR for enhancing user images, Express and Node.js for a image submission tool and the server itself, Heroku for deploying the server, and MongoDB Atlas to host a MongoDB database on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating an image submission tool with the server, sending and maintaining image data, communicating between React-Native and the Node.js/Express server, using Google Maps API on the React-Native front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully creating and deploying a server and an image submission tool, successfully creating a vivid front-end using React-Native that was able to communicate with our deployed server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storing images in MongoDB and send this data to to the front-end, creating a Google Maps layout with picture modals, markers, etc., enhancing images with SparkAR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeCreate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including videos, GIFs, etc., creating a more vivid UI, and providing "likes" to gamify and encourage user interaction with the shared digital content.
