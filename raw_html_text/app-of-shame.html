                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The many..many drunk tweets on the internet.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all had that moment. That moment when we hit send on a tequila fueled tweet we probably shouldn't. Unfortunately, our bosses do not appreciate pictures of us at a party at 3 a.m. App of Shame is a exposure management system designed to keep the user out of as much trouble as possible when they're "chocolate wasted." In it's current state, it is a proof of concept.  The app consists of a slew of features such as: localized chat room for party members, camera, setting an emergency contact, and a sobriety test.  A future version of the app would provide the ability to lock the phone to using the app until the user was able to successfully pass the sobriety test.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started building the SQL server needed for the chat system, using CURL to test server routes.  WE then developed much of the rest of the app using Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of sorting the messages properly on the server.

                    It works.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Charlie learned a crap ton of android code.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the product, fixing a few bugs, polishing the UI further, and offering more search options within the server for better sorting.
