                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always walk by Chipotle, Panda Express, or really any sushi place. I have an internal conflict every time I walk by them. My mind is telling me no, but my body, my body is telling me yes! More often that I'd care to admit I end up succumbing to the temptation, and my wallet has suffered on this account. I thought of a way to give myself an incentive, and what better way than to hack it up?!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You log every time you save money, how much, and with a little comment about what you saved it on. It stores and shows your history as to how much you've spent every day or week. At the end of the month, you specify a certain percentage of your monthly savings, input some things you would like to purchase from Amazon. This program takes your monthly savings, multiplied by the percentage you specified, searches your list of products, randomizes it, and buys one at random for you!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio (Java), Zinc API for the payment automation, third party views for the graph, Firebase for the back end and user authentication, and lots and lots of tears.

                    Android Studio, Firebase, and patience

                    Make it more cleaner, nicer, more secure, and overall more efficient, as well as features I didn't have the chance to implement.
