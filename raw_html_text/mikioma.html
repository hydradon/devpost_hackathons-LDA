                    The Mikioma Kingdom, the rulers of the Land of Aonar, led by Pontifex Lambda are in constant conflict with the Pinto Rebellion, led by their commander Harris of the Hammer. Once a hero of Kingdom, Harris was distraught by the atrocities the Mikioma Kingdom committed against their foes under Lambda&rsquo;s command. Knowing that his efforts would be in vain were he to take it upon himself to overthrow the leader, Harris and his loyal comrades banded to bring justice to the kingdom. Both factions find themselves fighting monsters originating from the Quinto region. Living in the dark shadows of the realm are the Jonkofs, a mysterious, invisible tribe consisting of evasive rogues.
