                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a application that allows two people speaking in different languages to communicate in their native tongues utilizing instant messaging technology. With the use of the Google Translate API, texts are converted to a target language after it's sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application first searches for chat threads from a mysql database, if it finds any it will have a link to the messaging page. On this page, the app pulls messages from the database and translates them into the user's language before displaying them. The user can also send messages from here that will be stored in the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to implement the back-end of our webpages through Python's Flask framework. Getting to do the translation in our webpages was relatively simple, but since we were using a private server, we ended up switching to PHP because it'd be more efficient to not focus on so many different languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A consistent issue that hindered our development efforts was the lack of functionality of the internet. There were additional things that the team wanted to implement but we could not access the resources to assist us. We had to use our data for large parts of the competition in order to get our project done on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem we ran into was building our webpages. Most of our group has not been expose to User-Interface for websites, so it was a first time to be learning HTML &amp; CSS. There were many things that we were unaware of how to do, like displaying a picture or positioning texts. It took us up to half the event to finish the home page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of our group, this was their first time attending hackathon. We all went out of our comfort zone in programming, and overcame the challenges that were put in front us. Everyone went into a new aspect of coding they were unfamiliar with, whether it was command line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned from the workshop provided and implemented the knowledge in our project. Some skills we learned were the ability to obtain authentication keys and applying the Google API in different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WorldView
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will likely perform further development n some of the modules that we did not include on the initial build. We will probably integrate a better login module that is compatible with various social media accounts as well. Improve on our website and move onto other mobile platforms.
