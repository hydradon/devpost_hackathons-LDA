                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fantasy sports have quickly evolved into one of America's favorite pastimes, and as fans of fantasy sports, soccer, and some healthy trash-talking alike, we thought it would be cool to improve upon the existing games out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to effortlessly find opponents to play against in order to prove their knowledge and passion for the game in a measurable way as well as gaining excitement with the involvement of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a web application using Django and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data gathering was the most challenging part, as well as some decisions regarding the business logic and trade-offs we had to make along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that we managed to deliver a promising MVP in a short amount of time that also looks pretty good considering neither of us has much experience with or love for design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learning a whole lot about Django and the MVC framework, as well as about web scraping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Panenka
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking to continue developing and improving our MVP and are looking to launch officially in the next coming months. A mobile version for Android and iOS is also in the horizon.
