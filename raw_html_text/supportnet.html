                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent this past fall semester abroad in Ireland and met many people who wanted to help the European refugees but did not know where or how. SupportNet was my idea to give people like this an opportunity to get involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects non-profits to donors in real-time to optimize the donation requests and offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase as a backend service, on which we used an angular.js library specific to Firebase, angularFire. We enabled real-time data updates by binding data objects to the visual data using angularFire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Firebase and Angular.js proved difficult since none of us had used Firebase before. We also had some trouble making the website clean and pretty in the short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our work with Firebase despite our lack of experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to use Angular.js and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SupportNet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our out of scope pats of the project we were unable to implement include a location detection which shows users the closest donation center requests to them. We also hope to implement an addition to the pickup of donations by including a postal service host or pickup service on the website. In the future, we would like to add more specific functionalities which allow for-profit organizations like retailers or restaurants to donate to non-profits.
