                    Have you ever gone to the bathroom and realized you were on your period only to find that you didn't have any feminine products with you.  But luckily, everyone carries around their phones! Instead of facing the awkward task of walking back into a classroom just to walk back out again (with a bag) or calling your friends for help, you can send out a distress call and see if any other app users in the area can come to your aid! Gain points for helping others out and rate others on their level of help.  Reach the level of Good Samaritan to Angel to Savior! After you make a distress call and another user accepts your call for help, a chat opens to allow private conversation and coordinate pickup.
