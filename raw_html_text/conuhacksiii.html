                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a web app that would make a difference in society. One of the largest groups of people who require assistance are our elders. Our mission is to make sure they stay on top of their treatments and take great care of themselves.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a user, you can sign up for the website, and then you'll have the ability to register others under your account, by specifying their name, medication, dosage, dose unit and phone number. We'll then make sure the person always receives a message when it's time to take their medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the front end we used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery, and Ajax. For the backend we used PHP+Slim, SQL, MySQL database and an Apache server. We also used the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a little difficult to use the Twilio API since we ran into many problems connecting to their server.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
