                    We analyzed input strings using a modification of the Markov chain algorithm, which generates random strings that have similar patterns to the input. Given the past quotations of a character, this can generate chatbot AIs with a similar personality and lexicon, and our modification makes them talk to each other. By generating each successive sentence off of a word in the previous sentence, we hold conversational continuity.

                    To use, add characters at the bottom of the page by giving them names and source data. Once you are done, just hit "start the conversation", sit back, and watch the show.
