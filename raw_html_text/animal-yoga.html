                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve always wanted to develop tools that help children self-sooth and develop emotional self-regulation skills. I learned that yoga helps manage stress through breathing, awareness, meditation, and healthy movement. Young children love animals, so any yoga pose that associates an animal name is wonderful because it conjures playful, relatable animal behavior that helps yoga feel more like play. 
The best way to introduce calming strategies is by practicing it in the moments when the child is calm and practicing them for short periods, but very regularly, preferably every day. Alexa is a great format for the purpose of this project because it offers a hands-free easy access in a home environment where parents can model the process themselves to show their child exactly what to do. Children will learn that the exercise can help them calm down the next time they feel overwhelmed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animal Yoga provides children a fun yoga experience through imaginative play, breathing, stretching, and healthy movement. It encourages their creativity and imagination, builds their strength and flexibility, increases their body awareness, balance, and coordination, and provides them with emotional regulation tools.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Javascript, Lambda, S3 and Audacity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small children have shorter attention spans than adults.  How can I make it as playful as possible to engage young children? Lots of time spent on incorporating SSML, Speechcon to make the voice more animated, simplifying languages to make the yoga pose sequences easily understandable, adding short animal stories and sound effects to entice children to stay interested.
