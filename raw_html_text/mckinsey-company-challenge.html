                    It's a challenge for the Mckinsey during the Hack UPC 2019. It was great learning more things about data manipulation and traffic accidents.

                    The submission file may be a different format therefore it might not be best for validating the model efficiency. It is because I've merged the test_csv file with the vehicles.csv file, therefore there are more than 1 entries per accident id and the predictions for the different entries might be different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had another solution using only accidents.csv which was of the correct format, but I decided to include the vehicles.csv in order to include more features.
