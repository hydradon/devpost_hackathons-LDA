                    Inspiration: We wanted to learn how to develop an Android app to learn new thing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It is pretty useless app that does nothing but shows numbers when you tap a button.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We learned how to use Unity to build the app in it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: How to use Unity. We had to watch couple videos and ask couple friends.
                </h2>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We were able to get the app to work as we intended.
