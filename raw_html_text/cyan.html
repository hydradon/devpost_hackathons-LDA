                <p>
                    Anxiety affects half a billion individuals globally, while less than 30% percent in developed countries do not have adequate resources to deal with the mental condition.

                <p>
                    Our solution introduces a platform that extracts and analyzes biosignal data from a smart device to initiate a relaxation procedure for individuals who may experience anxiety. Our focus challenge is the mental health hack,

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused more on idea formulation, development, and feasibility instead of the technical aspect of the project, as our team members were not as experienced in programming as most hackers. We were able to use basic front-end applications, such as Photoshop to demonstrate what our app would look like.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forming an app that demonstrates the capabilities of the platform. Our team did not have an experienced programmer, so we could not make a product within the time limits. Instead, we focused our time on developing the idea.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    The availability and variety of different programming kits and environments to use for different projects that may require a variety of features from text-alerts to chat rooms.

                    Marketing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic flow for our marketing plan consists of presenting user data we acquire from testing to hospitals and doctors. The data should convince these professional stakeholders that the app is useful in treating immediate anxiety or spikes in stress. These doctors would then have this tool to recommend to their in-treatment patients, check-up visitors, and family/friend groups. Doctors could also give a referral code to obtain data from patients they recommend the app to. This data can be used for the hospital in any medical studies, with the patient's approval of course.
