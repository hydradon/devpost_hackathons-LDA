                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always get a sense of dehydration and we know ti is bad.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can track how much water you drink.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Notepad++ and coded it using Python and HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Updating the database in the correct format. Making a table. Updating the total amount of water that you drank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like how the website turned out and also of how it can register different people into the database and log them in and store their data. We also feel proud of how we were able to update the total amount of water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to style a website using HTML and also storing databases in comma-separated value files. The most important thing was updating the .csv file via browser input.
                </p>
