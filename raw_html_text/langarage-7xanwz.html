                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The members of LanGarage have experienced the difficulties of learning another language. Having used study websites such as Quizlet, we are all familiar with the benefits of a versatile study tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As useful as a website like Quizlet may be, entering information into the virtual flashcards can often be tedious--especially translations. LanGarage improves input efficiency for language learners, as it uses the Google Translate API to translate your native language vocab list into your target list (choose from over 35 languages!). Then, it uses these lists to create question sets for your study aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LanGarage takes in a list of vocabulary words in your native language and then creates a translated list in your language-to-be-learned. Then, the program creates a set of random multiple choice questions to test you. The program keeps track of your total score and ends when the question set is empty.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and implementation of Google Translate API.

                    <strong>
                        There are not many resources in terms of Google Translate API usage, but thankfully, the mentors were very knowledgeable and provided us guidance.
                    </strong>
                    Figuring out the difference between front-end and back-end capabilities and working around API-implementation issues proved difficult but ultimately rewarding.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to write JavaScript and HTML/CSS in conjunction with each other (we had little experience with the three languages beforehand, relying on online learning resources). We were able to learn and implement Google Cloud&rsquo;s translation API by utilizing XMLHttpRequest, both being new experiences for us.

                    Adding more languages and statistics, adding more &ldquo;game modes&rdquo; (matching, etc.), creating accounts and flashcard decks, switch to platforms (iOS, Android, etc.)
