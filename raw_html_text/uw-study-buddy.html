                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance communication between students and productivity of studying for students in the University of Waterloo.

                    &lsquo;UW Study Buddy' targets all students who attend the University of Waterloo. Whenever they want to study and get some help from other students, they can find study buddies and do not feel like studying alone.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we analyze some socializing apps and UW apps to generate the idea of UW Study Buddy.
Then, we write down the problem statement and our general plan of UW Study Buddy.
After that, we used Figma to build the prototype of UW Study Buddy. 
Finally, we compared UW Study Buddy with the other socializing apps and think about the future step.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenging thing is we want this app to be useful in the aspects of both socializing and studying, and 24-hours is not enough time to build the project that balance these two sides perfectly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UW Study Buddy is a user-friendly app. Students can simply login to the app, and choose the date and time that they are going to study. Eventually, the locations will be provided for them to select (places on campus ). In this case, UW Study Buddy will randomly select a UW student based on their preferences.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the 24-hour hackathon, we learned to use Figma.  Also, we explored the fields that we were not familiar before, and working with teammates in different streams helps us to understand the connections between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UW Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to do some market research and consider about the consumer demand by analyzing the feedback from students. If Study Buddy works well in the University of Waterloo, we can make it available for other universities students and upgrade the app by adding more functions like location sharing.
