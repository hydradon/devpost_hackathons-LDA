                    This is a web platform and (in a future) mobile app, where user can:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create own city tours with TomTom maps
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vote for a ready tours
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Just experience the existing tours and enjoy time in the city as a local
## How we built it
We used tomtom API's provided for the challenge. Frontend part created with React. To test an app we developed database API with Mongodb.
## Challenges we ran into
It is challenging to choose an idea after brainstorming. Also we are students of the first semester. For us it is first hackathon and we learnt a lot during this challenge. Now we would be better prepared for the next one
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to choose an idea that every team member likes. We managed to work with TomTom API using Rect and Node
## What we learned
Working as a team. Working with map API
## What's next for Locals 
We will continue to work on placing markers on map and creating routes.
