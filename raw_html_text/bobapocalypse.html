                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concept was partially inspired by agar.io. The boba theme emerged because many of my prior projects (both coding and non-coding) are food related. I'm an avid foodie, so food is always a go-to theme for me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came up with the world changes because I wanted to spice it up somehow, so that players would want to keep playing.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I kept all the gameplay code in one swift file and made a function that would change the textures of the objects, so all "levels" rely on a single swift file, rather than each level having its own class/swift file. The world-change essentially reloads the scene with new textures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transition between the worlds was somewhat difficult because I had to make sure the transition animation (done programmatically) finished _ before _ the next scene loaded in. To solve this I worked a lot with sequences and "wait" actions. Another challenge was having the enemy boba "shrink" at the correct rate as your score increases. At first, there were some cases where the number on the boba was smaller than the player number, but you died on contact because the enemy boba did not shrink by the right ratio. I solved this using trial and error, by adjusting the "scale by" ratio, and making it so that if the boba label is equal to player's score, the enemy will be scaled to the same size as the player.
                </p>

                    Implementing the transition between the levels, and making it so that I can use a single swift file/class for all my "worlds."
