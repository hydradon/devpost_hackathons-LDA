                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a love for the game Minecraft and want to develop for the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adds a multitude of food items to the game, which are all obtainable through the survival game mode.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used eclipse to setup files, and used a youtube series to help us with aspects we didn't know how to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .json files not working
modles not rendering properly
incorrect file paths and names
little to no experience in visual design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem solving our way out of problems such as the models not rendering.
Creating somewhat decent textures for items.
Being able to successfully create a working mod in a short time span.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modding minecraft is a much more difficult and repetitive process.
Older versions of minecraft require different versions of java to run.
Creating textures in small size frames is very difficult to do well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food X Mod for Minecraft 1.12.2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More foods to create.
New crafting stations for more advanced crafting recipes, and reusing old recipes to fit said crafting stations.
Better models for item textures.
