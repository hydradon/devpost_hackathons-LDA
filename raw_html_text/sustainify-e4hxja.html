                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the plan that this hackathon gave us to create an initiative that makes the campus more sustainable through awareness and also brings UWaterloo together. Some platforms which were inspirations were Eventbrite and Facebook events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform allows clubs to create events and share them with other students within the University of Waterloo to join. Users register for an account on our site through our registration screen and then use that information in the login screen to attend events. The platform has a rewards program where users can receive WatCard funds or gift cards which will be distributed after the students have attended a specific amount of events. The platform checks the users attendance through email communications with the host of the event confirming the attendance with the names they receive from us. Sustainify receives funding through restaurant recommendations and ads on the website for local sustainable locations in Waterloo to eat food. The events updated are manually checked to certify that they are initiatives that support the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GitHub pages to host our website containing the information for each of our pages coded in html, CSS, google APIs, and JavaScript. We replaced the back-end with a temporary solution on the front end by using JSON files to store user information due to time constraints. To collaborate together, we utilized the atom teletype extension so multiple users could modify the code simultaneously. We also utilized GitHub by creating a repository to store the information. Our domain was received through Dot tk as we had some technical problems with the the MLHFUN code on domain.com which provides us with a website domain for free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process we faced many problems related to the software side of the platform. Initially we had to implement APIs and use the provided google cloud credit to add the google maps java-script API platform which we had a few technical issues to setup the account. We then faced issues with changing the icon designs of the markers on the website as well as changing between html and JavaScript within out index.html file. With some assistance from the mentors, we had resolved these issues. We needed to create a back-end for our website to store user information however we did not have the knowledge or time to resolve that so we used JSON files on the front-end to store that information for our prototype.
                </p>
