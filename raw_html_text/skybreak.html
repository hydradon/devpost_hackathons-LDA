                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was our love for travel and simple addictive games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining a simple plane game with real flights data with real data from the skyscanner api, skybreak lets you accomplish your dreams by flying all across the globe. Starting from London, you can pick your flight. The price of the flight you take is taken away from your wallet and the distance covered by your flight is added to your score. A flight corresponds to a game and the longer you remain on flight without hitting a cloud or falling off screen, the more money you gain.
This game is a combination  of strategy in terms of picking the best flights and gaming skills in terms of making a flight last as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js to get the flights data from the skyscanner api and C# with unity to create the front-end of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the distance between two airports required getting a database of airports with their locations and using the latitude and longitude took us some time. We also had to learn C# and unity during the project and set up a webserver for highscores.
                </p>
