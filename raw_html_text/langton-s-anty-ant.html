                    Ants are my only inspiration, we made an ant move around in a grid. We built it using processing, and the most challenging part was to get the ant to move in our EXACT algorithm. EXACTTT. I am proud of getting the ant to actually move in our EXACT algorithm, and I learned that ants are very lazy, as well as the algorithm required. We think we want to make Langton's ant even more antsy by adding more ants.
