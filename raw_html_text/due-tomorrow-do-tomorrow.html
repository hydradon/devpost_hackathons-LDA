                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I often procrastinate too much by surfing on the internet and one of the reasons is because I don't always know what I'm supposed to be doing and am too lazy to use an agenda or calendar to keep track of tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Chrome extension that opens a to-do list page whenever a new tab is opened. The backgrounds (from Unsplash) change every time you open it. You can add tasks, check off tasks that are completed, and edit or cancel tasks. Also, you can set alerts to pop up at a specified time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a lot of online tutorials about html/css/javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never done anything related to Javascript before and thought of this idea halfway into the hackathon so I had no time and no experience.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a complete beginner and have never done any programming projects so I am really happy that I could get something to work.
                </p>

                        Sleep is for the weak
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Side projects" aren't as impossibly hard as I thought they were
                    </li>

                    What's next for due tomorrow != do tomorrow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to use Local Storage so that every time you refresh or close the tab, or open a new tab, the list of tasks will be saved.
