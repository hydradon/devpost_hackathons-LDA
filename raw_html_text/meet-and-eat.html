                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've seen a lack of communication between others because of technology isolating us rather than connecting us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to either host or join a lunch with a specified amount of people (for example you can choose to have a 2 person lunch or if you want, a 6 person lunch). When hosting you list a time frame, type of food, and interest, while people who join lunches can choose where they would like to go based on their preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Html, css, javascript, figma; we used html, css, and javascript for the website and figma for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started debating on whenever we should add a message functionality into the application but we've decided against it. We also had trouble organizing div files correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app looks great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideas don't always come into fruition and we have to compromise sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meet and Eat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If possible we would like to go beyond the prototype and produce a functional app.
                </p>
