                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Akada's purpose is two-fold. It serves both to demonstrate the versatility of the Kaeon FUSION, and to provide a proof of concept for a service that would allow individuals to earn the necessary credentials for their chosen career path without attending college.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the Akada site entirely using Kaeon FUSION, a new language I've been developing that can handle the full stack with a single syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to iron out some glitches with the Kaeon FUSION interpreter.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It may actually be the best looking website I've ever made.
                </p>

                    What's next for Akada
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm hoping to expand its scope and eventually release it as a much more sophisticated product.
