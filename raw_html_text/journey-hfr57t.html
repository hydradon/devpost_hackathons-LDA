                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to be able to walk in someone's shoes through the music they listen to. It might be a road trip, or a walk in a romantic park -- and you'd be able to share the 'public's playlist' based on where you are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SHARE - users can choose songs and share what songs they're listening to at a particular location or stretch of walk
                </p>
                <p>
                    LISTEN - users can listen to the most played songs by others users based on their location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask Python for the backend
Firebase as the database
HTML, CSS and Javascript for front end
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We changed our ideas 8 times and spent a lot of energy changing our ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we could not technically execute it very well.

                    Not much. We took showers?

                    What I learned

                    Don't keep changing ideas.

                    Maybe we'll build properly next time.
