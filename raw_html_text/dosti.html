                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know how difficult it can be for college students to socialize and find people with common interests, especially in the initial (the most critical) stages of college. We wanted a platform to help people socialize without the fear of not knowing what to talk about to help them create long-lasting and meaningful friendships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can add tags to their names for corresponding interests which are stored in our database. Users can then search for tags and find people with common interests as them. Another important functionality in this app is the google maps integration which allows you to see people with a certain amount of common interests as you within a 0.1-mile radius (the friendzone) around you. Even if you are not using the app, it sends you a notification if someone it recognizes you might be interested in talking to is near you. You can also click on tags and look at all the events related to that tag occurring soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an IOS app which we built using Xcode and Swift. For backend, we used Firebase for storing user data and authentication for login.

                    Building an app that works.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot. From android dev (which our app isn't about) to integrating google maps API in ios apps.
