                    BucketList_ aims to revolutionize the way traveling is conducted in the everyday life of wunderlust individuals. Users enter a bucketlist of places to go, a duration of time to stay in these places, a budget, and timeframe within which they want to complete this list by - they may also include optional events they want to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BucketList_ then aggregates the information and comes up with a list of possible travel times based on a users' Calender. Their availability is used as a refrence to come up with an optimal time to go on a trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With BucketList_ the opportunities are endless.

                    In order to get QJSONObject working with C++ we used
                    <code>
                        brew install qt5
                    </code>
                    from Homebrew to get the latest version of QT working with our library documents.
