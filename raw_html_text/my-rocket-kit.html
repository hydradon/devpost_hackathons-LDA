                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by memories of my elementary school's rocket club many years ago.  I wanted to inspire the same enthusiasm in my kids for this STEM hobby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like the idea of using voice commands to build things.  I think we have only scratched the surface in this area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill allows the user to pick various characteristics of their virtual rocket and then launch it with a count down.  As they launch more rockets, they achieve higher skill levels which unlock higher powered engines and new mini-features within the skill.  The mini-features include rocket facts, the NAR safety code, and info on clubs and organizations. I.e. (NAR, Nasa, etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the v2 ASK-SDK for Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After watching my kids use the app I found my initial attempt was far too wordy and they were quickly losing interest.  Rewards had to come quickly or they would tune out.  Kids older than mine might be a bit more tolerant to the academics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulty figuring out how to use some of the features of the ASK-SDK worked like addRenderTemplateDirective and withCanFulfillIntent.  I eventually did get addRenderTemplateDirective working after a little digging in Github.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting kids to interact with the skill and excited about rocketry.  I customized some of the messages based on their skill level and used persistence to DynamoDB to remember their level in future sessions.  I used display templates for the first time and complete ad skill with more complex interactions that builds upon previous interactions.
                </p>

                    Persistence (DynamoDB), how to use addRenderTemplateDirective.

                    What's next for My Rocket Kit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really would like to dynamically build/render an image/model of their rocket based on the options they chose instead of showing them a generic assembled rocket.  I simply ran out of time. :(
