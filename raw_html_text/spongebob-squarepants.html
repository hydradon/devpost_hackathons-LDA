                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saw random youtube video when thinking of what project to do. Big part of my childhood and thought it would be fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reels spin and wins are calculated accordingly via a certain multiplier of the stake they chose to play. 3 bonus games each have a 1 in 20 chance of appearing win extra cash. There is "Guess the friend", "flip the patties" and "Driving test". The game also has a create account/login system to keep a track of the money you've earned and will save for future times paying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used win forms to create the backgrounds and set images to picture boxes. Programmed the changes and calculations using c#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One page randomly deleted all its functions and when "re-enabled" still acted as though it had no function. Also had trouble calculating the total win multiplier when bonus games were played due to how the variable was being passed.
                </p>

                    Actually completing (well mostly) the project despite spending all night awake and being very tired
