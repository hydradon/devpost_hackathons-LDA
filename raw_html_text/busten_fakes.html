                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my mentors was listing to NPR . Me about most of the verification site software does this by having you determining if we were humans and able to read and look at information an process considering that computers are bad at multitasking. It started out being something like that, but then what I got from th is that it would make sense to try and build should do build a tool that would look for data manipulations within jpg  to see if the data had been manipulated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It should allow look at the huffman encoding of a jpg to been whether or not   any changes have been determine not these changes make sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two computers and lot compile time a-lot of looking at background information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing the language . This was a bit of a frustration for me, because I am not the most solid of coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the language and being able to understand the coding practices of go  a bit more especial when it comes to the import error that can occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where that  go has similarity between several different languages , an can be a fun language to keep up with. We also learned about how a jpg  is processed from something called huffman's encoding this allows the user to be able to condense information down and still be able to retain the most prominent portions of it .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for busten_fakes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would say that trying to expand it do a sweet of things. Including reading an iinterrupting the meta-data and being capable of see whether there have been changes. Is allowing the user to look at more then one photo and letting them be capable of determining whether or not they agree with the service that we have provided. We are going to have to add in a either our own meta-data analysis tool or perhaps call another one from code that exist.
