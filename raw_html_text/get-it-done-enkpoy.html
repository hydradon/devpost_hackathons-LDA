                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Jack, was inspired by his dad to create Get-It-Done. His dad works as a freelance landscaper and owns a small business in Vancouver, BC. When he first started his work, he had trouble finding and acquiring new clients and had to rely on his network to get contracts. Similarly, those without access to higher education or specialized training often have trouble finding jobs that pay higher than minimum wage. It was important for our team to address this issue because hiring people with specialized training can be time-consuming and costly, when the jobs themselves could be completed by someone without experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get-It-Done is an online platform that allows users to work niche, labour jobs and earn extra income on their own time. Users sign up and provide their availability, preferred work locations, and niche skills, such as grocery shopping or mowing lawns. Consumers can then request work from those who are currently available in their area of interest and who possess the skills that they need for the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and Swift for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Alamofire to connect the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those with less programming experience focused on designing the user interface. For this, we used Figma to create the layout of each page, and Miro to visualize the control flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was figuring out how to configure the Alamofire HTTP framework and link it to our Xcode project. To overcome this challenge, we consulted with mentors, watched YouTube tutorials, and read Stack Overflow threads for guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we faced was having a mentor tell us that our overarching idea existed through a few other companies. Get-It-Done, however, is different because users are not selling their services as a product&mdash;they instead provide their availability, location, and labour skills and are offered jobs by consumers. Users can then focus on doing good work for good reviews rather than searching for job opportunities or marketing their services. Moreover, consumers can immediately see the hours during which users are available, eliminating the need to make time arrangements. They can also set their own hourly rate for the job and negotiate it with the user instead of paying for a service. Allowing the user to negotiate pay rates and say no to job offers puts both parties on an even platform. This makes the hiring and job searching process more efficient and accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, we managed to successfully create a working backend with a database of users. Furthermore, we were able to use Alamofire to access the database within the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team consists of four first-year university students. For all of us, this is our first or second hackathon, so although we do not have much programming experience, we are proud of how well our team worked together and utilized each other&rsquo;s skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Alamofire, third party libraries in Swift, and optionals on the frontend. We also learned how to use Figma and the hackathon basics&ndash;Git, Devpost, and Miro.
