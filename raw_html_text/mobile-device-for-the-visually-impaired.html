                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always believed that in developing, emphasis is put on sticking to the status quo. To develop on what exists. Such a mentality helps, but it limits innovation as people are afraid to restart. To come up with a completely new idea. To revolutionize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hurts people with disabilities. For example, displays are not useful to those who are visually impaired in devices like desktops or phones. A completely new UI could be made, and it could make interaction more efficient. It could connect people to the world better, but such  device has not been implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets people who are visually impaired connect to the world in a more efficient and easy manner. Tailored to them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I printed the housing, got an arduino and put the arduino on the housing. The 3D printed housing holds the arduino and wires in and the battery as well. The wires I then hooked up as pins on my hand. While this is not the most elegant solution, it is one I had the resources to make. I then tested and tested. I edited my code and tested some more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have the resources to develop a complete prototype with internet connectivity and calling, but I did make a proof of concept with local text storage. The housing is also a little messy because for this project I didn't have fabrication materials. My arduino stopped connecting to my computer because the arduino editor did not work, and I spent a while trying to fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to restart my code and I got it done in a little while. 
I did manage to have a project with hardware housing without needing more time or resources than provided.
