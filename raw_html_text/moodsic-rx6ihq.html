                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who hasn't ever felt stressed and wanted to listen to peaceful music? Or perhaps felt really excited and wanted to have epic music ful-surround and imagine to be driving in the middle of a Highlands-like landscape? Well, wouldn't it be cool to turn on the laptop, ask him for music and immediately have the music you want without having to ask him to?
                </p>

                        Moodsic
                    </strong>
                    reads your face using a camera (eg your laptops webcam) and learns your mood. Then it uses this info to pick an appropriate music for your mood.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        Microsoft's Cognitive API
                    </strong>
                    * for the facial recognition and a .NET environment for the development (C#, XMAL, WPF). For the music selection we used
                    <strong>
                        Rhythm API
                    </strong>
                    by Gracenote Developer. Finally, the songs are directly downloaded from YouTube.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lack of an official/universal implementation to use the webcam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficulties to get audios/videos from songs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using WPF environment, which lacks of community support compared to older environments.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        Developing with an environment which was completely new to all of us.

                    <li>
                        Exciting and useful APIs.

                    <li>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ordered from easier to harder to implement:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Allow the user to choose the genre, era, or artist they want to listen to if they want something more specific.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a personal library of music combined with Internet-retrieved music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improve the parallelism of the application for the downloads to avoid making the user wait.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use ML to better predict what the user wants to listen to. We've thought of a neuronal network with user's mood as input and the track's
                        <em>
                            mood
                        </em>
                        and genre as outputs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improve the UI. (sorry not fans of front-end)
