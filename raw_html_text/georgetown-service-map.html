                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the shear number of resources Georgetown has to offer, especially to students from marginalized communities and students facing roadblocks in their Georgetown career, but at how many students don't use them. We have found that one of the major barriers to accessing these resources is how out of the way they are, and how the only students who use them are students who have been introduced to them through a friend of a program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Georgetown Service Map provides the physical location of many resources Georgetown students are aware of, but may not now exactly how to access. By either clicking on color-coded markers, or by selecting the resource from a drop-down menu, a user can view that resource's contact information, a basic description of what services the resource provides, and how to physically get to the resource (a common problem given many of their hidden locations).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Google Maps' JavaScript API, connected to an HTML document and a style sheet. The website serves its content off of Google Cloud
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original plan was to make the map as an app. However, we realized that the tool would be much more accessible as a website. Neither of us have extensively used HTML or JavaScript, nor have either of us set up a website. Learning how to do all of those things was ... a good learning experience. We also both had commitments through the beginning of the hackathon, and only had 16 hours to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we successfully made a hack and got it published on the internet. While not the most comprehensive tool right now, we're proud that we have something that can be built upon to provide a more comprehensive overview of how to accessibly navigate Georgetown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a website is hard, that JavaScript is an annoying language, and that hackathons are very rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Georgetown Service Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to see a lot more features added to the map. In particular, we would like to see a map of gender-neutral bathrooms and wheelchair accessible routes added to the map, as well as other resources we may have missed throughout the hackathon. As more resources are added, we would also like to expand features so that the markers for different types of resources can be easily added and removed from the map, as well as other layering options.
