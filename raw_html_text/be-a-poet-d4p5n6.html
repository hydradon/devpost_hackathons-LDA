                    Inspiration: I'm always impressed with watching skilled teachers, and have wanted to enjoy that same gratification that they do when their students "get it".
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Adds fun to skill building for preschoolers in rhyming, counting, learning the days of the week and the months of the year.  Incorrect answers are handled in a constructive and engaging manner, so that learning sticks.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I used tools developed by Maksim Abramchuk and Vasili Shynkarenka, called Storyline
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: I'm not the best poet myself!  So, I had to keep it simple and use a rhyme generator from the web.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  Getting the skill to pass certification on the first run!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:  My inner child still wants to learn!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Be a Poet: Most likely more pre-school projects, and if successful, an expansion into adult poetry (with help from actual poets!).
