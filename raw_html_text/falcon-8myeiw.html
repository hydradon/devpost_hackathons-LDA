                <p>
                    To connect everyone (customer, small, big business houses) through one platform for their mutual benefits.

                <p>
                    The objective of this project is to create a platform, which brings small business owners and customers together and create a continuous data flow between them for their mutual benefit. Currently all the ad/data platforms mostly target online customers and online activity, we want to bring the customers offline activity online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today amid plethora of online buying options, customer still do a lot of offline purchases like daily needs, clothes, medicines etc. Currently there is a lack of one single platform where we store this data. We are trying to solve the same. Apart from providing the platform for customers, we will also provide  platform for small business owners to run campaigns / daily, weekly offers. Using the customer purchasing history we will serve them ads based on their behavior and geolocation.
