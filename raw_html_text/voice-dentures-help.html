                    What is does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code works with google home SDK and an api by GTK to take questions about dentures asked to the google home and answer the question and give some additional information.
                </p>

                    Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to help make teens/young people feel more comfortable with the idea of dentures.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was getting the GTK api to communicate with our programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was actually the second project we worked on during the hackathon. We originally worked with TensorFlow to design a machine learning program that takes an aerial view photo and returns what percentage of the photo is urban and what percentage is greenery. We had a lot of trouble working with this and eventually decided to change our project.
