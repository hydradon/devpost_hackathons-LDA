                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a child, I loved to play adventure games. Sure, I was fine with shooting games and tower defense, but there was just something so
                    <em>
                        engrossing
                    </em>
                    about a good story. Nowadays, I don't get much time to read books, but I still have the memories of certain games and their stories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon pressing a button, the app reads your location, determines the type of place you are at (restaurant, school, etc), and plays an associated piece of background music, often from the games I play. The previews in this app represent older games as well as newer ones, just as my childhood was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio to develop basic app functionality and the Google Places API for Android to get rich location data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Working with the Google API was really tough for me. Between Tasks, Buffers, and other strange-looking object names, I was initially very confused. Over time (and lots of documentation reading - my browser history is a
                            <em>
                                mess
                            </em>
                            ), I learned what these things meant and built this app.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Originally, I was going to build a 'party mode' where the app would analyze conversations around the device to determine the general mood of a place and play corresponding music. I also had plans to use a Watson API to figure out the feelings. Unfortunately, I found out 3 hours into this hackathon that
                            <em>

                            . I don't own an android device, so that was the end of the road for the 'party mode' :(

                        <p>
                            The Google API doesn't reliably return names of places, but

                            reliably return addresses. There is hard code in here for proof of concept.

                            At about 2 AM, Google had the bright idea to make my device appear to be in a remote location in Alabama (which still happens occasionally!). It took me until about 6:30 AM to find a workaround. On the bright side, if that ever happens again, I've added a "middle of nowhere" sound file.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my third Android app to date. Considering how the first two were Hello World apps, I knew next to nothing coming into this hackathon. Given this app, I think I've made quite an improvement. Learning a ton of Android and APIs was exhausting and stressful, but really rewarding, even with small victories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also didn't have a team on this one, and I am proud that I could learn all of this independently.

                        Finding a way to make that speech to text work, probably by buying/renting/borrowing a physical android phone.

                        Remove the hard code that negotiates addresses with place names. Someone probably has an API for that.
