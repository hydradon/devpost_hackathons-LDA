                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to shine light on women in the STEM field who have contributed just as much as men but are still in the shadows. Considering the theme is "Go Beyond", we wanted to focus on Women in Space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to externalize these women in the MagicVerse using the Magic Leap Augmented Reality Headset and display them in a museum-like environment. It's purpose is to educate those looking through the headset about the timeline of the Woman who have interacted with the progression of Space Travel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Unity, Scripting in C#, Lumin SDK, and Magic Script. We also used Blender to create the assets and Adobe Photoshop to create the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the version of Unity and Lumin SDK to be correctly installed was the first and hardest challenge.After that we had a hard time using the Dot Mesh feature on Unity so that we could scan the walls and place the assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to push the project onto the headset and get input from the controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manipulate the assets and place them where we wanted to. As well as getting input from the controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Women In Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we started off with the Women in Space, there was so much work done behind the scene of Space Travel. All the Women who contributed to Space Exploration, whether it be by calculating the trajectory of a spaceship launch, or programming the actual machinery in the Spaceship, all the Women who achieved milestones in Space Exploration, we would like to shine a light on.
