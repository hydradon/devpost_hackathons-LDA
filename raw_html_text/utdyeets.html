                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of constantly despairing over missing those intriguing clubs events and their free pizza, because of losing posters, finding out too late, etc; we decided to try create an easy and convenient method for students to crowdsource  and populate a map where they can post a picture of an event as they see it with an image and location tag, which other students can then see in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It implements a Google Maps interface showing the University campus along with the real-time location of the user, after a University email-based login to ensure authenticity of its user base. The user has the option of opening their camera and posting a picture of an event, or by default, scrolling through the map and viewing other people's posted events to see if any interests them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made use of MITs App Inventor Code Block system to help create an iOS App which made use of a spreadsheet database to constantly store and update the Event locations and details, from which, we output event markers onto the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While initially trying to implement our idea in Android Studio, we came across many IDE challenges which we managed to avoid by using App Inventor to create a basic implementation of it. But while using it, the bare simplicity cut down how much we could do with our application, as we had initially planned on incorporating a trained Google Assistant model to search for the nearest located free item of the type the user wants (say food, or stationary, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement a functional model of our idea and generate a database for storing the different locations and inputs that different users would input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn mobile app development from scratch and implement a Google Maps API, along with creating multiple screens to incorporate a social space.
                </p>
