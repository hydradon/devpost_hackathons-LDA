                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a fun, interactive game to play against Alexa

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play either scored or never ending games against Alexa.  You choose a category, such as foods, animals, U.S. cities, movies, actors or sports teams.  You then go back and forth - Alexa will say a word/phrase in the category and your word/phrase must start with any of the letters in Alexa's answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use AWS Lamda .Net Core project that uses DynamoDB for any needed persistent user data.
For the category content used to match against, I needed to come up with as complete of lists as possible and so that took some time compiling the lists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed to come up with a reliable way to handle plural and singular variations without needing to explicitly have every permutation in my lists.  Also matching movies, I needed to handle punctuation, special characters, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to handle the user just saying any word or phrase and getting that mapped to the right intent/slot
Also, developing a system crowd-source any missing items - so a system to capture not found items and allow for easy addition of valid items into the category lists to constantly improve the lists completeness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That to really understand how users are playing the game, I needed to store the path they took through the application during their sessions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Letter Chase
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would like to make a version that incorporates Echo Buttons, so that you can have a local multiplayer game and users try to "buzz in" first to give an answer.
