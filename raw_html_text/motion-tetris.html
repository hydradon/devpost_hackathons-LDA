                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game but also wanted to utilize interesting hardware for the controls. Idea for Tetris came from the gameplay being well known and we thought we could implement intuitive motion controls for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays a game of Tetris where instead of using the keyboard as the controller, infrared sensors track the motion of your hand. You move your hand left and right to move the Tetris piece left and right and raise your hand up to rotate the piece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using java and the Leap Motion SDK. The infrared sensor views the players hand on an x, y, z plane, and we used the position and velocity vector of the players hand to translate to Tetris controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion scanner collects up to around 115 frames per second, which is faster than needed and desired for Tetris controls. We ran into the issue of an instruction being complete too many times because of the number of times a similar frame was viewed. We fixed this by creating a buffer to make sure many frames are similar before completing the action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a usable game environment and implementing infrared controls within it. We are also proud of dealing with the frame rate buffer issue as it was a problem that was game breaking before fixed.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with an alternative to the general mouse and keyboard computer input. Also learned how to create a game space.
                </p>

                    What's next for Motion Tetris
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to possibly make different classic games such as Galiga, Duck Hunt, Brick Breaker, and Pong using motion controls.
