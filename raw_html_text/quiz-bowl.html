                    What it does Out of multiple categories, the user could pick which set of questions they decided to answer, but some topics didn't fit

                    How we built it We used Java through JGrasp

                    Challenges we ran into While trying to re-run a program with a while loop, we ran into the error of not running the second time through the loop.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We were able to get at least one topic to work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned To re-run a program doesn't require multiple while loops, but it is better to use do-while loops.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Quiz Bowl To complete the actual game, so that the user will have the free will to choose any topic to answer and get a decent practice out of the program.
