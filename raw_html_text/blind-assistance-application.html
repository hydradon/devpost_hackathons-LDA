                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the idea this winter when I noticed that many pedestrian audio signals do not work properly and even if they work the sound sometimes cannot be heard due to traffic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application uses the camera to detect pedestrians. signals and the mobile says"GO" or "STOP" depending on the signal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I trained the algorithm using photos of pedestrian signals that I took in the street  and  used the prediction API to build the app.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use computer vision software and android studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for Blind Assistance Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use more datasets of pedestrians signals photos to make the program more accurate.
