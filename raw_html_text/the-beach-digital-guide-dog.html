                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of BeachHacks 2018, we wanted to develop an app that could assist fellow 49ers who are visually impaired. As engineers we are constantly finding ways to make a difference and what better way than making a positive impact in our CSULB family.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking advantage of smartphone hardware, we utilize the GPS chip to gather longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates from the orbiting NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS).

                    A predefine library is defined, consisting of routes to buildings (VEC, CBA, LA5, etc.) from a centralized hub, the University Student Union (USU). These routes have been determined to be the safe and organized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application is audio enabled, allowing the user to interact with the application with ease. The user is asked to state the building they wish to go to and confirms the location prior to directing the user.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a sud code, flow chart, draft, python code, second draft, etc

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the audio drivers within virtual box did not work and CSULB wifi network did not allow allow us to connect phone to computer and transfer predefined GPS info of the routes
