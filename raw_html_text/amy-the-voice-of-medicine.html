                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the next frontier in human-technology interfaces, voice-enabled and voice-first technologies are leading the way in many innovative applications across industries. Predictions that 50 percent of searches will be voice-based by 2020 and that 55 percent of US households will have a smart speaker by 2022 have entrepreneurs, developers, product managers, and marketers rushing to figure out how they can capture the upcoming surge of voice-based technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AMY is smart medical assistant, it is a web and Google cloud based platform with IoT components. The hardware and software work in conjunction to provide the medical practitioner with accurate transcription and formating of their paperwork and provide data models that can be used by the medical professionals. Also all the people of interest receive the format and a notification via a serverless Qualcomm device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Qualcomm Dragonboard as a server to sent the MQTT data and developed a Python script that runs the Cloud Speech API by Google Cloud to create a medical conversation and fill a spreadsheet with relevant information pertaining forms. Then the form is transcribed to PDF and sent via email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform was very challenging to develop and the sync between the spreadsheets and the formats also.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met every goal and developed a functional prototype in very little time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not every advancement in Medicine has to be directed fully just to solve a probem in medicine but a lot is gained by helping the people that work in the industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AMY: The voice of medicine.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky is the limit as we can expand its probabilities with domotics integrations, image recognition and consumer focused versions of it.
