                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The one thing that behavioural therapists work with, more than anything else, is data, and lots of it. The data is always recorded by hand, and kept in huge binders. When faced with years' worth of information hidden in stacks and stacks of paper, therapists often struggle to come to firm conclusions on the most effective ways to treat a patient. Our goal is to create a tool that helps therapists be more productive in the workplace, and to help them create more valuable methods for treating a child, helping the child develop, and reducing the amount of time and money the families and children must invest.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Psyconnect allows therapists to schedule, plan, execute, and analyze appointments in one place. Therapists can book an appointment for a child on a specific date, plan out the different tasks they wish to complete with the child, use the app during appointments to record observations, and finally analyze the data they record.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile app was created with C#, .NET and Xamarin. We also used the Syncfusion Charts library to create graphs in Xamarin. Relational Database was made in Node.JS and MySQL.
