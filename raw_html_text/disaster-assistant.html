                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the IBM workshop, our team heard the robust tools that IBM Cloud had to offer. We were drawn to two specific tools: IBM-Cloud and IBM-Node Red. Using these two tools, we wanted to come up with some way to help the communities affected by the Natural Disaster. Thus, we decided to use a chat-bot that would be able to respond to the needs of the immediate victims.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When victims need the location of the nearest facility (hospital, etc.) or instructions on what they should do, Disaster Assistant will be able to identify the needs of the victims.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using IBM-Cloud, IBM- Node Red and html, css, and js.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Familiarizing ourselves with IBM API and express.

                <p>
                    Creating a chat-bot that's smart.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start much earlier and focus on completing small goals.

                    What's next for Disaster Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having first responders to these natural disasters be able to see the needs of the victims.
