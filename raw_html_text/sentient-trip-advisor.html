                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user only needs to provide a sentence in natural language. Let's say: "I want to go to camping near the beach." By using IBM Watson NPL, Assistant, Google API, and Expedia API, we discover the list of places for the user then the user can easily select the most interesting place that they would like to go. Then we show all the information needed to reach that place including: Flight, Stay, Things to do and Car Rental.

                <p>
                    We are using

                    <li>
                        Python for the backend 
We built two API wrappers on top of:

                        IBM Watson NPL

                    <li>
                        We had a number of ideas for this app but we had limited time to completely develop them all. We are sure that we will enhance the app in the near future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had some struggles in exploring the IBM Watson API, but with the whole team we finally figured it out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some Expedia APIs returned XML data which we needed to be converted into JSON.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are some limitation with the APIs
                    </li>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked as a team and finished end to end flow for some functionalities on time.
As a team each member had responsibilities that assisted in the completion of the app

                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new technologies and had the chance to do hand on experience with Natural Language Processing and Big Data Analytics.
