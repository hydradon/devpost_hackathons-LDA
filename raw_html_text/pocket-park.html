                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parking is inconvenient and an expensive hassle in Miami, so we came up with a solution that will alleviate this daily stress for drivers as well as provide residents and local businesses beneficial profit from their unused parking spots.

                <p>
                    This web application allows users to rent out vacant parking spaces at an hourly rate of their choice. Logged in users can then view available parking spots within their current location. These users are able to choose available spots on google maps and submit a payment on their credit card to reserve their spot.

                <p>
                    We designed the entire app to be a Single Page Application that communicates asynchronously with our back-end and external APIs, which makes this communication feel very fast and responsive for the user. The UX is also intuitive and very simple for navigating across the app and  conducting transactions.

                    We realized the importance of reinforcing organization by breaking down large issues into smaller components and delegating according to the strengths of each teammate to work efficiently.
