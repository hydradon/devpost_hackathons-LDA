                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many other groups, we faced our first challenge the minute our team arrived at YHack : What should our project be? We thought that it would be a great idea to visit the many panels hosted by some of the event's sponsors for some inspiration. It paid off fairly quickly when we noticed how much effort was given by each company in trying to make the world a better place. However, our first thought was how would people appreciate all these efforts if they weren't aware of any of the issues around the world? That's how our idea became related to raising awareness for current world news topics. We wanted to create a way for people to see what was going on around the world, and feel like there was a way for them to help. A major concern we had with this idea was that although people love to help others, it is often difficult to motivate them into doing so. Therefore, with the concept of instant gratification in mind, we decided our project would be getting people to play simple games, that in-between levels, raised awareness of current topics. Each game would match to individual charities that are centred around current topics, and progression in a game would result in money being donated to charities by companies willing to sponsor the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned the main page of the application to have a list of different current topics that we considered relevant to various ethical concerns. The user selects a topic from the list and begins playing a game. Once the level is completed, the player is prompted with a few lines of information related to the selected topic. The player must then answer one or two questions in order to proceed to the next level of the game. As the player progresses through the levels, the amount donated to charity increases, and so does the player's awareness of the selected topic!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, due to the sheer amount of participants at this years YHack, the internet speed was not at its full potential. This lead to issues downloading software and therefore delayed the commencement of our project. Another major challenge for our team was coding using Swift. Creating games is a great idea, but becomes very challenging, very quickly when the entire team needs to learn a new language in a matter of hours!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we might not have managed to grace the world with our technological masterpiece of flash player styled gameplay, we still got through our first Hackathon as a team and managed to survive sleep deprevation and several mental breakdowns through the power of friendship and caffeine.
