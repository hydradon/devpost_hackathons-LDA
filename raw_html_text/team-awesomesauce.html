                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MIRROR App will give patients easy- to- use age and gender appropriate screening mental-health related assessments (depression, bullying, drug abuse, etc.) that they can fill out while waiting for their physician. Once the assessments are filled out the physician will receive the scores and based on those scores the physician can now determine which area(s) in mental health that the patient needs intervention for and use that as an opportunity to communicate with the patient about them in addition to their physical health concerns at the same appointment. In addition, the physician and patient will receive recommendations to the community health clinics and professionals that are in close proximity to patient's residence that physicians and write referrals for on the patient's behalf.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the interdisciplinary approach to effectively address mental health awareness making the physicians and community organizations and professionals equal partners in helping to resolve it. Also proud of creating an app that helps streamline physician and patient awareness of mental health both with the individual patient and potential trends in the community where this app would be used.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that in addition to using technology to solve healthcare problems, we could use it to prevent to the potential of complications related to mental health (suicide, homicide, substance abuse) and in doing so empowering both the patient and the physician in treating any mental health problems detected.
