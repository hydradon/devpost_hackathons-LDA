                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we listen to songs without paying attention to occurence of certain words in the song, and sometimes the word that appears the most often really describes the song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to present the occurence of repetitive words in a graph and have fun with some guessing game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JS library (React), firebase, firestore and make a website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most challenging thing is dealing with how the website will look and data conversions so that the chart can read the data and firestore can save the data.

                <p>
                    Being able to make and retrieve data from the database.
