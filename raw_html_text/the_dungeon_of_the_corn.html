                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our game was the video game: The Binding of Isaac. We enjoyed playing that type of game and wanted to create our own version of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows a person to explore through a dungeon while fighting off monsters to survive. Our game is challenging for new players and fun to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project by drawing our own sprites in Photoshop, then animating the sprites in Unity to look fluid with movement. Then, we made transitions between the animations and wrote C# scripts to make the game runnable and have mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The animation of the weapon was very difficult, as it needed to have its own hitbox in order to kill the monsters. Also, learning how to use Unity and C# without any prior knowledge was challenging. Lastly, getting the collision correct took a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we learned how to use Unity very well and can write code in C# now. Also, we have a runnable game that we can progress in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make sprites, animate them, and display them and their movements on a screen.

                    What's next for The_Dungeon_Of_The_Corn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue progressing our game in our spare time in the hopes of making it a popular Steam game.
