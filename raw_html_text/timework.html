                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Timework Team is a group of young programmers at Jefferson Highschool with aspiring ideas for helping students and others to manage their time easier and efficiently with simple algorithms and a simple user interface. 
The team got their inspiration from attending the HackTJ 2018 hackathon and hopes to continue their project in the future

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automatic Scheduling
Having trouble managing your time? Our app helps with not only time management but also anti-procrastination. All you have to do is input the name of the task, the amount of time you will take to complete it, when it is due, and where it is occuring. And as you recieve more assignments this app will create a default schedule for you and when you should complete each task. You can easily customize this schedule and set reminders for when you should complete each task. If this schedule is followed you will never have to worry about time management or procrastinating again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notifications
Timework notifies you when an assignment is almost due. You can customize times for when you want to receive notifications. You can also receive these notifications through the app or through the conversational UI, Tim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conversational UI
If you have any issues then timework has its own virtual assistant that can help you troubleshoot your problems. In addition to this, other having to go through the app to input the tasks at hand, you can also just input them through Tim, the conversational UI through Google Assistant.
