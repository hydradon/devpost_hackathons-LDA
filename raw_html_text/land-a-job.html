                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years of my career development, there have many times when I or someone else felt like they had not been progressing towards their goals. Often time this will lead to apathy or worse depression. This effect will only compound over time with leading to unsatisfactory outcomes for all parties involved. We have thus set out to make a change and help users reach their professional goals and dreams.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application will allow the user to log in, and manage their career path and set career goals. The app will make it simple for a user to input their job, compare the skills of that job versus the skills of their next desired job. In the apps current iteration, the goal would be to allow the software to integrate directly with companies internal services to help the user better find and utilize these resources. We would help employees and managers to offer specific roles across their organization that they may be able to help out with to gain valuable experiences.
