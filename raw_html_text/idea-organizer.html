                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was brainstorming webs and being able to easily create and manipulate said webs in a digital form. This could allow for developing other things or in educational purposes or creative purposes or anything where one would like to organize and show connections between ideas.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Idea Organizer can create and store idea bubbles and the connections between them. It also saves the positions of the idea bubbles on a 2D plane which it can then draw. The goal is to be able to easily create, edit, and move these bubbles and their connections. Then one can save their drawn out ideas and connections to refer back to at a later date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first agreed on a design for how we wanted to store our data. We came up with ADTs for the classes we aimed to use to represent various different kinds of data like idea bubbles and connections between idea bubbles. Using this, we then were able to split up to begin working on different parts of the program. We split up so that we had someone on file IO, someone on implementing the data structures and other features, and someone on designing a UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we finished our tasks we moved onto helping the others complete their tasks or bringing everything together.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few times we came across the realization that we had not done our design well. We had to go back and change parts of our design a few times. Another challenge was ensuring everything was able to communicate with everything else properly.

                    Being able to read and write data to and from text files properly to create the necessary data objects for our project

                    Working together simultaneously on a project with the help of ADTs.

                    What's next for Idea Organizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more features such as different kinds of connections between idea bubbles, scrolling or zooming on ideas mapped out, more features to distinguish and create different kinds of idea bubbles as needed etc.
