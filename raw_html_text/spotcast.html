                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to expand the domain of what Spotify currently provides to its user, and we decided to use 'which songs are being heard by who at which place'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we know, the music of an area contributes to its general atmosphere and ambiance; the use case we have envisioned for our app is that it will provide public places (such as bars, cafes, restaurants etc.) the platform and the ability to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app shows a map with local users and their spotcasted playlists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Spotify Web API to get user's Spotify data. Our app starts with logging-in the user with their Spotify credentials. We used the phone's location feature to allow them to SpotCast a playlist of their choice and this get's pushed to our backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend stores the user's SpotCast in an SQL table. This table is the basis for all SpotCasts on our map (which is loadable for each user in-sync).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To integrate Spotify's API with Google Maps API in a clean and scalable manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved our target for a Minimal Viable Product. Moreover, the idea we came up with was backed enthusiastically by every team member and everyone could see it's real world use-cases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to setup an AWS server for our Flask API. In addition, we learned how to integrate location based data into existing tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpotCast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app we built has a number of possible extensions, such as more interactive collaborative queues, localized trend analysis and a step towards creating a more open and social music-sharing platform.
