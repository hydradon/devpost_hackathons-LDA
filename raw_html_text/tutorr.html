                    For some, it may be hard to find study partners, thus leading them to study alone, whereas others find study partners with ease. This application will help bring balance to that problem, and connect everyone within a college campus together.

                <h2>
                    The first iteration of this application, which is the current one, is only limited to college students within a campus. Students who have mastered a subject will be able to have to opportunity to teach others to solidify and justify their mastery, while also earning money. Students who are struggling with a certain subject can hire other students to tutor them. Through the app, students can sign up as a tutor or a tutoree. Tutorees will be limited in their choices of subjects by the subjects offered by the tutors within their university. Payment will happen through the application.

                    In further iterations, Tutorr will expand outside of the universities to provide tutoring and teaching services to everyone. Eventually, the application may start offering 'microdegrees' which can provide as a viable option for people who cannot afford universities, but still want to learn a pathway without unnecessary elective classes.
