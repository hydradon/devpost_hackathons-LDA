                    Executive Summary -
                </p>
                <p>
                    The &ldquo;Bobcats&rdquo; team has conceptualized a software application that would be capable of ensuring safety among farmworkers and supervisors to mitigate any injury or health risks. Bobcats have decided to solve this problem by integrating a light weight hardware device, such as a watch, and database system to collect data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FarmWatch is a product that allows Crew Leaders to live monitor the health of their farmworkers to prevent any major health risks. Unlike any other software, FarmWatch by Bobcats will benefit every party from Farmworker to OSHA personnel. In addition, FarmWatch is user-friendly and &ldquo;language free&rdquo;.

                <p>
                    After analyzing the given information and extensive discussion, the following needs were identified, which will be resolved by FarmWatch:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; Notification of Breaks &ndash; ensure consistency and productivity 
&bull; Literacy &ndash; make it universal so that anyone can understand the messages. 
&bull; Comfort &ndash; light weight and adaptable product 
&bull; Confidence &ndash; ensure privacy and confidence to farmworker 
&bull; Ergonomics &ndash; positioning training to reduce physical injury
                </p>
                <p>
                    Design -
                </p>
                <p>
                    The product will be a watch. The implemented software will track heart rate, body temperature, and alert the farmworker of mandatory breaks. Having this data collected from the watch itself, it will ensure that the farmworker is notified when his/her body temperature and/or heart rate rises above normal and suggest them to take an unscheduled break. In addition, they will be notified of the breaks mandated by OSHA. The ergonomics of every task will have to be analyzed and create a schedule to set up stretch breaks after a designated amount of time to prevent physical injury. The interface of the watch will have minimal to no alphabetic language. Instead we have opted to use images that speak for themselves in order to address language barriers and literacy levels. In addition to this, the farmworker will have the option of verbally contacting their supervisor via the watch in the event that an emergency arises.
                </p>

                    Stakeholder - 
&bull; OSHA: They will benefit because they will ensure that the farmworkers will be in good standing in policies and rules. 
&bull; Farm owners: They will benefit by being able to access the data base which will allow them to make better assumptions to prevent injuries among their workers. 
&bull; Crew Leaders: They will benefit by digitizing data to make their own judgment to prevent injuries instead of having leaders go out to every farmworker. 
&bull; Farmworkers: They will benefit from the monthly injury/drug prevention session implemented, to educate the farmworkers.
