                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were sitting around one night and thought there should be an augmented reality ruler that gives measurements in binary values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ruler gives real world dimensions using your iPhone's built in camera, it then calculates the difference between those points in 3D space to give approximate measurements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using xCode 9 and running on iOS 11. We used the ARSCNView class to blend 3D content with real world images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have a mutual familiarity with programming in Swift, and some group learning ensued as a result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle and display these values in metric and binary
We created an application that accurately measures real world  dimensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our differences in knowledge with Swift gave us the opportunity to learn from each other and work together to accomplish the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for binaryTape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand on this idea and create user options to calculate both volume and various other measurements in 3D space. Ideally the user could select the shape to be measured and the units to be displayed. We hope to refine the application and allow users to share their measurements via social media by using services such as the twitter API.
