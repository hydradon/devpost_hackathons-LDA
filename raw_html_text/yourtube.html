                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When in Rome! The YouTube HQ Cafeteria is a surprisingly fun place to work and a great inspiration! We really wanted to try something we never worked with before- site APIs. This visualizer would be a good mix of new skills and design experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was particularly inspired by a close friend who is also a big content creator on YouTube. I really wanted to try my hand at making a cool visualization like he did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to have a Chrome Extension that allowed you to quickly and easily see how your latest submitted videos were doing. It would track view count, comments, favorites, and likes to make a visualization of how your latest video is doing in comparison to your other videos. Easy, simple, and useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API calls are in Python, and the visualization is done in Java using processing software. A valiant effort was made to use Javascript to put it into a chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really ran out of time and skill on the Chrome Extension part. Parsing the data recieved form the API calls was also difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also running out of time to submit!!!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Getting the bulk of it to work! Especially the API part!
