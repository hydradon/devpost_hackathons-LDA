                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide students like us an opportunity to get involved in the computer programming scene at an early age.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackCore links hackers who need experience and people who need projects done. Users can upload their Github portfolios and/or resumes to appeal to people with higher demands. Overall, HackCore helps the community by providing free computer work to leaders and free experience to students, or anyone using the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this iOS app with Swift and Xcode, along with a Django back-end. Two of us worked on the back-end while two of us worked on the iOS front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was the difficulty of merging front-end and back-end. The two of us who were working on the front-end were not very experienced in calling APIs and JSON, but several YouTube videos later, we were on our way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of successfully finishing a good looking, functional app for our first ever Hackathon. As freshmen, we didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be really fun and a great learning experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine an iOS front-end with a Django Back-end.
We learned how to code with a deadline.
Most importantly, we learned how to solve problems as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackCore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may continue testing and working on HackCore and release it to the public, hopefully helping students like us.
