                        We recognize that it is oftentimes hard to pick up a new language especially when you don't have anyone to practice with. As such, we wanted to develop an idea for our app: to provide you a perfect fluent speaker to help you learn any language you wish. We also noticed that in many bilingual households children often held full conversations with their parents in English, and thought that perhaps it was a good segue for new language learners to comfortably transition into their target language.

                    <li>
                        When you want to learn a new language, at the start it is easier to listen to responses in the foreign language to acclimate to their vocabulary and vernacular. Since you don't know much of the language, you may want to start by speaking a language you are comfortable with while conversing with an AI which speaks in the language you wish to learn. The transcript of the AI's response allows you to see the response in both your language and your target language (like subtitles), allowing you to gain a better grasp of the language--so that you too can speak it! As you get better, you can switch over to speaking your target language as well. Pressing "start" lets you start recording, and the conversation goes from there. All responses will be shown with your spoken language and the target language. Pressing "stop" afterwards will end the current conversation and let you start a new conversation with new language parameters.
