                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food. Who doesn't love it. It's the most essential part of life. Some people say water is life, others say love, but they are all wrong. Food is love, food is water, food is life. And when you can meet new people, find new sources of water, and eat great food, that is how you truly know you are living life.

                    Our app Potluck connects people who want to cook similar meals together. It allows you to see what other people are cooking and let them know you are coming. The result? Amazing food with amazing new friends.

                    No one on our team knew any Swift coming into this. Nevertheless, we coalesced and built a mindblowing application. Challenges? Only obstacles, hurdles we jumped and overcame.
