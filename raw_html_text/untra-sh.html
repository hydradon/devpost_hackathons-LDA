                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know there are hundreds of innovative reuse services out there- we saw some on Friday and some of you are working on them right now. But we also know that tons of people have no idea these exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We link the consumer to hundreds of fantastic services out there, so you know what to do with your waste, or figure out a way to make treasure from waste. For every donation or creation you make, you earn points. Verified by a unique ID given to the consumer and collector, we track every exchange and give out rewards. 
For the points you earn, you get a neighborhood deal or favor from one of our partners.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From scratch with html 5, css3, php and javascript.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding data on this scale, to list every product and service out there. We will rely on our  network of reuse innovators (non profits, start ups, ideators, small businesses) for the most up to date data on the services and products they offer. In fact, it is in their business' benefit to keep their information up to date.We extensively rate and rank the crowd-sourced ideas we collect.

                    SO MUCH TO ACHIEVE
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waste reuse is not just about awareness, it is also making reuse convenient and sexy to consumers and influence long term behavior patterns. The best way to achieve this is through an incentive system - we intend to use a point system for our users.

                <p>
                    It becomes a mobile app! Point your phone, scan your trash and it'll tell you how to reuse, repurpose or sell it; It tells you how to make the most of the points you earn from the app; It executes reuse, repurpose or a sale instantly!
