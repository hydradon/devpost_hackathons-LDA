                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know people that are really great at using a computer- if the computer is from the 80's and doesn't have a GUI. However, it is important to introduce these people to such new technologies as SMS and even image messaging. What better tool to introduce them to instant messaging than version control software that they already use?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program lets you send and receive SMS and MMS messages using git. You can create a file with the phone number and enter one line per message. When you commit and push, any new messages are then sent to their respective phones. People can reply to the messages and you git pull to check for new messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There is a hook in the server's git repository that checks for any new messages whenever someone pushes to it. It then sends the messages with the Twilio API.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There is a webserver built in Flask that listens for new SMS/MMS messages and commits them to the git repository as they come in.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the libraries for using git in python have incomplete documentation when it comes to finding the exact changes in a diff.
