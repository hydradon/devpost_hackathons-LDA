                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In urban areas, the sense of community is lacking. We wanted to increase participation and interaction in urban communities, and foster a sense of belonging. We aim to connect people by helping them help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter TasCart, which was created in 2016 as a tool to foster genuine connections between members of a community, specifically in large urban centers. The nature of our living structure has isolated us to a point where neighbors often don&rsquo;t know each other&rsquo;s names. TasCart responds to this problem by encouraging members of a community to help each other in small but meaningful ways.  Designed as a network to connect people who need help with those who can provide help, the service provided is an online facilitated forum where users can post requests for small tasks--for example, picking up some extra items when grocery shopping--which is accepted for either negotiated prices, pro bono, or community service hour allocations. Overall, TasCart is a powerful tool for meeting those around us and finding serendipity in the small stuff in life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database component of TasCart was made using Express.js and MongoDB in conjunction with jQuery to allow for basic interactions with the database.  A static version of the site (protoype) was also created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members have ever participated in a Hackathon before, and all of us could be considered fairly new to code.  None of us had experience with back-end web development either, meaning that we had to learn almost everything from scratch.  As each team member was located in a different city, it was difficult to co-ordinate many aspects of the project, not two mention that two of our team members had final exams running during the Hackathon and another had prom.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we all had very little experience coming in and there were many bumps in the road, we are proud of what we managed to accomplish during the two days--including a business plan.  Each of us learned a lot from this experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some of the basics of Mongo, Express, and Node.  All of us approached subjects that we were previously unfamiliar with, which also includes HTML, CSS, and graphic design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TasCart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a fully-featured mobile application to make the program more accessible when out and about. 
Task validation will be improved and more safety/security concerns will be addressed.
