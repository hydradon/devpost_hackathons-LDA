                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons often find people consuming large amounts of caffeine, and with an API that could help determine a persons metabolic rate and optimal levels of caffeine and productivity, we decided that we could make an app that could do just that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks caffeine decay in the body, and lets users know the optimal time to recaffeinate when levels are about to drop below recommended levels for maximum productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of Java with Android Studio to combine the backend Java with a Java based Android front end, and combined SQLite and and Android activities to provide a long lasting user profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial attempts to code the backend was confusing with attempts to use Python, then integrate said Python into the Android app, and left us with hours of unusable work and us attempting to rewrite codes and API calls so that we could have access to the Awakens API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that as a two man team we were able to complete an app with full functionality and API integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should attempt to fix errors early before they get out of hand, and that we should attempt to get help sooner rather than later.
