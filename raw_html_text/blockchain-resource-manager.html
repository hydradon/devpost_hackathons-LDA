                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to enable donators to be able to track their donations and provide a system for organizations to manage their donations and locations. We believe that with this system, the distribution of supplies will be optimized and victims can receive help faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses block chain technology to track donations, their contents, and location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Hyperledger Composer built on top of a Kubernetes cluster to handle the specifics of the blockchain protocol and specify unique forms of transactions and assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal coming into this hackathon was to experiment with technology that we understand conceptually but have never put into practice. As a result, none of us had practical experience with blockchain or web development so every step of developing this project was a learning process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the lack of experience, we accomplished our goal of learning and playing around with new technology and creating this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a basic blockchain and how to use Hyperledger Composer and Node Red.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blockchain Resource Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given our limited time, we could only create a proof of concept and only utilized a fraction of Hyperledger Composer's potential. Future features include a confirmation of receipt from warehouses potentially using DocuSign, searching for specific orders, and overall optimization of our protocol.
