                    We,ve always been told to write down our goal on paper, but we often find that those things become difficult to fit into your daily routine and also how to keep motivating yourself. Then we thought of an app that incoparetes goals into your calender. However the unique selling point is our wager system. We thought if you had to put money towards your goal and to earn it back you would have to complete your tasks.

                <p>
                    The app allows you to set goals and pug into other third party apps that ou already use to track goals, in order to track them all in one place. It also implements a wager system to engage the user in increased accountability, whereby you put down cash and to get it back you complete all your tasks. It comes down to investing in yourself, the app also has a functionality where by you can challeng your friends to friendly and competitive wagers. The app gives you regular updates on your current objectives and your percentage completion.

                    Using the marvel app prototype, we built a demo app which we look to build upon. We also developed a basic web page using html5, javascript and css. We also tested the process of setting a goal in mutiple areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Narrowing down the functionality of the app, we had let go of people,ideas and dreams. Due to lack of cumunication we weren't able host the website. We had to remove some parts of the app e.g. negative ratings as we believed this could lead to cyber bullying.It is a very coherent idea, the loyal members of the team stuck it through. It is a sensible,practical and a new idea that can fill a need in the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to delegate and filiter through ideas and roles. Also key points in web development and the various ways and systems in which to build them. We expect to increase and improve functionality, and to build a working prototype by october. So stay tuned and stay qweng.
