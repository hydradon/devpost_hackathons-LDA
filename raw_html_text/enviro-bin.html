                    We got inspired by the lack of motivation household participation in local recycling programs. Many households have the ability to participate in curbside recycling and all have the ability to drop off recycling at a local recycling collection center. We thought if we provide a financial incentive or some form of gamification we could encourage users to recycle . We believe the government will assist us in this as in the long run it makes their jobs easier and costs them less money than large scale clean ups.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes pictures of garbage. Recognizes objects which  are garbage, classifies it and gives users instructions on how to safely dispose or recycle the garbage and gives rewards for participating. The app also gives users the option of uploading to snapchat with captions and filters showing they recycled.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built  the app by using building an app and integrating various pieces together. We used various API's to help the app run smoothly such as Snapchat and Google Vision and camera kit.  When we got all the necessary data we wrote the logic to classify this data with Toronto's waste database and pass back instructions to our users

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google vision Api for the first time and properly identified objects. We also spent a great deal of time on the snap chat api so we were  happy we got that to work.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about android studio and how to develop for android devices, we also significantly improved our debugging skills as android sdk came with a lot of problems , We had to refresh our memory of git and use proper version control as all four of us worked on different components and had to stay synced with each other.

                    Partner with government for rewards system and have them also respond to pings from our app to pick up major garbage in location.
