                    The Idea/Problem:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a serious plague that has spread throughout the world (whoever is reading this might suffer from it!) The pathogen I am discussing is a lack in confidence and belief in oneself. As Jack Zenger stated, confidence proves to be equally as valuable as competence because it leads to action, attention and resilience. He discusses the
                    <em>
                        Imposter Syndrome
                    </em>
                    , where women frequently express that they don't feel they deserve their jobs and are "imposters" who could be found at any moment. A Hewlett Packard report found that men apply for a job/promotion then they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meeting 100% of them. As women's experience increases over time, so does their confidence. Self confidence is what you think of yourself, self-esteem is what others think of you. With our product we hope to improve a user's self-confidence with their maintenance of skills and abilities.

                    Market Research
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognized that our product is similar to Khan Academy (as well as other educational resources such as EdX and Coursea) because we are producing educational content targeted towards high schoolers and college students. However, our competitors do not emphasize the idea of continuous education, as they target students enrolled in a  course to learn topics for short-term memory. Our product seeks to have the user continually develop their skill in order for lasting remembrance, which would be refreshed by a weekly quiz. We also have a social-platform part of our app where there is user-to-user interaction through mini-battles to incentivize gaining points for their avatars. These re attributes that makes our product unique and more practical than others on the market.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the web framework Angular version 7 to architect the front, with Angular Material for the UI/UX. We also used Firebase for the user auth and database.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted our app to look great and we ended up running into a few issues with the CSS animations and styling the Landing Page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're proud of implementing a user-authentication with Firebase, further making our demo a better proof of concept and realistic UI/UX.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part of our project is dependent on users gaining points through visiting other websites (resources we provide the user) and practicing their skills on the other platforms. If we were to fully develop this as a viable product to seek investment, we would be worried about copyright infringement.

                    Future Updates:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to have illustrations of our own superhero for each of the six learning areas because currently, we are using the Marvel v. DC rivalry as a representation of the different skills of STEM v. Humanities. We would like illustrations for an original hero representing: Engineering, Math, Science, Foreign Language, Entrepreneurship and History.
