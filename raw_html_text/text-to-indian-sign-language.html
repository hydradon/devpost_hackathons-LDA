                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build something for people with hearing disability in India which represents a greater part of the population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It converts the English Text to Indian Sign Language enacted through videos and animations combining many words to form a sentence so that information is swiftly conveyed without
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a database of all the words for which sign language conversion was available and combined them to form a video displaying full sentence in a meaningful manner. We also used SigML that uses animations to display the sign language conversion of the text. The benefit of using SigML is it can break every word in a letter if the word is not found in the database.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ISL is not much developed, so it was hard to get information about it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making a service that helps people in their day to day activities involving communication with the outer world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that sign language is not universal around the world. Technically, this project helped us enhance our coding skills and helped us to learn working in a team giving us the idea of how to solve a real world problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text to Indian Sign Language
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This can be incorporated into many apps and services and those services can be made easily accessible to people with hearing disabilities that comprises a large part of the population.
