                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a TA, it is sometimes difficult to know who needs help and what order they have been waiting in; it is also annoying for students to have their hands raised while they wait. The solution to these problems is HelpTrain! Our website will make waiting for lab check offs easier and more fair than ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HelpTrain allows TAs to go in and start a queue at the beginning of their lab or office hours. Students are then able to join the queue that their TA has set up via a small 6 character password. TAs are able the view the current list of students waiting and clear the students they've helped. Students can go to the website to sign up for the queue and see who is waiting ahead of them. Gone are the days of tired arms in the air.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js and Express for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL was used for the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some troubles getting our databases set up initially but once we found a better installer, things went much more smoothly. We were also trying to setup Continuous Integration for easier deployment on the server throughout the project, and as the project grew we had to think of more edge cases such as including dependencies when fetching the latest build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, this was our first big JavaScript Project, and it was very fun to learn a new language. JavaScript proved to be a bit of challenge, but a welcome one. We learned a lot and enjoy the experience of learning some web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HelpTrain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a chat feature that allows users in the queue to answer the questions of other people in the queue. By doing this, people can decrease their wait time as well as helping out the their classmates.
