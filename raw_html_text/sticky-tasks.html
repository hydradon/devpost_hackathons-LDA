                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using classic sticky notes to remember many things. Also, after every weekend we were checking "My Open Issues" on JIRA to recall what do we have to do for this week. We thought it would be awesome to just look at the desktop and see everything about our issues, so we just combined JIRA Issues and sticky notes and created Sticky Tasks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Normally, to check the status of your issue you have to open your browser, log in to JIRA, select your filter or look for some gadget on your dashboard. Sticky Tasks allows you to save your time by placing your JIRA issues on your desktop in form of small sticky notes. When you expand them, you can see more details about your issue and even edit them, with no need to use web browser. You can also comment them and log your work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sticky Tasks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future versions we plan to add possibility to do any transition on your workflow, add attachment and linking support and many, many more!
