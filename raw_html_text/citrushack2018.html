                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An interest in incorporating music in algorithmic systems, and seeing what could be done using a machine to create something typically produced using human creativity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a randomly generated MIDI sequence that can be used in multiple music production applications. It allows the user to use limited customization options to tweak their MIDI sequence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python, and an additional python library from github, which was behind the brunt of the work required to convert python language to a MIDI sequence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was actually our first true experience working with python code, which made this a very informative experience for our group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn python with no prior experience in it and MIDI protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use object oriented design with python and reference MIDI protocol
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well that's a great question, but this has inspired us to do another hackathon in the future.
