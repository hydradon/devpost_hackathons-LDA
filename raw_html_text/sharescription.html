                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love leaching off other people's Netflix, but hate it when people do it to us. We wanted to solve the age old issue of sharing subscriptions. There's currently no real easy way to split the bills, as you have to rely on someone paying, and everyone else remembering to pay that person back. We aim to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can register via oAuth Facebook, and then add their bills using the simple web interface. They can then decide to share the bill with other people registered on the platform. Once a month, the service automatically splits the bill between everyone and sends an Interac e-Transfer request to everyone who's agreed to pay the bill. It then generates a one-time use virtual debit card number for them to use at the merchant the bill is for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is lots of different pieces all put together. Our APIs are coded in Node.js via Standard Library, we used Flask and Bootstrap to build our website, and bits of PHP to patch up our knowledge gaps. In terms of APIs, we used the Interac e-Transfer API, Marqeta API for generating card numbers.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        We had quite a few issues with API documentation (and the lack of it) and things not running quite as they should be.

Although all of us have experience with Python but learning how to use Flask for the first time was definitely a struggle for all of us. Secondly I had spent a fair amount of time trying to set up the virtual environment in order to get the project up and running."

There&rsquo;s a limited supply of documentation on the email parser (SendGrid), and I had to use 3rd party websites to understand how to deploy the app."

                        Oh my, there was a fair share of challenges, not only did we have to deal with the interact documentation, but even then the website tools rarely ever seemed to work. from there fate decided that the language of choice was going to be one I had not ever used before (node.js) but We still got it working in the end.

                        To be honest the fact that the proper output is coming out from a range of inputs is a real succes for me. to be honest my initial expectations were low, but as time progress, I found more to be proud of in my work. Something about specifically working with the Interac API and starting off with feelings of hopelessness, but then creating something makes it all the more better.

                <p>
                    We built the infrastructure for email parsing, but didn't get quite get around to implementing it as a feature. We'd love to make it so people can just forward their bills to the service and have them automatically appear, as this'd make it a lot easier to add new bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'd also like to add support for more subscriptions, and perhaps use machine learning to recognise new services and add them to the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of business, we think partnering with subscription services to show relevant targeted advertising or rewards/discounts to customers using the service would be a really good way to help monetise it.
