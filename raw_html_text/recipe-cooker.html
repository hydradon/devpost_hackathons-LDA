                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students, people who are short with time, stay-home mothers, anyone can use this site when in need of an idea for their meals! Take a photo (or scan barcodes of packaged food eventually) of the items in your fridge and get recipe recommendations from delicious food blogs and sites!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User uploads a picture of the ingredients in his/her fridge. Our server utilizes Microsoft's computer vision API and returns a string of tags analyzed from the photo.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using Amazon's S3 cloud, and python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ubuntu server, and connection to s3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a cloud storage and connecting APIs to our django project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out from scratch, only with this idea of recipe recommendations. We had hands-on experience with ubuntu/nginx server, Amazon's S3 cloud storage, form tags in html, the use of APIs with python, redirection or urls, and much more. 
We also learned how to jump straight into coding our idea from scratch. We've learned so much from our mentors who were more than eager to learn about our ideas and support us through the entire process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recipe Cooker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still in the process of developing, our goal is to parse and create an inventory of the items the user photographs or scans. We want to create references to the levels of carcinogen, calories, sugar, fiber, etc. and more food characteristics to eventually promote a healthier lifestyle. With the inventory created, we want to suggest the user recommendations of recipes that the he/she can cook with the food they have in their fridge! Later, we will also create a "Favourites" list and potentially link to online grocery stores and delivery services such as Peapod and Amazon. There is so much room for improving this website and perhaps also make a parallel mobile application!
