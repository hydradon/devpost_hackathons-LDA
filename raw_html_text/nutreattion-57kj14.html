                    How I built it
                </h2>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to use the studio, and with all tenacious efforts, one of our team member suffered from dormitory deficiency. In the end, we even had a plethora of difficulties when it came to inserting our vast project into the devpost void.
