                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the UF Facebook Ride Board, where people who were driving to a location asked if anyone else wanted to go that way and join them. We thought there was a better and more organized way to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows for users to create an account, and create rides, and users can also 'take a seat' in a ride, and help contribute gas money on the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML/CSS for the frontend, and SQL to manage databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning backend, working with databases, and using Python with HTML and web, along with SQL with relatively less experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Flask to work and allow for interaction and movement across pages, and saving user databases through HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python/Flask for backend was new for us and we all learned a lot about it, and its functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RideShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement third party APIs, such as for payments, Google Maps, calendar, SMS alerts for rides, etc. 
We also wanted to design a better frontend structure, since we focused a lot on learning backend infrastructure.
                </p>
