                    As college students living off campus, its easy for us to fall back on instant meals and snacks, and food from restaurants and fast food chains just do not provide the same nutrition as a nice home-cooked meal. However, preparing home-cooked meals is a challenge encountered on a daily basis, and grocery ingredients often expire before we even have a chance to look at them. This website gives college students like us the ability to plan meals based upon the ingredients they have available. For example, if you're aware of the ingredients will expire, you can generate recipe ideas from them, thereby reducing food wastage. The site will keep track of what ingredients you have, and the user can delete the items when they have used it up.  Each user can create an account that will remember the ingredients they currently have, preventing the user from forgetting about an item.
