                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the appropriate dining location has always been a big struggle for students, especially freshmen. Keeping this in mind, we wanted to build a revolutionary platform that connects the students to the eating options around campus. Campus services in the past have been a hassle to deal with for students, featuring schedules and menus on completely different sites. We decided to improve students' quality of life by bringing these two features together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we were really inspired by Google Cloud's services and its mission of data privacy and developer friendliness. We really wanted to push ourselves and try something new, so we wanted to work Google Cloud services into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It consists of a front end dashboard that takes in user input using the google-web speech API and calls Beautiful Soup to scrape dining hall websites and display the menu and hours of any location in one convenient location. Using the system's date, the program ensures that the menus and schedules displayed remain updated. It is globally deployed using Google Cloud, and the backend relies on a python script that scraps live data. The front end dashboard was developed using HTML and CSS.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major skill we learned from this project was the use of Google Cloud - be it deployment and hosting or implementing existing revolutionary algorithms to improve user experience. This combined with workshops and mentor help, we were able to gain an in-depth knowledge of Google Cloud.
                </p>

                    What's next for OkayOski
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve the identification accuracy of the speech to text algorithm and expand this to off-campus locations as well. Additionally, we hope to include more student services in one place, like links to CalCentral, Canvas, and the Berkeley laundry web. In addition, we plan to make major changes in the UI aspect and get rid of some unnecessary listings.
