                    King's Cup but no poker cards?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wanted to play a game of King's Cup during a fun night out with your buddies but forgot to bring a deck of cards? Fret not, King's Cup bot is here!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simple telegram bot allows users to play a game of King's Cup. We aimed to create a simple "Pass-And-Play" style with using only one phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this Telegram bot because we are always faced with the problem of not having a deck of cards or having to spend unnecessary money to buy a deck of cards to play a game of King's Cup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem we have faced is having to search for rules for the game as well as always having to refer to a phone for the rules. Therefore what we have done is that we have included rules.
