                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Urgent care wait times in Montreal hospitals can be lengthy and inefficient due to sub-optimal communication between EMS and Emergency Rooms.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LifeConnect streamlines the process for emergency responders to  gather information and make better, more informed decisions on hospital destination. LifeConnect links patient status information and location to hospital capacity, doctor availability, distances, and wait time. The desktop app notifies hospitals of incoming patients, and allows them to better prepare for patients who are

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed efficient algorithms to optimize the connectivity and workflow of the overall performance. Specifically, we used Android Studio to create and interface for paramedics to input information, then sort in a local cache using a serialiazable class.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given that we did not have a strong background in back-end development, we had difficulty storing information in databases and sending it to the desktop app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon provided a great learning opportunity for our team, and ultimately we are very proud of realizing our vision and creating a prototype to make healthcare systems more efficient, reduce costs, and improve patient care.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time that many of us attempted building a mobile app, so that in and of itself was a great learning opportunity. In addition, we learned how to manage our data, work together as a team, and use version control (BitBucket, GitKraken).

                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many features that we hope to include in future versions of LifeConnect. These include finalizing our server and our desktop app. We then hope to connect medical equipment machines, voice recognition, and
