                    Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together is 2-4 player co-op game where one player uses a Vive headset and three other's use mobile devices to solve puzzles. The three mobile players assist with identifying puzzles, setting waypoints and finding objects while the Vive player completes the puzzles. Each mobile player emits a certain color light where they are looking at, this light shows objects that only they can see. Once the player identifies these objects, the Vive player is able to interact with them. Asymmetrical puzzle game.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our experience, VR tends to be an isolated experience for the user. Not only that, but it tends to be expensive, often requiring consumers to buy a gaming PC as well. When approaching this, we wanted people to still be able to be part of the experience even if they don't have a VR headset, so instead they can join in on their phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together is a cooperative asymmetrical cross platform escape the room puzzle game. One player is in room scale VR while three other people are playing on their phones to see the same environment in AR. The VR player is the only one able to complete the puzzles, but the AR players are the only ones that can see the puzzles. So without using speech, they will need to communicate with each other through body language to solve the puzzles.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever worked with cross platform multiplayer before. None of us had ever built games or worked with AR for mobile devices.

                    We are going to continue working on it so that we can launch it!
