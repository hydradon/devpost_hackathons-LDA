                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friend Zone idea is inspired by my personal observation of the behavior of our society today. From my observation, I find that technology has taken over one of the core human principle, which is social interaction. In a general public place, people remain closed off and occupied with electronic devices, leaving no room for any social interactions to take place.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>This in the long run has made a lot of people including youths, more introverted in a new place of setting. For example, in the freshmen years of university/college, lot of students have hard time making friends and connecting with people because they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable getting out of their comfort zone.

                    We learned to work together effectively as a team.
We learnt a great deal about android studio and open source technologies. 
We were put under immense time pressure which forced us to manage our time well and stay focused on the task at hand.
