                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted a fun way to discover new music.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application will give users a nice variety of music that will match their mood. It is suppose to pair nicely such as 'happy' music going along with a happy mood and maybe a 'softer' tune for if you're sad.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using pure javascript and HTML. I used a framework called Frow, which is a CSS framework. This framework basically remedied a ton of problems that bootstrap has. It allows the user to make much more customizable forms and boxes without suffocating the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. One of the biggest problems is figuring out how the weather really ties into the mood. It's easy to tell that rainy weather is more likely to predict sadder music, but there isn't too much scientific evidence for that.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Finishing this application is an achievement. I didn't fully produce the product that I envisioned, but it is a fully functioning app.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use my first CSS framework. It was awesome because I have never dealt with this before.

                <p>
                    Machine learning! I definitely want a more customizable, personal experience for the user every time they use this app.
