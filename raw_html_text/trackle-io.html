                    This is a project designed to use opencv to track a users head, eyes and more specifically their irises to use them to control peripherals such as their mouse. Using various built in and proprietary algorithms the program tracks the movement of the irises and processing that manipulates the input.

                    trackle.io was created as a keyboard and mouse replacement for individuals with disabilities and restricted movement capabilities. 
One such condition is carpal tunnel which affects 8 million people yearly and trackle.io can be used as both a recovery and prevention tool. 
Along with that, it is a platform for enthusiasts looking for an alternative way to interact with their computers including gamers and students.
