                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote my senior thesis on online far right radicals and digital deplatforming. What I noticed while writing the thesis is that for this subsection of vulnerable men, the resources are awful. Pick up artists and toxic online communities prey on and radicalize these men while the rest of society shames them. The goal of this game is to get them before they hurt someone else.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dating sim aimed at building empathy and teaching these men how to talk to women in a healthy, respectful way.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ren'py, an engine for building visual novels. It uses basic python.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Just the basic learning code of building something.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic python.

                    This can be expanded into a full game with greater customization of the player character. Theoretically there could be other games similar to this one with other realistic settings.
