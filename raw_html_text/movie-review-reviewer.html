                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming as a first-timer to hackathon, I was bubbling with a ton of crazy ideas. I had concepts down in my mind for computerized wallets, beautiful virtual reality games and sound-changing technology that hadn't been developed before. The only issue was that I am a noob. I overestimated what I could possibly do, and that led to the reality check of me finding out I couldn't develop almost all of the things I wanted too. However, my artificial intelligence seminar flashed in my head and I thought it would be neat to try out something involving machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Python implementation of the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier" rel="nofollow">
                        <strong>
                            <em>
                                Naive Bayes classifier
                            </em>
                        </strong>
                    </a>
                    . The purpose of the classifier is that it will look at a block of text and analyze from what it knows about positive and negative words whether or not the block of text holds a positive or a negative message. It measures its own confidence level in how sure it is in its validity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The University of Pennsylvania developed a very well-known *
                    <em>
                        Natural Language Processing
                    </em>
                    toolkit for Python in 2001. It is known as
                    <a href="NLTK" rel="nofollow">
                        http://www.nltk.org
                    </a>
                    and it is widely used to develop bare functions involved with NLP. I worked around with some of the methods supplied by this library as well as creating my own to develop this. Originally it was a lot of trial-and-error; however, lots of reading later, things became simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not simply simple to develop something like this. Some believe you can just count the number of
                    <em>
                        positive words
                    </em>
                    and compare it directly to the number of
                    <em>
                        negative words
                    </em>
                    . This does not hold true however. Consider the phrase,
                    <em>
                        "he brilliantly succeeded at failing"
                    </em>
                    . The sentence is definitely negative; however, just simply counting specific words to determine if it was positive or negative would make the machine believe the sentence was positive.

                    </em>
                    simply because it took every single algorithm in the project [regardless of accuracy], took the best parts of all the algorithms, and merged everything into one classifier that gives the best result possible. All simply within a few lines of code:

                    I learned that NLP is definitely an incredibly bigger challenge to implement than I could have imagined. What I was able to do hardly even covers the basic necessities to properly
