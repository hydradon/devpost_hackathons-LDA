                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to advocate for women in technology by creating a story about a girl, Belle, who had to go through a lot of ups and downs but overall is able to overcome adversity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter data sets that were received from Bell are applied to a machine learning model to determine which of the tweets contained positive and negative information, and produces a graph output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us are new at coding so just producing something was pretty great. We also were able to produce a machine learning model to apply to the data we were provided by Bell which was a huge accomplishment. Learning html and using bootstrap was big too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to produce and apply a machine learning model, as well as how to use bootstrap and html
