                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the Netflix and Chill button and many nights where disorganization within our group of friends has shortened the amount of time we can have fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our button sends out a text blast to your closest friends and polls them on where everyone wants to got for the night, while simultaneously preparing an Uber and queuing up some tunes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Caffeine, Python, and a Raspberry PI, and a pretty cool button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial challenges we faced were issues with complying the correct  results from the polling software we are using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one lost their cool. Debugging was fairly simple. Fixing the polling software. Getting the button to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Python, and more Python. How to troubleshoot the button. How to send notifications through multi-platform channels.
                </p>
