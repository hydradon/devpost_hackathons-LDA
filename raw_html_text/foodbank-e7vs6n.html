                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite Canada being a wealthy country, food bank use remains at unacceptably high levels. Contrary to popular misconceptions, food banks users span the spectrum of our society. According the Food Banks Canada's

                    , 1 in 8 are currently employed, 34.1% are children, and seniors are the fastest growing user group. We wanted to tackle one aspect of this social issue, which is the availability and accessibility of healthy foods at food banks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For donors, our apps gamifies the food donation process. One common hurdle for food banks is the lack of consistent donations - there is usually a rush of donations around the holiday seasons which tapers off quickly. Our goals is that by gamifing the process and "levelling up" users as they donate, it will incentivise consistent donations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For users, our project provides a way for them to see what's available at different food banks easily. This would help them access what they need more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For food banks, this allows them to specify their needs and create a more personal connection to their community.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Figma to create UI/UX mockups, and then implemented them using React Native.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the time constraint. With only 12-ish hours, we had to ideate at breakneck speed and once we settled on our concept, we were left with not much time to code. Our second challenge is the varying programming experience in our team, with some of our team members with little to no experience with React Native.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea we came up with and think it has merit. We are happy with what we accomplished in the little time we had.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about food banks and the societal issues around them, and we learned about working in a diverse team with different skill sets. On a more technical note, we learned more about coding with React Native.

                    Next steps would include moving the app towards a more functional beta version. Right now, we have the bare skeleton prototype, and we are excited to build it out more.
