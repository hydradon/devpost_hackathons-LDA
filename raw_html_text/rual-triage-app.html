                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members works at a local emergency room, he talked about the issues facing a packed hospital especially during flu season. We wanted to give the medical staff a bird's eye view of their patients in order to choose where they should allocate their resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows for smart phone communication between the medical staff and the patients of the clinic. The patients are able to provide anonymous information regarding their symptoms, medication, and history, and the medical staff is able to view the data. The staff can then make better informed decisions regarding the order of treatment and the chain of care for patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end (user interface) is built in flutter for both the admin and user sides, the back end that allows for communication is written in php with a mysequal database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the development of the back-end database which at times had difficulty communicating with the front end user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy with the versatility of our product as we were able to create a product that was viable for both Android and IOS users. This should help remove barriers and improve the quality of care between different facilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the dart/flutter language during the development process. All members of the team had previously created applications in dart but they were all much more simplistic. Building this project taught us about important features that help communicate with a backend server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rual-Triage App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step would be to add more features that would make the process easier for the front end users. Some steps we could take to accomplish are adding dropdown menus for common symptoms, adding a list of common medications, or adding "faces" next to all of the pain levels to provide a visual representation.
