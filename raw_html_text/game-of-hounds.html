                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watched a video with people playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf and did not want to spend 20 bucks on the cards. We also wanted to play games with friends easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to play Ultimate Werewolf through SMS and spectators can watch through the website.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website: HTML5/CSS3/Javascript &amp; JQuery
Game: Twilio, Heroku, Python

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to update the users every time someone texted, update it on our end, and then send the results back to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to receive texts instantly after we texted the Twilio phone number.
The website has a minimalist design. We were able to link up Twilio and Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Twilio api.
