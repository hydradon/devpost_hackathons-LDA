                    Welcome to Docket Science, the future of documents.Through Docket Science's refined Machine Learning, we will eventually sort through data and extract meaningful and invaluable information about society for society. You will not have to be a data scientist in order to make sense of data. Back then, you had to be part of a select few in order to operate a computer, but computer science has advanced past being unimaginably difficult to understand and is now utilized by many. Technology has now put us in a position where more people can create meaningful and impressive content. Our hope about the future of documents is that it will be easily understood and useful beyond imagination and sustainability.

                <p>
                    Using html, css, javascript, python and php. We also incorporated Google Custom Search API to parse data and get visual data analysis in hopes to improve with Machine Learning.

                <p>
                    It was hard to create the data visualization with the python scatterbox package and we were not able to implement it with our own data.
