                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of three bio-med students and a highschooler with little to no background in computer science. We are very passionate about health and decided to create a platform to help people find out if they are at risk of suffering from obstructive sleep apnea. As the healthcare in the U.S can be very expensive for many, we thought it would be helpful to have a website that provide a free screening tool for people that think they may suffer from this condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This questionnaire is a very sensitive approach to everyone, and has you answer a few questions to accumulate advice about sleep apnea for the person taking the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we used the IDE Visual Studios and then transferred that to Repl.it which allowed us to run the code easier. After that, we used Brackets to make the web page using html5 and css. We used domain.com to purchase our own domain and GitHub to post it online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domain.com's services were a little difficult to use properly. We had to switch from multiple IDEs before finally finding a few that worked with our codes. Another major issue was lack of experience. This is because it was the entire team's first hackathon. Two of the team members had no prior coding experience while the other two had limited/basic knowledge of python, java, html, and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing and debugging the codes within the time limit considering only two had the technical knowledge to program. The other two teammates contributed to background information and research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to pull an actual all-nighter while providing moral support and maintaining a cheery demeanor. We learned a lot about Google Cloud Platform and Android Studios during the workshops. The intro to Python workshop was super helpful. We also learned to use Google to it's fullest extent. So thanks Google!

                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can make this applicable to other disorders or make a device or mobile iOS/Android app with a picture matching algorithm.
