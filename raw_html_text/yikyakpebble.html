                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first Hack-a-thon ever! Early on, I found the hardware station and checked out the Pebble. It was really cool, so I thought that I could develop an app that was present on my iPhone that the Pebble didn't already have. Yik Yak and its infrastructure was was simple enough for me to utilize in order to make this app. This weekend was a blast, my love for computer science and curiosity for it has blossomed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Pebble project allows you to view and vote on yaks in your area. It allows you to sort them based on both time posted and yakarma rating.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use of C code and Pebble SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One aspect of the code that doesn't work that I could not figure out how to fix, is when in the Menu with a list of the yaks, when you click the back button it does not terminate the project and routes the user back to the home screen. Instead, a long press of the back button will end the program once the user is done using the program.
One of the main challenges was that I had no background in C, and Pebble SDK so I spent a lot of time fiddling around with the code and figuring out a fundamental understanding for the code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of the fact that within two days I was able to come up with a decent framework for a popular app using languages that I was unfamiliar with.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that different programming languages are not that hard to learn. I also learned what a hack-a-thon truly is like. I truly enjoyed my weekend here making YakPebble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YakPebble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once I get a hold of Yik Yak API, I will be able to provide a live stream of yaks that would change as a function of GPS location and time.
