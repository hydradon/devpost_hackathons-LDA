                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this site in an attempt to display some serious privacy leaks that are found in some applications, that hackers can access, and is potentially dangerous to the general public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays the apps that we tested, their flaws and privacy issues. It also contains our methodology behind testing the applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was built using basic web development skills; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To test the android applications, we backed up the apk files, and converted them to .tar files and then analyzed the xml documents for sensitive, unencrypted user information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the testing process was difficult. Getting the right commands on the different mediums was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Testing the applications, and understanding which essential apps come short in terms of privacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web development skills, as well as working with application apk files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eXploit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to move forward and attempt the man-in-the-middle hack, and test the applications for privacy issues during communication with the server (e.g. purchasing items).
