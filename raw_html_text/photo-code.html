                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of schools do not have the technology resources to engage students. This project&rsquo;s goal is to provide a system that require low technology resources and enable all the students in the class to be engaged and have the ability to learn coding in an interactive enviroment.  The resources that are required for Photo Code are a printer, camera, and a single computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Photo Code analyzes a picture of multiple QR codes. Each QR code represents a piece of code. The user can rearrange these QR codes and create fully structured code to solve a maze. The picture is turned into python code that will then be run to attempt to solve the maze on a computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Photo Code is built using Python with pygame and an open source QR decoder written in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally we going to make the C program accessible as a python extension. We ran into some roadblocks with this. We also had trouble with the QR decoder reading in QR codes accurately. The decoder trips up sometimes with QR codes that are vertical in relation to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud of the QR decoder and tackling the challenges as they have come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to allow C and Python to interact with each other. We also learned a lot about QR codes and what it takes to make sure a good reading is taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Photo Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next two big things for Photo Code is to create the documentation and curriculum for teachers to use. We also need to improve the accuracy of the QR decoder. We also would like to redevelop the idea into a mobile app so that the process is smooth.
