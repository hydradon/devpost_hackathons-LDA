                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When studying for an exam for a class, many student's go-to study method is flash cards. Flash cards are effective for some students, but for other students they are not helpful. There are seven learning styles: verbal, visual, aural, physical, social, logical and solitary. We want to cater to students who fall into these categories by providing a study tool for different learning styles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can sign in and create flash cards that are specific to their learning style. They can upload images, audio files, and text. Based on the learning style they choose, Se7enth Sense will search for images and videos for the user to add to their flash card stack. They can view their previous and current stack of flash cards on their My Cards homepage.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask, a web development framework, to connect the HTML pages and python scripts. We used Bootstrap and HTML/CSS for the website pages. For our database that contains the flash cards, we implemented a SQLite database. To search bing, we used the Bing Web Search API and Azure application service to deploy our web application.
                </p>
