                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data helps us to understand and improve business processes to reduce wasted money and time, but in another term, if we consider domains such as healthcare and finance, data security and confidentiality is the most important thing. All such companies invest a lot of money on data security check with the help of forming big information security teams, All these are repetitive processes and audit coverage is limited to 2-3 persons per team. We can easily automate these processes with the help of correct tools and techniques which will increase the audit coverage to ensure confidentiality and security of data along with decreasing resource cost and increase in overall efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal to automate the entire process of data security checks so that we can ensure confidentiality, and security of the organization data along with increase in audit coverage.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We entirely built a given utility with the help of the
                    <strong>
                        UiPath
                    </strong>
                    application along with few
                    <strong>
                        VB script
                    </strong>
                    codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a given application from scratch. initially, we had zero knowledge about the UiPath application, We have tried so many things and learned it. It's a very easy application to understand, Even if you are from a non-coding background, It is possible to write automation scripts in minimal efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to say that our utility to perform data security checks includes all below functionalities:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Antivirus status of a given machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encryption status of data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Access to storage sites such as GoogleDrive, Dropbox.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Access to social media platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The number of users having access to the given machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All illegal software installed in a given machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Bluetooth is available then the port number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Track if protected data is shared by using email.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of UiPath, we have learned how to identify the unique elements and which selectors to use for each element. An interesting thing about UiPath is you can integrate any code which you know with it and automate daily repeating processes. The most important thing we have learned is team-efforts, equal work distribution, and proper communication is required between the team to accomplish things in limited time. Among the automation products present in the market like UFT and Selenium, UiPath is very easy to understand and learn even if a person is from a non-technical background.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Auto Auditor with UIPath
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement a given application in Master-slave architecture so that we will place our script on a server machine and an auditor will run it on all local machines by using admin credentials. In this way, we can completely automate the auditing process and we can run Auto auditor script parallelly on all local machines.
