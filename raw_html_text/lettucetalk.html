                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we learned that we had access to the Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c, we challenged ourselves to use a new set of hardware. With one word in mind, "lettuce," we created a social network because the technology was there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the surface, it's "just" a messenging app. But upon a closer look, it's so much more! You can chat with a bot that has a wonderfully witty sense of humor, albeit some typos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the task into different components; teamwork was essential. First, there had to be an interface. We made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (of course). Then, we had to make a backend that was capable of connecting all the users to each other. For this, we combined PHP and a MySQL database to create powerful creation on such a tiny server. Finally, we wanted to add some artistic flair in the form of a BotRoccoli, a chatbot that gave insight into how to make a conversation, not just a chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, they were abundant! The Dragonboard and the school's internet connection got off on the wrong foot. While trying to diagnose this, we had to get an entirely difference Dragonboard. And then, when we finally connected it to the internet, it soon after disconnected. In the end, we overcame this with a little something called Personal Hotspot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LettuceTalk has always been a dream of ours, but we never had the opportunity to fulfill this dream. During these 24 hours, we bonded a lot and made a good app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to take advantage of the sheer computational power of the Dragonboard.

                    What's next for LettuceTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just you wait, and someday it'll be on the cover of Time magazine.
