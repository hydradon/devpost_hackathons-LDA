                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the holidays, my family likes to play a horse racing board game that typically costs $100 in stores.  I wanted to create an application version that would do the same thing but easier for anyone to get ahold of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives a board game fun for all ages the ability to be at the palm of your hand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never really coded in swift before so it was like learning a new language
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end I was more supportive of the programs notes and was able to create an alpha version of the applicaton
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic coding skills for swift
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue to work on the project and form a full team to license it and put it out for public consumption
