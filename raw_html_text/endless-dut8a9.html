                    In the game Endless, your objective is to enter colored objects of your own and avoid those different from you.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Endless is built on Xcode Swift 3.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that I encountered, and among those were complications of errors and sometimes small spelling errors.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I have many challenges, I am still proud of being able to entirely restart a new game build during the last few weeks of Makeschool and yet still finish on time.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learn how to code in Swift 3 during my two months at Makeschool and many helpful tips along the way.
