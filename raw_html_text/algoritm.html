                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by neural networks and deep learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a neural network and input of a sentence to detect if there is bias in the sentence. This is done after it is trained by reading in a large database of sentences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the general idea of an artificial neural network and implemented it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about the neural networks, debugging, dealing with uncommon words(names, numbers, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud of implementing a neural network from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for bias detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it more accurate by creating a larger database and trying different functions for changing the weights.
