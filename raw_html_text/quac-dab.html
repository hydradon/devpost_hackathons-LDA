                    A probabilistic database cleaning software that helps data scientists improve the accuracy and validity of their data. Given a dataset, QuacDab generates the likelihood of erroneous data, pinpoints their occurrences, and suggests more accurate values.

                    As students with data science experience, we were inspired by a paper published by researchers at Georgia Tech that ventured into probabilistic data cleaning. Thinking that it would be extremely beneficial to have an automated, streamlined approach to cleaning and analyzing datasets, we set out to create a user-friendly, interactive, and intelligent system that helps with preliminary data cleaning. The core logic behind our service is the concepts of low-rank approximation and probability distributions of data points. We assume that valid datasets are a subset of all possible data, and that there is a fuzzy line representing a probability distribution that separates the two. If the user inputs a feature matrix X, our goal is to find the optimal X-hat that is most likely to contain correct data with the fewest number of missing values and map X to it.

                    Using principal component analysis, we determine the best rank lower than X's, with which a matrix can still accurately portray the data variance in X. This is because we believe a matrix in which the columns are dependent upon one another can offer more useful and accurate information on a particular data set. After determining the approximation that appears to be the best, we mark columns in X that have been proven to be most likely incorrect and attempt to fix these values and fill in missing ones using values present in the same columns of similar rows.

                    One of the biggest challenges we faced was learning the math and programming behind our project. We were mostly just familiar with common Python data science libraries and using them to clean data sets. As such, we spent a lot of our time researching the topics of probabilistic data cleaning, singular value decomposition, probabilistic programming, web development with Django, and more to make sure we were approaching this issue with a solid solution. In the end, we were able to learn a lot about these subjects.

                    This is still a work in progress. We're hoping to make our analysis even more accurate, have a more interactive frontend for the user, and perhaps integrate some techniques from quantum computing (so that we may live up to our name). We plan to continue it throughout the school year :)
