                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really hate having to change the aux cord in a car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make a live playlist that allows a party to vote on songs to play. Songs that have high up votes are moved to the front, songs that have too much down votes are removed from the playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to program it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySQL Database would not connect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of thinking of this idea, and since there are approximately 7 hours left, there's plenty more time to do even more.
                </p>
