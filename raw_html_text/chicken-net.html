                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to build a tool that would enable those that have an interest in raising their own food, to try it with less of a time investment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It opens and closes the coop door in the morning and evening. As a precaution to keep chickens from being locked out at night, we have a sensor that counts the chickens to ensure that they have all returned home for the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a wooden demo display and used an Arduino to control the electronic components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally intended to create a graphical interface to compliment our physical prototype. We had difficulty trying to work with unfamiliar hardware, and opted to focus on creating a functional prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we were worried that we would not be able to make the device functional in the allotted time, we ended up creating a well polished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that this may be more viable than we had originally thought. We were able to keep costs low, and can see an opportunity for a scalable business model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for chicken net
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The automatic door is just the start to the potential applications for chicken coop automation. Future prototypes would probably involve using RFID anklets to track the activity of individual animals.
