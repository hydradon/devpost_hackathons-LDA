                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own lack of mental health so we wanted to create something that we could use and others could also use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets users track and log photos and add descriptive comments. Then an AI will analyze the photos and give data/statistic to help you understand your possible mental health during the weeks.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used C# to get the Google Vision API in Google Cloud Shell and built the app in Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud Services does not fully support Android, which meant we could not fully incorporate it into the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the app in Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How you Bean?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully incorporate Google Vision API into our app and polish it so that people may use it to help themselves.
