                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized the potentials value of buyer/supplier relationships and corporate governance information in active investments.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short, it goes long/ short of US stocks with respective features developed from the above dataset while constraint by limiting factor exposures. It archives a total annual return of 3.55% over 2019.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It ingests data from Global Supply Chain Relationships, Supplier Implied Risk Attributes and market data, maps customer-supplier revenue dependencies to the supplier public listed tickers and corporate's governance data to the respective ticker. Then we predict transformed 1-month forward-looking return using an XGBoost model. The model is tested and backtested from the beginning of 2019 until now.
