                    I wanted to help teens, who are usually new drivers and thus bad at parking, to efficiently find parking spaces in a way that optimizes time in the quickest way possible.

                <p>
                    The device efficiently ensures that drivers do not attempt to enter an occupied parking space through the use of an ultrasonic sensor that senses any obstructions and a GPS tracker and GSM system that sends the GPS coordinates of that occupied space to the previously decided phone number; basically, it optimizes parking space finding time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used two Arduino microcontrollers, two breadboards, a GSM, a GPS tracker, and a SIM card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fix (quality of signal) of the GPS was constantly wavering and posed a huge problem as whether or not the text message sent was contingent upon the sufficiency of the fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of having figured out how to use different APIs and libraries by learning from the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, the data collected from multiple users of the device can be uploaded to a community website in which community members can access a live stream of changing parking spots to suit their needs.
