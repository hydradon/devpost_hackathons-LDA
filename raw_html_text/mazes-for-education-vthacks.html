                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computational thinking in today's society is an innate concept that every child should learn regardless of their socioeconomic conditions. Considering this, this app is built with that in mind to teach any child the basics of computational thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows children to apply computational thinking techniques in a relatable and knowledgeable fashion through a maze logic game.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the unity engine, we were able to create our project.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Broad design concepts and their practical applications
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through unity we did not only develop a working maze, but we were also able to assign it various characteristics such as collision detection, error handling, and animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned through unity how to develop a graphically intensive app, the aspects that pertain to the app and their pertinence to the world.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mazes for Education VTHacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to encompass larger and more complex themes of computational thinking and their applications through the development of more level designs that are more fun and educational to better equip children with computational thinking skills in the context of the modern society.
