                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind this started after reading
                    <em>
                        The Martian
                    </em>
                    , and thinking that a survival game based around a similar premise would be pretty cool. While this game is far from done, it is a fun first step towards a full fledged game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game involves taking the role of a mission controller and a Mars Astronaut. After being stranded on the planet, you must guide the astronaut to the pieces of his habitat so that he can survive. Along the way he might run into a few less than friendly Martians! Quick skills and good timing will keep you alive!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the basics of movement and added elements from there. After finishing the mission control view, I moved on to the fight screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was that I have never developed something like this before. Small errors added up quick with rendering animation and were sometimes hard to debug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just finishing the game! It took a lot of work, but it was a good time and I learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some ideas for making future games, a lot more about the canvas element, and some new stuff in Javascript animation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Astro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to add more features to make it a more rounded out game.
                </p>
