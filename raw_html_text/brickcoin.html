                        We believe blockchains have a lot of applications and wanted to see if we could take this idea and make it into a viable product.

                        Create user accounts with unique "wallets" that allow users to trade brickCoin among each other, and add funds to their account and use it as payments.

                    <li>
                        CodeIgniter (PHP) was our main framework, with a MySQL database hosted in Google Cloud, with a blockchain scraping transactions history every 60 seconds and permanently adds it to the blockchain so it can not be edited, in Java.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        Google Cloud took longer than we expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CodeIgniter has config variables that need to be edited per machine to access styles and scripts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Switching programming languages for the blockchain (Python to Java)

                    <li>
                        Database Connectivity - Cloud hosting was completely new to all of us and using the Cloud Shell to access the data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's no functionality for making payments, and adding funds is just a number
