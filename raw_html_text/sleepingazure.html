                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add technology to something that gave you peace instead of the all to common technology that keeps you wired all day. This can help the user improve their sleep by giving them information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It senses when the user is in REM sleep, the most effective rest by using a motion sensing gyro. It then uploads this to the Azure server where the user can access the information and modify their sleeping habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put electronic components in the pillow while being able to position them so the pillow stays nice and comfy. We then use the input from the gyro to sense movement from the sleeper. It will then record the time when the sleeper enters REM sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Photons were unable to connect to the gyro. we had to switch to the arduino at the last moment which was very tough. We also had problems with the Wifi Shield having faulty connections to ground. Also current maximums and minimums tested our knowledge on current amplification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had so much fun and worked so well as a team even when most of us did not know each other. We also were able to implement the goal we set out to do even tho we came across many issues. This perseverance of our team was unwavering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that using different shields and boards can have many implications with its connection to wifi and the server as well as the sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SleepingAzure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to find a way to get the electronic hardware as minimal as possible. Also, We want to be able to make a compelling analysis of the data that can make suggestions using AI for improvement as well as provide understandable graphs to the user.
