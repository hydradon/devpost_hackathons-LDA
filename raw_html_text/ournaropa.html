                    I love reading, but I don't love buying books! So whenever I hear about a good book, I end up manually checking each of the three libraries in the Boulder area that I have access to: Naropa, CU, and BPL. I thought to myself that it couldn't be that hard to search all three at the same time!

                    Search Naropa's Libraries, CU's Libraries, and the Boulder Public Library all at once

                    I've been working on a unified events calendar for Naropa and I'm hoping to also create a better course planning tool than the one we currently have at school.
