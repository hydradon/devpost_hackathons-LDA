                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HVAC systems represent one of the largest components of building energy usage and carbon emissions. An average industrial facility is wasting over 20% of electricity leading to large operations costs. Furthermore, one faulty HVAC system can cost over $6,500/employee/year in employee productivity. Efficient operation of a building depends on the reliable environment, process and behavioral data. However, the availability of such data is still lacking. Many of HVAC systems have undiagnosed issues, which can cause crippling failure that can disable an operation. Furthermore, our buildings often have serious contamination issues, which are not just affecting the energy efficiency of the buildings, but also our health. This problem is particularly significant in hospitals and clinics, which spend over $6.5 B spent on energy and are affected by over $45 B annual direct operation costs due to contamination due to malfunctioning air distribution systems. There&rsquo;s an untapped opportunity of innovation.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeavAir harnesses advanced sensor technology and predictive analytics to: 1) reduce HVAC maintenance costs and equipment failure, 2) reduce building operation costs, 3) improve health and productivity of employees. We develop patent-pending modules that attach to vents to measure the air coming out of these systems. WeavAir system can also reduce the liability, helping building owners comply with green building standards and building code while improving the workers&rsquo; health and productivity. The technology can be used for quality control of industrial processes as well as manufacturing contamination control. It is suitable for integration in a variety of building types including but not limited to healthcare, commercial, industrial and residential buildings.
