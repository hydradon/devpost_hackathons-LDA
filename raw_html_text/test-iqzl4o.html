                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring has come, the beginning of a new life. In Japan, Spring is a season of farewells and meeting new people and moving to another location. But we&rsquo;re usually bone-tired after moving, unpacking of their baggage. This hack is intended to finish moving in a fun and convenient condition. And it is for welcoming our brilliant new life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using MINIKURA API and AR technology, we propose  a new unpacking experience.
                    <br>
                    One of the most common problem of unpacking is user may forgot which boxes of his / her luggage to put in. Just by holding the smartphone and using our app, you can know it.
                    <br>
                    Our app overlays box info (currently only luggage category, such as "book", "clothing", etc..) on AR marker that is printed on moving box. You can show list of luggages by tapping on AR Marker.

                    Accomplishments that I&rsquo;m proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to create a service that meets the needs of users.
This hack will lead to an increase in the value of "MINIKURA".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We devised cooperation between building environment and each system.
                    <br>
                    Also we realized that good food produces good ideas :)
                    <br>
                    We recognized the importance of ideas, design, coding skills and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for &ldquo;YOUR PROJECT&rdquo;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User will make own "virtual closet" by using MINIKURA and storing his/her items continuously. We think this leads to make another service formation such as sharing closet. If user go abroad, user can borrow local clothes from MINIKURA closet. And in future, even people living in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere can share clothes each other. This project will be the entrance for the user to use MINIKURA.
