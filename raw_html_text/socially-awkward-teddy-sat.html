                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something fun and challenging, so through enough brainstorming we decided on this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SAT runs away screaming when approached, and was meant to have consent enabled hug functionality, but we didn't manage to finish that part
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the robot using a teddy bear that was gutted and who had extra cloth sown onto his back for extra carrying capacity, we then used an Arduino uno and an accelerometer to make it self balancing, and an ultrasound sensor to detect distance. The wiring and circuits were all housed inside a wooden laser-cut shell
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial motor selections were unable to be powered by our batteries, so we had to switch motors and wheels and circuit housing boxes several times. 
Additionally, the teddy bear wasn't large enough, so we had to sow on extra fabric to extend the space available in its interior
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to get the teddy bear into a presentable state
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One needs to account for limited hardware components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Socially Awkward Teddy(SAT)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're gonna complete it to full functionality (i.e. being able to sense when someone says hug me and then rushing over to hug them)
