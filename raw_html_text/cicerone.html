                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a way for anyone to be familiar with an unfamiliar location -- to have a tour guide for any path one might take.

                <p>
                    Cicerone is "a local to guide you, wherever you are." It is an android app designed to be able to give a "tour" of any interesting locations you happen to pass by, whether you're walking, driving, or flying. The core idea is to let the user explore while the application highlights

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cicerone is built for Android, making use of Java, Google Maps API, and mobile text-to-speech. The app itself makes use of map data and wiki information in order to describe locations in a way the user will understand.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of development, we had to resolve collision between many nearby locations, alter the search radius based on mode of transportation, find an optimal text-to-speech quality, and ensure the application could communicate effectively with the user.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting this up and running is the absolute most satisfying accomplishment. The simplest accomplishment and the most important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android, and the value of small teams. We doubted ourselves coming into this as a team of two, but working together was very doable and communication was concise. Questions that came up about Android development were always easy to discuss and solutions were always found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cicerone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cicerone will live on as a project between Rikesh and Carl, but it still has room to grow. The UX needs some work and some love; what Cicerone is so far is built with functionality in mind, but any good journey requires some style. We also plan on including more data about locations in the app/ images of said locations. Additionally, we would like to apply machine learning to Cicerone's priority algorithm to ensure the user is given the most interesting landmarks, and we would like to include a tour routing system within the app.
