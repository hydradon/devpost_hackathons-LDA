                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, I find myself working for upwards of two hours just trying to make my schedule work. I often get to a completed schedule, only to find that there was a MUCH more efficient way to solve the problem, resulting in a lot less hassle. This is the problem that #rehash plans to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program takes your list of plans, and effortlessly comes up with a schedule to fit your tasks in during the day. The user can input the priority of the task, if it needs to be during a certain time of day, or just leave it to default. There is also the option to add a spice of color to the project by specifying calendar block color :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This desktop application was built using python, with kivy for an integrated gui. The application is based off of a custom sorting algorithm, which attempts to imitate human scheduling patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first gui-integrated application, so the formatting took a lot of getting used to. Our algorithm also ran into a few problems during the brainstorming stage(our "ideal" algorithm ended up being O(n^2), so we had to make some adjustments to make it run rapidly)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A custom algorithm that works, and a fully functional gui application! We put a lot of thought into the concepts of the project and I hope to expand it after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the formatting issues that commonly plague front end developers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for #rehash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kivy has a native app development platform that we hope to use in order to expand our idea. We messed around some with it at the hackathon, but really only had time for the base of the project. We also aim to clean up the ui in order to make it more pleasing for the end user.
