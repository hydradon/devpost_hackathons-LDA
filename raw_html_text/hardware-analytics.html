                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware engineers need dashboard and visualization tools like Google Analytics and Mixpanel like the software engineers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product (hardware + software) enables real time battery power and plots it on a dashboard. This can enable engineers to see if there is any increase in power consumption between software builds. It also helps to quantify the battery needed for each feature added
