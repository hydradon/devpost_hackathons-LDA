                    Inspiration...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for creating this web page first came from me not being able to take a CS course in High School. I made it with the intention to educate anyone who reads it-government officials, teachers, students, cs and non-cs students alike-on why Computer Science should be integrated into the modern day educational system.

                <p>
                    I built an html/css/bootstrap webpage that acts as a blog post on a blogging platform website. Provides links to my social media accounts (facebook, twitter, instagram, github, and linkedin) through icons located at the bottom of the screen that look like their respective logo (functional). Also provides previous and next buttons to go to different posts on the blogging platform located at the bottom of the screen (non-functional). Provides links to all sources claimed throughout the article and also provides a video of why computer science should be taught in grades k-12 (functional). Provides a picture of a graph that shows the discrepancies between men, women, blacks and latinos in the computer science industry (Functional). Has 2 dead links that act as a directory to a home page and a directory that allows readers to subscribe to a newsletter at the top of the webpage. Page has 2 jumbotrons in the center of the page that are filled with everything listed above and provides a contrast against the cornell red background that I wrote into the webpage design.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using html, css, and bootstrap in Sublime Text. I taught myself how to make it by reading how to online, mainly through StackOverflow, GitHub and w3.

                    I had no prior coding knowledge so most of my time at this Hackathon (my first) was spent doing research and reading how to write the actual code. There was like an hour where I didn't know how to change the color of the background until I asked someone from my club out of frustration...I'm serious. I was also tempted to jump off of Clark 700 at numerous different times because I couldn't figure things out and really wanted to present something for my first hackathon. I also found that making the transition from diurnal to nocturnal and then making a transition from nocturnal to saying "fuck it" and not even sleeping at all was tough at times idk.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made something that I can show people and hopefully educate them on a topic I think is important. I'm proud that I did this in the first place, but also in what I thought was a really small time frame. I got pushed out of my comfort zone which was good. I also learned html, css, bootstrap and got inspired to work on more projects in the future. Also proud that I didn't change majors or punch a hole through my macbook pro in frustration. I now also have bragging rights over everyone I talk to in my CSE115 Lecture/Lab.
