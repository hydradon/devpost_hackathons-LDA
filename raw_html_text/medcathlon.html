                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a pharmacy student, I was always taught about the concept of adherence and how many problems happen between when the physician prescribes a medication and when the patient actually uses the drug. We've always thought about the potential of a digital health app for long-term gains in the number of adherent patients. Reading prescription labels is particularly challenging for the approximately 77 million Americans who only have basic health literacy. Subsequently, doctors typically have no idea, once the e-prescription has been sent to the pharmacy, whether the drug is ever picked up or is being taken as directed. So, we wanted to tackle these two major barriers to medication adherence for patients in the transition of care and outpatient settings.
