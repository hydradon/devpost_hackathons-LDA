                    Schools throughout the country have people trained to deal with sexual harassment victims in a human way. However, their work is widely unknown by the students and schools provide only cold forms, which are anything but empathetic to people who are feeling vulnerable. Libero is an app that provides a 3 steps connection between a survivor and the school's victims advocate offices anonymously, providing a space for victims to feel supported and the schools respond effectively to dangerous situations.
