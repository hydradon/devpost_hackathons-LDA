                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realized the problem of adaptation the prisoners face once they leave the prison. This alienation prevents the prisoners` adaptation so it was a problem required to be solved. There are imprisoned people with impressive skills yet no ability to display them so we had to give them this chance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It enables hiring prisoners get profitable jobs helping fight the scourge of exploitation in the prison system. It consists of three 'ends' for the different participants in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The home route, linkinmates.herokuapp.com/, is for prisoners -- there they can sign up and create a profile which employers can view or login to update their profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For security purposes, prison officials need to approve their prisoners to seek jobs. This must be done before prisoner's profiles would be seen by employers. This is done at linkinmates.herokuapp.com/prison -- note all fields must be filled for the prisoner to be successfully approve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recruiters can send hire requests to prisoners at linkinmates.herokuapp.com/admin. They simply select the category they are interested in and click the 'hire' button of the prisoner they would like to reach out to. Prisoners can receive plain text emails in many jurisdictions, hence when a recruiter hits hire, the prisoner is sent an email. Ideally, the recruiter would still need to reach out the prison before employment begins.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web application with NodeJS, MDBootstrap, EJS using icons from FontAwesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with creating a system for the different stages of authorization before the prisoner is made eligible for employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We struggled with creating a suitable frontend system that integrated with our idea.

                <p>
                    We created a system that, though not complete, provides the basic functionality of what we had in mind.
