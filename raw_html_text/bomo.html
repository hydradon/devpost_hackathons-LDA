                    What is BOMO?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BOMO is an AR mobile app that allows clinicians, coaches, and patients alike to easily quantify body movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        You&rsquo;re playing a game of intense basketball. As you are about to shoot the  tie-breaking shot, you tear your ACL. You go to the doctor sulking in defeat, and during weeks of physical therapy, your PT arbitrarily asks you to  &ldquo;try a little harder than last week&rdquo; during each session. However, your PT soon hears about the app BOMO, where they are now able to objectively track your knee recovery with just a smart phone. With BOMO, you are now able to have extremely detailed records of your rehabilitation and see your progress in an immersive and personalized way without the use of expensive hardware or software.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    BOMO can not only track joint flexion angles, which are useful for measuring flexibility progress, but it can also track joint movement in

                    </em>
                    , allowing users to analyze common dysfunctions such as lateral knee movement during walking and running, tracking overall joint stability, and measuring muscular imbalances&hellip;all with just a smartphone.
                </p>

                    The 3 C&rsquo;s of Healthcare:  Cost, convenience, consistency.

                    <strong>
                        COST
                    </strong>
                    :
Software to accurately track joint flexion, walking patterns, and body movement is extremely costly and hard to setup in a normal environment: e.g., a home, gym, or small doctor&rsquo;s office.

                    <strong>
                        CONVENIENCE
                    </strong>
                    :
In order to actually get accurate measurmenets, you likely have to go to a motion analysis lab and have the ability to access one in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        CONSISTENCY
                    </strong>
                    :
Physical therapists and doctors often don&rsquo;t take enough care to consistently take accurate measurments and often &ldquo;eyeball&rdquo; their results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, ARKit doesn't offer support for image/marker tracking, so we used Vuforia as the base library for our computer vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire thing is built in Objective-C, C++, and Swift, and BOMO processes everything locally. Currently, our prototype includes the use of several physical markers to track joint movement, but given enough time in the future, pose estimation technology and improved phone hardware will allow us to track joint movement natively, without any markers&ndash;&ndash; similar to the Xbox kinect.
                </p>

                        Tyler
                    </em>
                    previously did physical therapy research in a Motion Analysis lab, constantly monitoring the walking rehabilitation progress of patients and using cumbersome, expensive software and hardware to get relatively simple data.

                    </em>
                    works in a neuromechanics lab and designs Virtual Reality experiences to experiment with anxiety, trauma, and movement disorders. Combining this with the fact that there are currently no reliable real-time motion tracking apps on the app store, the need to make a medical and mobile-first, AR motion tracking app became obvious.

                <h2>
                    The implications of BOMO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from basic tracking joint movement, we can track the velocity of different limb movements and plan on implementing a feature that can calculate power produced based on the test subject&rsquo;s weight or weight lifted during a movement, allowing BOMO to easily make its way into the fitness market not only as an injury prevention and analysis tool, but as a sports metrics tracker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because BOMO exists purely in a smartphone based environment, it can potentially drastically reduce the cost of gathering useful physical metrics from patients and athletes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BOMO also potentially expands the medical community&rsquo;s ability to acquire field data and design mobile-first, travel-friendly research. In an ideal scenario, BOMO exists within an entire Telehealth-based system, where patients can log data at home and contribute remotely to a huge database of medical data&ndash; further contributing to the development of machine learning&rsquo;s impact in healthcare.
