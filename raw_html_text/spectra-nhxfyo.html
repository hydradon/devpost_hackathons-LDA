                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than 3.5 million American people live with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A majority of them have alexithymia which prohibits them from being able to recognize emotions and react accordingly. Overall, technology has been evolving education, however, it has been excluding people with mental disabilities. All people deserve access to education that is beneficial to them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spectra is a Microsoft HoloLens application that teaches people with autism how to comprehend and reciprocate emotions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Microsoft Face API, Unity, Visual Studio, and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    INTEGRATING THE FACE API. There were many errors and the entire debugging process was very demoralizing. Despite such adversities, when the application ran, it was worth it.

                <p>
                    Building our first augmented reality app and successfully being able to integrate the face API.

                    What's next for Spectra
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build a better UI as well as integrate a dynamic learning module. This will be tailored to the user, allowing for an effective learning experience. Lastly, we want to make this technology more accessible.
