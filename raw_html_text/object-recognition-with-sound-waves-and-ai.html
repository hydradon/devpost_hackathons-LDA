                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses machine learning algorithm to recognize sounds from different objects in real time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We modified the pyAudioAnalysis library to fit our needs and used its SVM machine learning algorithm to classify sounds from different objects. We had to use multi-threading in order to get real-time audio data and have it analyzed at the same time to reduce latency between the signal and dentition of the signal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was accounting for the amount of ambient noise we had in our room. We did this classifying noise into its own category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was to modify the pyAudioAnalysis library to take real-time data instead of saved ".wav" files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the last challenge was to get different processes running on different threads to reduce latency.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieved 90% accuracy in recognizing objects with sound alone.

                <p>
                    In the future we will attempt to decrease the latency and use it to different things such as play real-time music, and play games.
