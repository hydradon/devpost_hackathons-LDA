                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting help from professors is sometimes difficult if you are shy or due to their busy schedule. We want to solve these problems through technology. wouldn't it be good if same kind of help the students get through office hours will also get at their convenience from home.

                    Academic live chat is the platform similar to Piazza but with the additional features of letting the Professors to create the chat bots to answer the FAQS to students. also our platform provides the live video chat feature to help solve the doubts of students if the bots are not able to answer the questions

                <h2>
                    How it was Built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node js layer to communicate with IBM watson assistant for creating and training the bots. We have used the react.js to provide the User interface for both professors and students.

                <p>
                    Getting the consensus on an idea is the most difficult part for all the teams.. we brainstormed the four ideas and finally after a lot of discussion we all were aboard on building the platform for academia.

                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the chat bot in the most user friendly way is the most difficult challenge. we designed the algorithm that would let the professors train the bot in natural language and out algorithm will map this to appropriate api calls to watson api for the correct dialog flows and training.
