                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Motivated to develop an open source music sharing platform monetized with user experience and listenability a priority. We want to connect beat makers to rap artists to sell their beats, collaborate, and then publish drm protected music. Collaboration profits are distributed via our Ethereum Smart Contract. 
Promote and incentivize original content by fingerprinting OG submissions and minting to a KeyToken. The KeyToken gives incentive to participate in the On-Chain Governance, records transactions via public ledger, and distributes song profits to the token's owner if tied to an original song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also fascinated with decenteralized storage. I chose Storj because of its availability and the few limitations. The main limitation is loss of streaming support in exchange for data validity. I circumvent Storj's streaming limitation by using Storj as a large, cold-storage provider. Storj holds the unpopular songs that are available but rarely requested. This allows Etherad.io to be hosted on offshore VPS providers that offer cheap, low storage vps plans and take payments in Crypto. :)

                <p>
                    Provides an audio stream of songs played in an order decided by KeyCoin voters.

                    For Beat Bounties I utilized the Gitcoin smartcontract and web repository for examples. Gitcoin has a bridge that communicated with between browser and web3.js. For data hosting, Storj provides a super cost-efficient cold-storage solution ideal for backups. Google has released astreaming platform that will be tested in conjuction with Livepeer for video and audio streams. This will allow Etheradio to expand fo the music video market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the website, a producer will able to fund a beat bounty, requesting artist support to complete a song. A fork from Gitcoin web provides the tools to display all funded beat bounties with filters. Methods from the Gitcoin smart contract facilitate the bounty creation and fulfillment. I am proposing a new vertical implementation for connecting Music Producers and Engineers with Artists.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a development environment for forking and developing on the Gitcoin was burdensome and most time consuming. I haven't got the chance to work with Solidity to create my tokens or work with the smart contract. My teammate stopped meeting up with me after the first night and I have had to organize my time to accomplish the little I have. I didn't develop a simple smart contract of my own implemented into the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I networked with many people at the event and was inspired by the amazing things they've done. Their support rose my motivation and kept me in the present when the overwhelming future was looming overhead. I arranged to have my student loans brokered through SALT. I learned that there are many more developer tools for Ethereum than other faster blockchains such as Ripple. I met Doug from Livepeer and we got a working livestream served through his blockchain streaming platform. Although I wasn't able to develop a demo, I made lifelong friends at this exciting event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Contracts are based on Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum. This language is based off JavaScript and runs on an Ethereum Virtual Machine. I learned how a network can be abused and cause inefficiency. This is commonly seen when an authority signs double spend transactions. To improve the ecosystem we must extend both horizontal and vertical implementation of Ethereum by developing for existing markets.

                    Invest in artists by offering their ICO or exchange artist tokens for main Cryptocurrencies.

                    Turn a producers instrumental to an original song via Beat Bounties:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Producer creates a beat bounty listing at etherad.io/findartist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An interested artist selects the bounty and can listen to the beat via audio stream. The artist and producer collaborate over instant messenging (Status protocol)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, the vocal artist is counted in by the application and starts a vocal recording.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Afterwards, the producer listens to a stream of the vocal track to confirm it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The completed bounty results in the release of funds from Smart Contract to the vocal artist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Song fingerprinted and minted to unique token

                    Trilla began as a pirate radio station. A pirate radio station with simple goals:
    1) Free speech audio and music publishing platform available the masses from a safe, remote location
    1) b. Mobile and dispensible equipment
    - Backups via Storj using revenue from BAT monetization (no audio or video ads)
    - Revenue generated from providing the beat bounty listing. Goes towards offshore VPS, domain,
    - ...DDoS protection, Storj backup, and physical data storage solutions. 
    2) Broadcast to our targeted audience

                <p>
                    These are Trilla's goals. 
Trilla is a tool for producers to rapidly select a vocalist to create a song from unsold or underlicensed instrumentals.
