                    Our goal was to create an application that simultaneously reduced food waste and improved the health and convenience of those who used it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built a food inventory manager and advisor that uses individual data to optimally advise health needs and consumption metrics.

                <p>
                    In the process, we learned just how much potato one man needs to consume to live another day.
