                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that USC students tend to adhere to a pre-defined notion of success. The users we interviewed prior to the event said they were looking for plausibility. They wanted to know whether or not diverging from traditional paths to success were actually going to result in tangible results, like interesting jobs, cool internships, or opportunities to work on projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a platform in which we could share media about what it really means to redefine success. From videos expressing the importance of our mission and our commitment to mental health to curated interviews of USC alumni who learned to carve their own paths, we wanted to remind people that they have the power to define success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to create a front-end representation of our app - essentially a coded wireframe.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design was difficult because we wanted to convey that this would be a safe, calming space for them to explore their passions, but at the same time, we wanted to keep it visually interesting for them.
