                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game I played as a kid called Overball.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It let's the user play as a ball that is controlled by the mouse. The user is then supposed to collect all the flowers and crystals to complete the level. Along the way, enemies will try to kill the user which the user must avoid and kill using powerups.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built and designed using Unity game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into were the time it took to create the level as well as how to setup colliders between objects in unity. Another problem was sharing variables between scripts in Unity since Unity doesn't let you have global variables.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments I'm proud of are creating a fully fledged game using my own level design. I'm happy I was able to design the game since the old game I used to play as a kid was really fun.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create a game in Unity.

                    What's next for Underball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd say to have it released on steam for free.
