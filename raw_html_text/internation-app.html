                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all international students at UBC, and adapting to a new place can be challenging at first, either as a passing by visitor or a permanent resident. This is a situation that a lot of international students struggle with, and it extends to anyone who's visiting a foreign city. Hence, we decided to make Internation-app, an application that integrates a series of topics that are helpful for anyone who's visiting a foreign city, from meeting new people to having handy emergency contacts. Our users will be incentivized to entry information belonging to their home city, allowing the content of the page to grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is divided in 4 current tabs: meeting people, what to eat, useful resources and whats the weather. Meeting people gives you a series of events that are happening in the city and people who are traveling to those destinations in case you want a buddy. These would later be extracted from an eventbrite API or similar. What to eat gives a series of restaurants and signature foods that are in this city, and it offers a filtering system to meet dietary adjustments to anyone using it. Useful resources gives you a list of guidelines prior to going the destination of interest based on your country of origin (visas, permits etc), a getting around tab that lets you easily find ways of transportations and a list of emergency contacts to have accessible anywhere. Last but not least we have the whats the weather tab, that walks you through the apparel you should wear based on the season, tips for things to bring, etc.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used react-native and css to establish the application hierarchy and styling.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to keep up with the time designation and deliver an mvp given the scope of the hackathon. We wanted to achieve more but had to ditch some ideas along the way.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our homepage and overall working in the organization we had as a team. Since there were a lot of things to cover, we divided and conquered the tasks, played to our strengths, and ended up delivering a satisfactory product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about ourselves as team players; we hang out as buddies but we don't often code together as a group. We discovered the joy to work with one another, see your and your friend's results come to live, and have a great experience. Personally I didn't have much experience with react native, but my friends gave me a hand at the beginning and helped me get started. Overall great experience and potentially the start of a permanent team for future hackathons.

                <p>
                    Welp, haha, there's a lot of design that needs to be put in place. I think the ideas are there, or at least thought out, which is great! The styling and the implementation of the rest of our features should be codd when finals are over and we get our lives back (ha ha..) but overall I'm happy we were able to put up our skills to the test and deliver our product :).
