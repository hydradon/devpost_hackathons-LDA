                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to create an experience with Virtual Reality and Vocal Recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is a Virtual Reality Shooter that allows the player to use special abilities triggered by voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was built in Unity using available assets which we integrated with the Oculus Rift to provide a truly immersive experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also utilized Unity's Windows Speech library to integrate vocal recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Made use of open source audio files, textures, and effects for various mechanics that enrich the user's experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to create a two-player experience with Virtual and Vocal Recognition, however, due to technical difficulties as well as limitations of the Oculus Hardware, we were not able to proceed with that idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some other technical challenges that occurred include that of deprecated or incompatible codebases that were not optimized in any shape or form for the Oculus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also at the beginning, we truly struggled to come up with and commit to any captivating ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the inconvenient wired internet logistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transitioning the game from a 2D orthographic perspective to an immersive Virtual Reality first-person perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drastic modifications made from the preexisting included project environment to the end project environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating the player's special abilities from scratch that fully utilize Vocal Recognition.
