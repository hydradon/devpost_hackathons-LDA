                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking of creating a website relating to gambling and came up with this idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put in the requested variables and it calculates out your chance of reaching your goal based off of the game you have created
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP scope is fairly frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Site works properly, included functions work well, functions are happy with their global variables
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP must have a list of global variables after the keyward "global" to be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Website For Gambling Addiction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to make the site look a little nicer and would like to add some advertisements. The money from the adds would go towards a charity for gambling addiction.
