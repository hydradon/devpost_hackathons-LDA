                    Inspiration: We've been hoping to innovate the way we can control technology. It's already evolved from keyboards to touchscreens, and now we hope for wireless gestures!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works: The Myo Armband detects electrical activity in the arm muscles by using its 8 EMG sensors, located on the inner armband. Gestures are programmed to be recognized when specific arm or wrist movements are made. These gestures can be applied when simply browsing the web or even when playing games such as Skyrim.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Some challenges that we experienced were programming the Myo Armband to our specific arm gestures. Many times we would make a fist, for example, and Myo would recognize it as an open hand. However, once we learnt how sensitive this product is, we got the hang of it and were ready to apply it to actual uses.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are proud that we were able to get the Myo Armband to connect with Skyrim and the computer in general. In the beginning we believed it would be incompatible, however with all the small steps that we take, it reached our goals.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We learned how to incorporate motion gestures to keystrokes and mouse movements. And we learned that even the most complex things can be made simple with little simple steps.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AWMyo: In the near future, we hope to incorporate the use of two Myo Armbands in not just Skyrim, but many other games ranching from MMO's to FPS's. One armband at a time we will allow users to play games hands free. Once two arms can be used, we want to add the Rift into the project to immerse the user in a totally VR interactive experience.
