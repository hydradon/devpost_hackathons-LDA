                <p>
                    Every year, more than 100,000 wildfires, clearing 5 million acres of land, are reported in the U.S. Despite these statistics, there is a significant lack of wildfire relief systems which has led to extremely detrimental effects on both the health of people in the area and the societal infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wildfires are becoming an increasingly potent threat. They're fast, they're dangerous, and they're everywhere. What can we do to take the 'heat' off of those in need?

                    is a website that leverages the HERE.com Maps API to assist local victims of wildfires. By constantly gathering information from MODIS, NASA&rsquo;S Terra satellite, we create real-time location markers based on current forest fires and add them to the map using the HERE.com Maps API clustering algorithm. When the satellite information is updated every hour,

                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge that we faced was gathering location markers for wildfires in real-time, as this meant that the data would have to be parsed every hour. Also, since the data file for global wildfires contains 40,000+ data points, we had to ensure that the parsing algorithm was efficient.

                <p>
                    Another challenge that we faced was writing the algorithm that constantly calculates the distance from the user&rsquo;s location to the closest forest fire to determine whether the user needs to be notified. Once we were able to geocode the user&rsquo;s selected location, we were able to take those coordinates and apply our distance algorithm every hour to see if wildfires were in close proximity.

                    As a team, we were able to code a fully functioning website that is actually ready to be used to help people living in areas prone to forest fires! Not only were we able to implement the HERE.com API seamlessly, but by pairing it with tools like real-time satellite data from NASA and the Google &amp; News APIs, we were able to expand the functionality of

                    is learning how to take advantage of multiple platforms/tools to provide the best user functionality for a singular purpose. Put simply, we realized that by combining relevant APIs, data, and algorithms under a common UI, it is possible to provide almost any functionality.
