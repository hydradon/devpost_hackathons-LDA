                    As women in technology, we wanted to offer players the opportunity to experience the difficult decisions that women have to make throughout their careers. Hopefully, this will help shed light on the lack of representation of women in certain fields.

                    This is a choose-your-own-adventure game implemented as an Android app. It allows the player to pick among 4 fields of study and presents them with situations where they must choose what to do. The situations are designed to help the user see the career path from the perspective of a woman, and get acquainted with the decisions women are frequently faced with.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first mobile app, we decided to use Android Studio to make the development process simpler. After designing the simple user interface and testing that it looked well on our mobile devices, we added the transitions between activities and other logical aspects of the application. We then dedicated some time to debug the issues that were brought up during testing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first experience with Android development, it was to be expected that we encountered some issues. For example, placing variables within a scope that made the control flow more complicated, and dealing with some app crashes because of it. However, after some troubleshooting and thanks to the help of the mentors, we were able to create an app that responded in the way we originally intended it to.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we went out of our comfort zone and tried something new and met success by making the app work and learning a new technology.
