                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a CAD application using VR and finger tracking, for export to 3D printers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some stuff with cubes and spheres - it's actually quite cool but it's definitely no CAD application (just yet)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity and the Leap Motion SDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity cannot be learnt in a few hours (we expected it to be easy!). Also the leap motion documentation is quite bad (the SDK is in beta)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get started but we were consistently blocked by problems with Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finger tracking isn't ready for the primetime yet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oculus Leap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing it! Using Oculus Touch would be better than leap
                </p>
