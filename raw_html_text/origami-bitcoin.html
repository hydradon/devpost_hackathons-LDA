                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a video that is both visually entertaining and informative of why Bitcoin matters. I wanted to focus on 6 major features that Bitcoin provides to its users, which are that Bitcoin is decentralized, it banks the unbanked, it protects identity, it allows microtransactions, it's transparent, and it's a reliable store of value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Construction paper, sharpie, folding, and duct taping my selfie stick to a cardboard box so that I could record the entire video on my phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Premiere Pro for the first time. Fitting everything into 60 seconds!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Origami Bitcoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Origami structures with more than 6 pieces to actually fit all the use cases of Bitcoin!
