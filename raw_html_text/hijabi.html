                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a rise in the hijab fashion space with hijab fashion blogger in the thousands and millions of views and subscriptions on hijab tutorial videos. Seeing this culture develop without there being a central place for hijabis to buy hijabs and use virtualization technology to try them on on their digital device we thought it was the perfect time to take advantage of this opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multi vendor marketplace which allows hijab selling vendors to put their product on our website and gain exposure for their stores and products and provides them an additional stream of revenue.  For the user it saves them the time an hassle of going to hijab stores and trying on hijabs because they can see all the hijabs from different vendors on our platform and try them on using our virtualization technology like snapchat filters.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our prototype we used an open source framework called nopCommerce based on asp.net to give us the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change our idea and refine it several times before finding the one that works best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In one day we were able to think of and build a fully functioning prototype and wrinkle out the details of how we would go about implementing this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how much research and thinking it requires to actually come up with a solution that solves the problem in an effective way and still is sustainable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hijabi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will start work on the final product soon inshallah.
