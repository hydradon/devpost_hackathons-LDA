                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are college students who are constantly looking to study with new students. Often, we also do not have good modes of transportation so being able to find someone who is close to us is beneficial. We figured this would be useful for many students like us so we decided to make this website.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website app that allows you to find people near you based on location, subject preference, and academic level of proficiency.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Firebase, and Google Cloud API. We split up the work with half of our team doing front-end and the other half doing back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the languages we used, we did not have any prior experience. There was a lot of struggles with learning how to use firebase and implementing the google cloud API as documentation on these two resources are very limited. We also ran into problems trying to upload our code to Github as none of us have ever used Github before. There were many problems with trying to implement code and write CSS that would make for a good UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of are actually learning new languages and being able to implement them in a short period of time. Also, we were able to figure out how to store data to a database which we've never done before. Another accomplishment was our ability to make a decent looking website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Firebase, Google Cloud API, and Git. We also learned how to work together as a team and work hard even under great challenges.
