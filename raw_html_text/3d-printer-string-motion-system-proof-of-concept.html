                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team member, Ahmed Amin, was interested in making an alternative option for 3D printers. He proposed an idea to prove that a system similar to the already existing Delta 3D printer can be made with much cheaper materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It demonstrates the idea that you can manipulate a load using 3 motors and some string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino, a breadboard, 3 pulleys, 3 servos, and floss to create a system programmable with the Arduino program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble creating linear motion with the 3 pulley system due to servo inaccuracies. The servos could not accurately spin into the positions we calculated, so we lowered the radius of the pulley wheels and raised the resolution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully showing that a cheap printer may be possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use basic Arduino functions, servos, stepper motors, breadboards, and more advanced pulley systems.
                </p>

                    What's next for 3D Printer String Motion System Proof of Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebuild with a better foundation, and put an extruder system on it. The current cheapest popular 3D printer is $160-$180. A printer with this system may go down to $100.
