                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wondered what a 1v1 between two gods nobody heard of would look? Neither did we but we needed a topic.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a TCG that unlike others does not focus on traditional card play. Instead, the 2 champions fight regardless of the circumstances, the only thing you can do is grant him favours by playing the cards in your hand, sort of like equip cards.
