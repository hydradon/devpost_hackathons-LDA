                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, me and my friends were planning to make a Kerr Black Hole photon trajectory simulation to get a pretty image, which would have been a sick project. However, all of my teammates decided to drop out last minute and I was the only one left out of the group to enroll in this hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had to come up with something on the spot, and I decided to do this machine learning crypto trade instead, which seemed a lot more manageable.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python with whole bunch of known packages!!! It is amazing how much support the python community has for the language and is making amazing APIs!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TensorFlow is written for very specific architectures, so my cpu had difficulty running it. Also, it had collisions with Microsoft c++ redistributable, NVIDIA CUDA drivers, and all sorts of other dlls. I know that TensorFlow is an amazing API but it really was hard to get it compatible. It sort of forced me to use Google Cloud Machine Learning.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    This is my very first time doing machine learning and parsing data through API, this experience allowed me to figure things out on the spot.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Many many APIs and packages! and Google Cloud Computing was exciting!
