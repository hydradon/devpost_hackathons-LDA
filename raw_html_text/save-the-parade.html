                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all interested in designing a game and were all comfortable with python. Due to our common interest in education and games we decided to develop a game that would help students practice a variety of elementary skills. We decided to focus on 2nd graders because we were more aware of what second graders were learning and thought this was a grade level that would appreciate the story we wanted to tell.

                    This program tells a story of a child that helps members of their town prepare for the town parade. Through each interaction the child is tested on various academic skills including common subjects such as math, english, science, and logic.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our common knowledge of coding in python we chose to use a series of modules to craft our game experience. Additionally we imported the turtle module to develop a visual representation of the player's journey. Through the use of these two skills we were able to craft our game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we ran into was choosing an end point for our game. This is because given our time limit we were unsure of just exactly how much content we would be able to both develop and thoroughly edit. Another challenge that we ran into was trying to optimize our code.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group we are proud of completing our game. This is because we felt that it was a great test of our ability to use python. Another achievement that we were proud of was how varied the subject matter was. We felt that this would have a wider appeal to students with different academic interests. We also felt that this section portrays the positive message for students to be active members their community.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is especially crucial to test code more frequently the longer your code spans. We also learned that it is crucial to craft a strategy for both dividing the work load evenly and making the most of the skill your teammates have to offer. This experience allowed us to become more comfortable with seeing different styles when it comes to coding as a team.

                    What's next for Save the Parade!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future developments of our project we hope to implement a save and load feature. Additionally, we would like to improve our graphical portrayal of our story. This will allow for a faster and more accurate portrayal of how the narrative occurs.
