                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .The simple game of treasure hunt played by every kid, should also reflect all the technological developments that have taken place. Incorporating such a change is the use of AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides 7 scaled pictures that need to be found by the user. Once they find the image, they can point the camera and voila! The AR projection comes to life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main platforms were unity and Android SDK. We incorporated the use of vuforia to create the target images and found 3D models that we could import into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was the transmission of data once the image was found.Furthermore, downloading the 3D models resulted in the loss of textures, which had to be recovered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created an app with a complete user-interface and a clean AR projection that the user could hover around to learn more about the 3D object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main achievement is the integration of the user interface and the switching between each scene. We learned more 
C## commands in unity and also learned about debugging in Microsoft visual studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for Augmented Reality Scavenger Hunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To allow the user to upload the images such that their choice of projections can be created on target images of their choice. This is particularly advantageous for Businesses and parents seeking to improve knowledge about their company and teach their children important concepts respectively.
