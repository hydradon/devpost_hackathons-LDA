                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C# needed an actually good vector-matrix library that was up to date with the modern .NET standards.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extends 1D and 2D arrays to act like vectors and matrices.

                    My IDE was pretty but evil.
