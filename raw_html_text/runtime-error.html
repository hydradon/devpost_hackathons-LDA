                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought that the Leap Motion technology was really neat, and wanted to make a unique twist to a classic game style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Runtime Error is an endless runner game using a Leap Motion Infrared device to control the character. Built in Unity, our game allows you to test your hand-eye coordination by dodging objects that come flying at you. Leap Motion allows for the measurement of various hand gestures; it recognizes your hand motions as you form them and then we translated the measurements into movement for the character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion and Unity APIs and modified them to fit into our game. We built the entire 3D runner game from scratch in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to create a github repository but faced difficulty synchronizing our work when we divided up tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all worked really well as a team together, especially considering this was our first hackathon. None of us were experienced in Unity, so it is awesome that we learned so much and feel totally comfortable with it now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is cool, and RedBull is helpful for staying up all night.
                </p>
