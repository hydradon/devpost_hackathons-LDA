                    Students often have to deal with over-weighted backpacks that can cause strain on backs. This aims to fix that by providing a clear way to show how much weight is dangerous for students' backs. Our inspiration came from our own personal experiences. We have all struggled with carrying our books around, especially in middle and high school. We did some research and discovered that some students can end up carrying more than the safe amount when they have an unusually busy day. We hope that with this product we can raise awareness about the issue, and teach students about how much is too much.
