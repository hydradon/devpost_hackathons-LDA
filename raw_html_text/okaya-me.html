                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    40% of the US population has burnout symptoms, becoming the epidemic of the 21st century.  The cost of burnout, time-loss, and presenteism to companies worldwide is over $300B. Not to mention the extremely high societal costs of an over-tired society.
People are getting worst and we want to lead the change.
                </p>

                    We help wellbeing professionals improve their practice and transform patient-outcome by using deep tech, computer vision and machine learning.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Alexa skill is based on the Okaya API.  Unfortunately we still cannot access the video stream on Amazon's devices otherwise we'd be able to replicate the phone-based experience here.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Biggest challenge is not being able to access the video stream.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad to release our app in a Voice-first environment, making it simpler for a greater number of people to better track their energy levels to stay a step ahead of burnout.
We're also proud that thanks to our platform, many wellbeing providers are going to be able to transform patient outcomes and speed up results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice first requires an entirely different mind-set when it comes to the Ux.  But it's also about making sure we provide people with a true cross platform environment so they can keep on getting the results they seek regardless of the platform they are using at this very moment.
