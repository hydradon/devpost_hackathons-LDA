                    The buddy system is used all the time to help people stay safe, but it is not foolproof. It is not uncommon that friends will vow to stick together at the beginning of the night and be on other sides of the town by the end of the night.

                    BuddyMeUp prevents buddies from getting split up and getting hurt by vibrating your phone if a buddy wanders too far away from you. It also features an 'Help' button that allows anyone to alert all of their connected buddies in case of emergency.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app and Java to build the server.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we were not sure how to write the server. We researched and tried many different technologies and we had a lot of difficulty deciding what would be best to use. In the end, we decided to go with what were more comfortable with even if it meant more work.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not use any apis or external libraries to write the server. We were forced dive into more low level problems and really learn more about how servers work.
