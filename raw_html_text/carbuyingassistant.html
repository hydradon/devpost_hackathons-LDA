                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an analyst in the auto industry, I find that there are a lot of questions people ask every day and it will be cool if these questions can be answered automatically by a robot; Amazon lex makes building a robot pretty easy;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Answer common questions about cars, and order one for you if you know which make and model you'd like to buy;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it using Amazon lex, and Amazon lambda function using node.js and some other web scraping technique;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One little problem I found is that it seems the amazon lex seems not being able to capture a phrase more than two words as a slot(maybe I am wrong? I am new to this as well);
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can answer common questions about price and mpg pretty nicely by looking into the official manufacturer's websites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn how to build a chat bot using amazon lex and getting more professional with AWS and node.js
                </p>
