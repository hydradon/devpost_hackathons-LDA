                    We wanted to create an app that helps deaf children communicate better with the world, but sign language is more than just a tool for communication. Scientists found that learning sign language at an early age also helps with brain development and general intelligence in congenitally deaf infants.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We acquired our text-to-sign dictionary from SigningSavvy.com and Handspeak.com, which in total contains more than 8800 words and phrases recorded in American Sign Language. We used PyAudio to stream microphone input and pass it on to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, which converts user speech to text. The text output is then fed into a python script that finds a good match in sign language: if the speech contains a phrase that exists in the dictionary, the phrase is preferred to its components; in this way we can avoid nonsense direct translations to a degree. Finally, the corresponding "translation" is played with a PyQt media player.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had problems deploying the Azure (microphone-)speech-to-text service (Speech SDK) on our laptops, even though the wav-to-text function works fine. After considering the alternative options, for example saving the user speech input as a .wav recording every time, we decided to use PyAudio to stream real-time microphone input and parse it with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

                    What we have so far is a functioning prototype. Next, we want to enlarge our dictionary of sign language recordings, either by finding additional resources or by allowing uploads from sign language users. Second, our current method of generating sign language translations is still far from perfect. We might employ natural language processing techniques to create more accurate, context-dependent translations with linguistic nuances; an alternative would be to recruit fluent sign language users who could "proofread" the content. Finally, we might include illustrations and animations of cartoon characters (in addition to real person recordings) to make the app more appealing to our young users.
