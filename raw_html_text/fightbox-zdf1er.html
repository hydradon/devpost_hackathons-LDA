                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was heavily inspired by the fact that I am a huge MMA/UFC fan. I wanted to make an application that was also unique and something interesting !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially the application uses fighter statistics and through a desktop application allows you to create fantasy pair ups. The application then uses the statistic between these fighters to predict their chance of winning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    The application was built fully in Python
                </p>
