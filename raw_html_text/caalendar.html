                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to solve the problem of scheduling meeting times. Google calendar is another calendar application that can do this, but it can easily get cluttered when you have to managed multiple calendars, give permissions, and share links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets users make accounts and input activities to make a calendar. Then, users can view other user's profiles. User's can also perform a "calendar merge" to merge both calendars to show the common meeting times between the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using python, flask, and mongodb on the back-end. On the front-end we used HTML,CSS,JQuery, and Bootstrap. To render calendars, we used d3.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble using mongodb as it was out first time using a non-relational database. We also had trouble learning flask and sending requests between the front-end and back-end. Additionally, we have problems with pymongo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to have learned mongodb. This was our first time making a web application using python,flask, and mongodb. We are also proud to have overcame the many technical issues with mongo, and proud to have learned a lot of new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Caalendar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few new features to add. Users should be able to add friends, have multiple calendars, and possibly chat with other users. It is more of a social media experience than other calendar apps such as Google calendar or WhenToMeet.
