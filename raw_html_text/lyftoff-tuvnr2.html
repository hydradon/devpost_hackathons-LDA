                <p>
                    Inspired by the necessary wait when requesting a Lyft at airports, we seek to improve the ride-hailing experience such that flyers will have their transportation ready when they arrive at the pick-up point, instead of having to wait for a while, and the option to conveniently request a Lyft during check-in. The product we are proposing will request flyers to pre-book their transportation during check-in, and then will set flyers worry-free. Like,
                    <em>
                        worry free
                    </em>
                    . We pool the Lyfts to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though conventional ride-sharing requests would require flyers to be present on the pick-up point on time, our algorithm empowers flyers to have the freedom to be late when necessary--say, due to baggage delays or need to use the restroom. Our algorithm relies on pooling the Lyfts and, instead of assigning the driver with the flyer during dispatch, the assignment is made a few minutes before the flyer reaches the pick-up point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a flyer happens to have luggage issues that requires an hour to solve, the flyer does not need to cancel the rideshare request; instead, the driver who otherwise would have to wait for an hour or cancel will be assigned to another person seeking rideshare through Delta, and the big size of the pool will mitigate this issue to the point that the issue is negligible; the flyer with luggage issues can have a punctual ride with peace in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that our approach to pooling ridesharing is beneficial in increasing customer satisfaction, and should seem to look magical to those who don't know how the algorithm can support timeliness despite of freedom in individual delays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm provides a verbose analysis output, a simple visualization, and some mobile app UI mockup.
