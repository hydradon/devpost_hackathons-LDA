                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Price comparers are slow to use when you have to type in everything, so we developed a solution using image tagging to solve this problem by cutting out that step.  Through doing this, Shopsea also finds a wider range of products that may also interest the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a user to find related items to one in front of them via image recognition tagging and their prices / postings in online retailers.  This lets people gauge if the item they are looking at is reasonably priced and may show a better alternative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shopsea uses a node.js web server hosted on Heroku to interface with the Clarifai and Prosperent APIs for image tagging and retailer searching, respectively.  Since it is a mobile-first web application, it can be easily accessed and used across all devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the APIs was finicky at times and hosting a server live on Heroku instead of a local machine was interesting.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
