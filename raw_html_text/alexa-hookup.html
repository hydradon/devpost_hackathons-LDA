                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Job searches are complicated for the employers and applicants.  Employers should be able to easily sort through the many resumes given to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Amazon Web Services to implement a chat bot with the Amazon Echo application.  Asking simple questions, like "Alexa, find someone with five years of coding experience," will list fitting responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming Alexa was difficult.  Our team had very limited coding experience, but with our diverse array of talents we overcame our challenges and completed our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team, consisting of four strangers, came together and had a great time getting to know each other and enjoying Ram Hacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides programming Alexa with AWS, we learned how to persevere and not give up when the code fails, because there's always a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlexaHookup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to turn Alexa Hookup into a mobile app to make our service more readily available for applicants and employers.
