                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that in the near future technology will have tremendous insight into our lives. We wanted to demonstrate a high-impact application of AI that has the potential to greatly impact people around the world with existing technology.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    joyOS uses neural networks to predict your second-by-second emotional reactions based on the video feed from your computer's webcam. joyOS logs your emotions to help you understand your emotional state and what content/apps make you happier. It also tracks your smiles and prompts you to smile more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV to detect faces that are within a reasonable viewing distance of a computer webcam. Next, we used a neural network trained on tens of thousands of faces to predict facial expressions on a moment-by-moment basis. Finally, we display a video feed of our live emotion recognition in a web browser using the Flask web framework. We record the user's emotion information for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates had to leave the hackathon early due to family reasons. We experienced great difficulty using Flask together with TensorFlow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy we were able to get emotion detection working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about computer vision, neural networks, and happiness :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for joyOS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are evaluating releasing a JavaScript app that can scalably run client-side emotion recognition.
