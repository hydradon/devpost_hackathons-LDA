                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dyslexic individuals often have trouble with learning to read. We developed our web app "Dyslexic Reading" in order to combat this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dyslexic reading is an educational website which helps you read along with a story using text-to-speech and highlighting of text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three components: the WebScraper for short stories, audio file generator, and the actual web service.
We first webscraped various stories from websites online, and split each story into an array of sentences. We passed each sentence through the google cloud text-to-speech API to get MP3 files for the story. The story is dynamically generated in the website. Then, the website highlights each sentence as it is read by the MP3 file so that it is easier for the reader to follow along.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our challenges was that some of us were inexperienced with web development so we had to learn node and ejs on the fly while we tried to implement a working website. This especially became a problem when we confused the back-end and front-end functions so we had to rewrite much of our code later on.
Another challenge was the asynchronous errors we were getting. When we were trying to play the audio, we tried to run a play-audio function for each sentence but that just caused all the sentences to play at once which resulted in a jumbled mess. We had to figure out various strategies from asynchronous programming in order to fix this.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we created a website which helps dyslexic people read.
We were able to get the website working with our major functionalities working properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us learned web development for the first time so we learned a lot about the entire process of making a web app. We also learned how to use the google cloud api and incorporate it into our project.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we were not able to upload our website to a domain due to problems in domain.com, we can host our website so others can access the website.
