                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My relative has had multiple breaches of his data, which has cost him losses in the ranges of the thousands of dollars. 
I would like to make sure that no one else has to go through that horrible experience, hence we are creating this project to inform the general populace on how to better protect their data.
