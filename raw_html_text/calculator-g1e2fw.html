                    We were inspired to do this because we wanted to get better at coding. We learned about functions and we built this by defining variables to be the numbers and add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Since we couldn't put in all the numbers in the world, we used the input so the person using it could enter the  numbers. We put in float so we could add, subtract, multiply and divide decimals and whole numbers.
