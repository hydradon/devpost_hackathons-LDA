                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shark week is coming up and we wanted to create an experience where users could interact with sharks in VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where users swim to dodge 3 dimensional sharks and get a score based on how long they survive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built in Aframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rendering new levels and objects proved challenging. We had to rebuild the game differently to capture the intended experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the 3d positioning of all the elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create products in aframe.

                <p>
                    We're going to put up a new and improved version for shark week!
