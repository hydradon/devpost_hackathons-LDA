                    As a hacker, a staple part of the hackathon experience is finding teammates and creating a team. More often than not, finding and or creating a team is a difficult task as suitable teammates are scarce and usually taken. With such an annoying problem, we knew that there must be an easier way to recruit team members. As we realized how big of a problem this was for everyone; an idea was born, and TeamJoin.me was created. TeamJoin.me is a mobile application designed to ease the team recruitment process. Running on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, users are able to filter through a database of hackers and find potential partners to share their grand prize with. With filters such as programming languages, programming positions, age, experience, and more, finding your ideal team mates is no longer the excruciating burden it once was. By clearing up your schedule, you will have more time to hack and reach your goal.
