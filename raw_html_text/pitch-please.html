                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always emphasize finishing our hack a little early to practice our pitch in order to deliver our hard work as effectively as possible. After attending the VoiceFlow workshop, we were inspired by the functionality and wanted to utilize it to help all hackers ace their pitches using a voice assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes the words used in your pitch, looks for specific filler words, as well as calculating the words per minute rate of the speech and compares it to the average speaking pace for a speech. The voice assistant then relays the feedback immediately to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used VoiceFlow along with Javascript code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa stops listening after a certain amount of continuous talking, so we had to switch to Google Assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge to calculate the words per minute within VoiceFlow, however, their ability to insert javascript code into the app helped us achieve this function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript and VoiceFlow

                    What's next for Pitch Please
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to utilize machine learning to recognize words within a context and identify if it really is a filler word or no, as well as learning different speach patterns which make great presentations.
