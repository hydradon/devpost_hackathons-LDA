                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by discrete mathematics and the accessibility of IFTTT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WANN takes data from Twitter, Reddit, and can be fed information locally. It then forms any data it has into a Neural Network with which it can then return sensible data off of what it knows. In this case, WANN is given English, and it returns English!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WANN is built in python, and is made to go online and collect data. This may make it seem like it needs somewhere to be hosted, but it doesn't need a dedicated host. WANN can be deployed from any device and gets all of it's data from what other people have written.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The second part of WANN is to introduce a linguistics analysis system. Finding good and large sources information for WANN to parse is rather hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to see WANN learning, and writing it's own tweets!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot about how things can be connected on many levels, and I have learned a lot about applications of discrete mathematics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wirelessly Accessible Neural Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relevance sensory. WANN will be able to collect information form a set of connected sentences to understand things like conversation subject and even research its own information on current events.
