                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we need a package delivered within a very short period of time and don't have the time or budget to send an express/same-day package via post.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beelivery allows everyday drivers who are anyways driving between cities to post their routes, and take packages with them in exchange for a fee. Drivers can upload their routes, where users can request for them to bring a package along.  This way, if you need a package delivered this afternoon, you can search for drivers "Deliverbees" which are heading to the destination fo your package anyways! Once a driver (Deilverbee) begins his or her route, they can use the in-app navigation module with help of the TomTom API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build Beelivery as a native Android Application, using Firebase as a backend as well as a content storage bucket. Beelivery requires Maps, Address queries as well as GPS routing, so we integrated the TomTom Maps and Routing API to help Beelivery achieve its purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was planning the most essentials use-cases in the app given the time constraints. We also spend a decent amount of time trying to understand the GPS navigation setup with the TomTom API, which was actually really exciting, as the API was very well documented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to accomplish a nearly fully functional app. The only section we were not able to include due to time constraints is including a Stripe payment system for the users and drivers (Deliverbees).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot about Location technology by utilizing the TomTom API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beelivery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Beelivery are to extend the Driver route and package info, by including images and package weight details. Beelivery will also be using the Stripe payment platform to handle payouts to the independent drivers.
