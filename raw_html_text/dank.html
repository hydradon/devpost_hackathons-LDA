                    We all know that one guy who keeps telling your group to watch X movie.
You watch X movie, and its absolute trash. Like you expected.
This happens over and over. How can you low key ignore his inout, without seeming rude?

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maintains internal state of who was championing the movie from the get-go, and how the group's movie perception changed over time. Uses math and stuff to take this
                    <code>
                        delta_dank
                    </code>
                    and use it to update each member's
                    <code>
                        value_as_a_person
                    </code>
                    , which determines how much their input is weighted.
