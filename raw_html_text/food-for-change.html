                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roughly 30% of food from production is wasted each year. We wanted to find a way to discourage food waste by targeting some of the largest culprits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application requests food nearing the end of its shelf life from grocery stores. From here, the grocery stores can scan food they wish to donate, and a tax form will be generated. After their submission, a Lyft driver will transport the donations to a nearby food bank. The data scanned from the grocery store is inputted into an inventory system for the food bank. Following the delivery, a text notification is sent to local residents using the app that food is available for pickup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS to incorporate a user sign in system. Then we created a QR code scanner through php and flutter that links to our website. The scanned items go into a data base made through mySQL. We created a text notification system through Twilio to notify users when food is ready to be picked up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we attempted to construct the majority of the project using aws. However, we lacked experience with the service. We resolved this issue by seeking advice from the aws representatives and creating our project on multiple platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we could incorporate several different servers that are capable of working together. In addition, implementing a working QR code scanner was a major success. Finally, we are excited to have created an application that will help fix a large issue in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are better acquainted with the aws software. Without attending the Hackathon, learning this task would have seemed to daunting to undertake. Personally, I increased my skills with git.
                </p>

                    What's next for Food For Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make Food For Change more stable and applicable to stores all over the world.
