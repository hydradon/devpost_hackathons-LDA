                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> When we think about safe and sustain LA, what can we do?
    One thing came up is all homeless people out here, what can we do to help them? Moreover, not just them, people also struggling in real life. A single parent that works so hard but get laid off. Things happen, yet what can we do to help? Quick money to cover up life situation. 
 Hustle creates an environment that people can post what kind of help they need and payment amount. The user can set up a range to show all current available quick job to do. 
 When people have enough money for living, the crime rate would decrease. And for people need help, their problem would be resolved. Aim for LA to have a safer environment. Sustain human power, instead of waiting for new job interviews by doing nothing. The evolutionary way of working or quick money.

    Quick help for people in need, either need a research project help, moving help, etc...
 In order for people in need of money to get money in the right ways. Sustain human power at the same time. A new evolutionary way for working.
