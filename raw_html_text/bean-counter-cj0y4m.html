                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On weekends my kids and I would practice simple math by adding and subtracting groups of coffee beans. For some reason they associated the coffee beans with their father so they called them "Daddy Beans".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill will allow you to take simple math quizzes and keep track of your score as you go along.  For every successful quiz users are awarded points which can eventually increase their level.  With each level increase the questions will become progressively harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is built in a Serverless environment using Node.js running on Lamba storing data to DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to use a slot type of number Alexa can become very confused when kids are trying to answer.  There responses were often parsed incorrectly.  I used a custom slot type instead limiting the possible answers to as few as possible for more predictable results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the skill to run on the Alexa show as well as implementing multiple levels of difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to craft an interactive skill for the Alexa show.  I can be challenging to structure the skill in order to make it easy for kids to use.

                    Adding more skill levels and content.
