                    We wanted to help nurses in the field by reminding them the facts about certain situations that are uncommon or rarely encountered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our skill will tell the nurse facts about Smoke Inhalation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our limited knowledge we used amazon's skill blueprint and the knowledge of a student that is studying in the medical field to build out skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believed finding the credible information that would be helpful to the nurse was our biggest challenge as well as coding with limited time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the basic skill we created especially at our level in know how to code with Alexa skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned about the process of creating an Alexa skill and the potential it has on different applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the skill works out, we would like to improve on the skill by taking more time to make the main feature more defined and custom to the skill we envisioned to create.
