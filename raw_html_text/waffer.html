                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the people are on budgets, so to help them maintain the budget they are following we made this app to reduce their power consumption resulting in reducing the bill amount they have to pay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it helps the user to balance their electricity usage, water usage and also when it doesn't need to use high amount of electricity we can change to Eco-mode; which allows user to have control over the electric devices and water pressure, and if user is travelling we can switch to Travel-mode; which basically turns off the power of the house except the required devices like refrigerator, and in case of no internet access to the user, he can give one-time access code to his neighbor to enable the travel mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    we couldn't find a solution to reduce power consumption when it changes to low power mode without adding new devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
