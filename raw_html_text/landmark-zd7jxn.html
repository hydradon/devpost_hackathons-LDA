                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my high school, the internet connection speed is terribly slow, but the LAN connection is acceptable. This is the case for a lot of places, of OK LAN but poor Wi-fi coverage. Node.js allows a file server to be hosted on a PC/Mac/Linux machine. I have made a simple file server before, so when people all need to download some large files at the same time, they can download from my laptop at speeds higher than normal after I download it. I put installers of apps required by the school in that folder so that they can be easily accessible in my vicinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this is not enough. Not only did the old program support no more than file download, but the user would also actually have to remember and input a super-long tedious URL. This project is building another platform independent of the previous one to achieve higher capacity, allowing file directory browsing (with folder collapse), file download, file upload, and a file hub function called "peripheral" (in beta, explained later).

                    Peripheral &ndash; WHAT THE HECK?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Peripheral is a feature that allows file uploads to bypass host inspection and directly be accessible by the public on the same LAN. Its primary goal is "one installation, multi-direction transfer" &ndash;&nbsp;that is to say, turning the host's computer into a file hub for
                    <em>
                        temporary
                    </em>
                    file storage and
                    <em>
                        limited
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        directed
                    </em>
                    sharing. I named it Peripheral because it goes around the filter and folder separation at the center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With peripheral, once I launch my LANdmark, other people will be able to perform high-speed file sharing over the LAN through my machine, with the files deleted from the host after a certain delay or after a specific number of downloads (both specified, whichever occurs earlier). This would certainly lower the security measures by a limited amount, but the host will greatly help other people in the area to perform direct file sharing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a temporary file hub, all files in Peripheral will be deleted on relaunching the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peripheral is currently under beta. At the time this sentence is composed, auto-delete is being developed.

                    Wanna hear the story?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I started off rebuilding a directory-browsing server (
                    <code>
                        src/server/index.js
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        src/server/explorer.js
                    </code>
                    ) and webpage (
                    <code>
                        src/client/html/index.html
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        src/client/index.js
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        src/client/components.js
                    </code>
                    ). I did the JSON directory tree first, and then the whole thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I added directory collapse and file download. I tested it out on a friend's computer. But I was serving a video and it opened in a new tab instead of being downloaded, so I added a second link &ndash;&nbsp;the first one for preview, the second one for actual download.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I moved onto file upload. The client-side is easy: you basically just make a form send it. The server-side is a mess: I made many stupid mistakes, and there are limitations on the framework Multer. I linked the two webpages with hyperlinks after I finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 3 a.m., I moved onto Peripheral. It basically inherits a lot of the stuff from the file explorer, downloader and uploader (because it needs to do all these, only probably not to such an extent). So there was a bunch of Cmd-C Cmd-V from one of my files to another, as well as continuous debugging to solve the compatibility issues and account for new features. By the time this sentence is composed, I'm adding socket.io communication to the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging something within a framework was a frustrating experience. The codes are all wrapped up, so what you see in the console isn't what you've been working on, especially after running Webpack and a JS minifier. What's most important, it hides many apparent errors from you and makes you think that it's a problem with using the frameworks' APIs when you simply mistyped
                    <code>
                        { files: [] }
                    </code>
                    as
                    <code>
                        { files = [] }
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another notable challenge is to coordinate the crazy async-ness of Node.js, especially when you recursively call async methods in a normal
                    <code>
                        dirWalk
                    </code>
                    . Custom Events saved the day, eventually.
