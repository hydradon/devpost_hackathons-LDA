                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bulk of the project utilized Firestore technology to store and share data across multiple devices. This was done through sharing new lines over the database, then redrawing them on other device to keep them in sync. From here UI improvements were made to make user experience more satisfying.
