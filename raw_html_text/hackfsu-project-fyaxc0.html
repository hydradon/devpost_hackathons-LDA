                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To see a world more connected. To see a generation of kids dominated social media and other socially isolating technologies start to use technology to bring us together instead of farther apart
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gethr uses GPS positioning to locate people nearby that have similar  interests and places them on a map with a fixed radius (dependent on the user). After they select a person, group or event to participate in Gethr offers them directions to the location and a notification to remind them of the agreed meet up time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scope of the overall project was too large for this hackathon so we dedicated our time towards creating templates which could give a better idea of what we'd like the app to look a bit more like in the future. The web side was built in HTML, CSS and JS and the mock-up design for the web app was created using Adobe Photoshop CS6. Version control was done via git
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our largest challenges was definitely getting everyone properly connected to the same repo. With a few tweaks everything with it was handled. Other challenges definitely included disagreements with the name and image of the project though we were able to tackle the issue in a civil matter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functioning prototype that we didn't expect to finish in time
                </p>

                    What we learned
