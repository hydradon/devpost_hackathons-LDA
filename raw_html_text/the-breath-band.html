                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group members is an EMT.  He has seen and experienced many challenges taking simple vital signs in the back of an ambulance.  Our mission is to eliminate human error, and speed up the process of taking breath rates so that time isn't wasted taking vitals, when it could be spent saving lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our band measures the expansion and contraction of your diaphragm/ribs.  By measuring this displacement, we can measure resistivity and calculate the breath rate of a person.  If the rate is too low or too high, our app will notify the medical staff caring for the patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python and Xcode, we were able to put together an app where you can input data, and see a graph and results.  We did not have the materials to build the actual band; however, we have data to simulate a healthy and a sick patient (displayed on the app).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our group members have a computer science background, so there was many challenges in creating the code! Many thanks to the mentors available and to google! :)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to put an idea together in just a mere 36 hours! Who knew something that started on a scrap piece of paper can one day save so many lives!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned so much about coding as well as how to work in a team setting.  It was nice to be able to bounce ideas off of one another as well as use each of our background knowledge to create our final product! Teamwork makes the dreamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Breath Band
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to see the Breath Band used by EMT's, hospitals and consumers! There are many applications for this product and we hope to see the quality of care increase to patients, as well as a reduction of human error.  We believe that patients with breathing abnormalities could benefit greatly from this product.
