                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What can we do to notify paramedics of domestic medical emergencies at the point it happens? For senior citizens, the highest risk is involuntary tripping and mortally injuring themselves, often undiscovered for hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FallWatch is an Apple Watch app that detects sudden trips/accidents and triggers preset alarms via the phone, so that text messages are sent to predefined emergency contacts without needing user intervention
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the accelerometer and the gyrometer to detect sudden changes in the acceleration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncronization between the Watch and the Iphone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the Watch API and using it over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncronization is the key to a successful watch app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FallWatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fallwatch can be extended to detect fall accidents while doing activities like outdoor biking, hiking and mountaineering.
                </p>
