                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Student safety is a large concern at a campus that is as large as the University of Washington.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application to visualize crime incident data around the UW campus area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SpotCrime public API for crime incident data and compiled it into a heat map using the Google Map API within Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Kotlin and how to work with the Android SDK, how to make HTTP request to spotcrime API, how to work with Google Map API .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came in with virtually no knowledge of how to code an Android application and we were able to create a working application. Although we were unable to incorporate all of the features we planned for, we are satisfied with our progress in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Kotlin, developing in Android Studio, and GitHub etiquette.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dubhacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to apply our data visualization further in order to increase safety for students and to notify students of areas of historically high incident rates.
