                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that in our daily lives, we don't think much about giving to charity. By making it a part of something we do often--like shopping on Amazon--we not only bring greater awareness to people in need but also help them with donations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever people make a purchase on Amazon, they can opt to donate a percent of their purchase to their charity of choice. This way, they can factor this donation into being part of their overall purchase and hence budget.
