                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our main inspirations for this project is the lack of readily available access to recipes and difficulty in meal planning. Most of our team members were university students who struggled with meal planning and most often relied on quick, cheap, ready-made food that was often unhealthy for them. We decided to create this website to help people figure out in a simple and intuitive manner what they want to eat, and plan when they want to eat it!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows you to plan weeks in advance using a storage of easy-to-make recipes that are easily accessible for the user. Ideally, users will be able to search through dozens of different recipes, favorite them, and then add it to a scalable weekly calendar.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step One: Collected a database of recipes from AllRecipes.com, as well as the level of difficulty and time to make it
Step Two: Split up into a front-end and a back-end team, with front-end designers working primarily on user experience and physical aesthetic of the website, and back-end developers working on the various functionalities like Meal Planning, Shopping List, a search bar that runs through the database of 
This simple yet intuitive website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into were being able to implement as many of our ideas in such a short time slot. There was a lot of trying things out, failing, then revising the original plan that went down. Getting a functional calendar view and allowing users to add their meals to selected days was one of the biggest challenges, and in the end it ultimately came down to a week by week view, with a button that allows users to plan meals consecutive to the previous. This allowed us to present a proof of concept type of product, which may later be expanded on and further revised beyond the scope of DeltaHacks.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the seamless design of the website. We believe we really nailed user experience and created an interface that is easy to navigate and pleasant on the eyes! In terms of back-end we are incredibly proud of our sleek programming and troubleshooting. We were able to implement a searching feature as well as a weekly calendar feature that relies on localhost storage to refresh itself with new information.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to implement various Javascript-based objects that helped to create a simple and sleek website. We also learned about the importance of time management and divying up the work as we would not have been able to accomplish this project without everyone working their hardest. Furthermore, we also got to experiment with new software (such as Firebase and Google Authentication) during the initial phase of our development.

                    What's next for MyMeal Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the ways we plan to expan MyMeal Space is by adding a login/sign-up page so that it can track the choices individuals make alongside their various preferences for recipes. We would also like to improve our calendar system so that it has a much more reactive, graphical user interface. We would also add a function where the user can implement and add their own recipes and keep stock of them in their profile. We would also hope to make it community-accessible by giving members access to other user reviews and allow members to connect with each other via their recipe preferences. We would also transfer our data and store it into a proper database which would use a web scraper to grab recipes from websites and make it easily accessible for the user.
