                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game that is simplistic yet entertaining. We used many simple popular games as inspiration, which helped us not incorporate too many rules. We also used many arcade games as inspiration, because we chose to make our game an arcade style game with 2 objectives; to gain coins and to go the farthest distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an arcade game for android, where the character is an astronaut that has to go the farthest distance while still collecting coins.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used photoshop to create some the home screen images, however most of the graphics were just clip art. We used another program called buildbox to construct our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a lack of sleep, changing our idea, and last minute changes. This was also our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a running android app in a short amount of time, and this was a completely new experience for one of our group members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to efficiently manage time, and we gained more experience building apps
                </p>

                    We plan on making more levels, and putting it on the Play store
