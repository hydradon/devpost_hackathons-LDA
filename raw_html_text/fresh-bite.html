                <p>
                    While Fresh Bite helps eliminate food waste by providing a well-portioned meal plan to help you get rid of those on-sale groceries you bought in bulk, it also provides a cost-effective solution for lower-income families.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By planning out meals based on the expiration dates of the ingredients, Fresh Bite ensures that your money is well-spent and nothing has to go to waste. It's a win-win scenario.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We try to connect Clarifai food recognition API and food2fork recipe search API to deliver a smart picture-to-recipe planner. We used HTML/CSS for frontend development and Node.js/HTML/Express framework for backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not very familiar with web development languages and APIs, so it took us a while to pick up those languages and understand how things work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of/ What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned web development on the spot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fresh Bite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide more information about freshness of the groceries and their expiry dates through image recognition and NLP, and build our own customer information database and recipe API.
