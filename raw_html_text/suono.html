                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're two teenagers that both love music, and we've both had this issue before! We found that Shazam was an incredibly useful tool but only if a desired song was currently playing in its full form. We made a tool that can identify those great songs that you can't name with just a simple hum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Record audio into the website interface, either by humming or by tapping a rhythm (less accurate, hopefully for obvious reasons), and our machine learning algorithm will try to figure out which song it was!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python for all of the back-end machine learning/grunt work. We created a website instead of a traditional application so we used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front-end work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As expected, nothing worked the first time we did it. We had a surprising amount of front-end issues, a lot of which rendered the program useless at times.
                </p>
