                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming out of a frustration with the status quo when it comes to gym training, and the zeal to more closely analyse athletic progress, thermal analysis of muscle groups quickly became the most meaningful project to pursue. It's feasibility, and large potential markets are also large motivating factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows a user to monitor and analyse the temperatures of muscle groups during a workout to gain insight on possible issues with form, muscle imbalances, insufficient warmup, and a plethora of other traits that are all synthesised by a server into a single blurb that gives the user a rundown of their performance, weak points, strong points, possible imbalances, and routines to work on their weak points
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app was built on top of the FLIR ONE SDK, in Objective-C, and we built the server in the Go Language, backed by a SQL database- all hosted on Amazon Web Services. All of the analysis and synthesis is performed 100% server-side, reducing strain on the mobile device, and allowing for a much faster development cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the team wasn't very familiar with thermal imaging, even more so the FLIR ONE, they were able to surmount the learning curve fairly quickly, and are thankful to the FLIR team for helping to get them going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is definitely most proud of how they were able to quickly build a lean prototype and pitch, that was largely based on technology that the team had little to no experience with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team learned a lot about thermal imaging, image processing, and developing in a lean setup, under stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MusculoTherm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MusculoTherm team hopes refine the user experience, add certain features that we believe are lacking, and bring this to the App Store.
