                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often come across a lot of plain tabulated data in websites and it is hard to get meaningful insights by plainly looking at them. We wanted an easy way to quickly generate insights from tables and present before the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a Chrome plugin tool that automatically detects tabulated information in a website and offers a button. Tapping on the button would launch a playground with insights that our engine generates. Additionally, the playground also provides a voice interface powered by Amazon Alexa to which the user can ask questions pertinent to the data in the table, and Alexa can respond with responses. This makes it easy for users to get friendly responses to their questions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, Alexa. Data sourced from Techcrunch/Crunchbase.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally started out building a website builder powered by Alexa, and halfway through the process (at 9.30pm) learned that it was already built by the Techcrunch Disrupt NY winner! While we felt good to have thought about an idea that won the grand prize, we decided to pivot to try something new :)

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to pivot to a new idea and executed it in about 8 hours.
