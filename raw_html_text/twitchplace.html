                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a Twitch extension as soon as they cam out, and I really enjoyed the Reddit social experiment on /r/Place, so I thought why not combine the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a grid in a Twitch channel's description and allows viewers to drag and drop colored tiles to create icons/images, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Twitch Extension Boilerplate repo for development and the Muxy Extensions SDK for managing state and handling the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very little documentation around extensions in general, Twitch has a manual review process so there was no way to completely finish the extension and publish it. The best I could get to was having it run locally on my machine and having to whitelist any usernames for testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a solid product that might actually get used if I can finish the entire extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you know how a library works, your life will be much easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TwitchPlace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll continue developing the extension, hopefully I'll have enough time to finish it.
                </p>
