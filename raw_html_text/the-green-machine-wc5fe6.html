                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In an effort to build off of the concepts of functional modernism and minimalism, we saw an oppertunity within an environmentally-relevant market for a product that prioritizes sustainability over profits. Our vision was derived from smart thermostat companies like Nest and Ecobee who advocate for energy conservation at the expense of high consumer cost and maintainence. Time and time again, these industry leaders exploit residential and commercial clients for profit, as opposed tto making the product more affordable to drive the environmental benefits of the product to a broader customer base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rohe was thoughtfully designed to be an affordable smart thermostat that prioritizes environmental sustainability and consumer accessibility over profits. To reduce the commonly unaffordable price tag attatched to smart thermostats filled with bells and wistles, we were able to offer a smart thermostat that is projected to surpass efficiency performance tests, while maintaining a modest retail value. Rohe eliminates the need for a digital interface by utilizing an embedded WiFi chip that offers accurate indoor location fixes, thus boosting energy efficiency and cutting costs drastically for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rohe's initial rudiments and structures came with many logistical challenges. Coming up with a cost-effective design while still supplying consumers with services allowing for energy conservations prompted us to deep dive on the internal elements of current day thermostats. Following in-depth analysis, our group made a minimalistic, yet effective thermostat that accomplished what market leaders boasted without an unecessary, un-economic cost.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that utilities that are in favor of a reduced carbon footprint and enviornmental conservation do not have to break the bank, so to speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rohe aims to be a pioneer in the field of affordable and effective environmental sustainability; a distinctively practical solution.
