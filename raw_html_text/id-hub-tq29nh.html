                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our inspiration from personal experiences with bureaucratic agencies where notarized documents are needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we wanted to accomplish is to create a PoA (Proof of Authority) token used for payments of documents and notarization. Our idea is to build an API that allows government authorities or organizations which are in the positions of issuing those documents to provide them in a decentralized way upon users' requests.
Our idea for choosing PoA consensus is that the validators can be trusted institutions. For example, if a user needs a digital version of an ID, he/she will request the appropriate agency for the document and pay for that notary service using our token (PI coin - Personal Identification Coin). The agency has the authority to validate the said document. In this way, it is not the user who puts the document on the blockchain, but an institution or trusted agency.  Once the user has a binding cryptographic document, he/she can send it to desired parties through the blockchain.
In our ID hub app, we included four document type categories: Traveling Documents, Health Records, Education Records and Financial Records. In each, the user will have the option to add the associated institutions; for example, in Education Records, the user may add their undergraduate schools, and the documents that were created or issued by those schools will be listed. The user may then check the desired documents from the list, and request them through the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is a proof of concept which is still in progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used solidity to write the token contract, and deployed it in both Ethereum test net and POA test net (sokol).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning everything from scratch related to blockchain and downloading all the required packages and software with the limited internet during the whole weekend. Limited resources and tutorial videos from the platforms we were attempting to use was a major challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to deploy our coin (PIC) on the test networks and transfer them to our metamask and parity wallets. We also built a user interface for our app (ID hub) as proof of concept to explain the bigger scheme we were planning to achieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new language (solidity), how to write smart contracts, and familiarized ourselves with different frameworks and platforms widely used in blockchain technology. We learned about many projects and companies we hadn't heard of before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ID Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to successfully deploy and launch a test of our smart contract using PoA network and successfully develop our intended API.
