                    How many times have you and your significant other bee indecisive about what you're eating that night? Why argue and choose when Grub Runner can choose for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the click of a button, some random delivery person will show up to your home with random food from some random place. You better hope you like it too, because by that time you've already paid for it! Impractical, risky, and somewhat stupid, Grub Runner makes difficult decisions quickly and gets you food quickly- but it won't tell you what kind!
