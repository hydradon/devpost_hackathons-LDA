                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Uncle Ruckus is a very nonchalant man usually, but when I mentioned barcodes to him, he flipped.  Every time him and Aunt Suzy were out shopping and needed to send barcodes back to their friends at the senior home they were distraught by having to open too many apps.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detects barcode and prints to current focused textbox (not working)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio and magic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detecting barcode from bitmap, moving camera preview into keyboard layout (not complete)
                </p>

                    Who knows? Maybe we will fund a mission to Mars with the money we make from sales.
