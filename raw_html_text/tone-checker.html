                </h2>
                <p>
                    IBM challenge, To write a program that reads a text and exhibits perceived emotion. To be used with official documentation such as cover letters, letter of withdrawal, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads a text and highlights the text a certain color depending on the perceived emotion, and hovering over a certain sentence will pop up a label giving the "value of emotion (0.0-1.0)" and the emotion itself.
 ## How I built it
We used the IBM Watson api for the emotion reading, and JavaFX for the GUI.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can into several graphical bugs with the display (particularly with the tooltips on the sentences), as well as some issues deciding on the language and converting the Json files into Java objects properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we actually managed to finish what we set out to do on time (despite oversleeping!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interact with the Watson API to get access to all of its innovative features. We will probably be using some of their services in future products that do not need to be written at 5am!

                    What's next for Tone Checker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If anything it will be sprucing up the interface to make it a bit more pleasant to look at.
