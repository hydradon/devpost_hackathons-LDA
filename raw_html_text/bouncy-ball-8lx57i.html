                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to submit something after my initial idea didn't work out. I decided to make a very simple game using a tool I learned during my freshman year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It bounces a ball off a bar to keep it from falling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote a program in Processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remembering what I learned from freshman year and figuring out a plan B.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I completed something!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about Node.js and web-based app development although I didn't use those tools. I also re-learned processing and am excited to use it in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bouncy Ball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make it better, it's really simple right now but I can improve it to make it more challenging for users.
