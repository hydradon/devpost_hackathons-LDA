                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this project came from a very disturbing and unsettling nightmare I once had. I was lost and stuck wandering a hallway lined with doors that continued for eternity, and unspeakable horrors were hidden behind each one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an entertaining game demo, and will be sure to spook everyone who gives it a try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized the Unity3D 5 game engine. I constructed and textured all of the 3D models, wrote all of the code, anddesigned the game and its interface all by myself. I used some royalty free music from the internet labeled as fair use content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of workforce was my biggest obstacle as I took on this project alone. I still learned a lot throughout this Hackathon, and would love to assemble a team beforehand for another project next year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game demo runs, and I was able to do it without any outside help
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of beginner Java and C++
                </p>

                    What's next for The Darkest Door

                <p>
                    I wish to complete this project in the future.
