                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have an interest in the financial industry, and we thought this would be a really cool platform to make something that combines our interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A web application that uses sentiment analysis and NLP to determine why stocks acted the way they did on a specific time (determined by the user).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend. Along with that we used several Python APIs to mine data form the internet as well as to get the sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a steep learning curve with the JS APIs. None of us had used it in depth earlier, so it was quite an experience getting the hang of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to set up the server properly, and had a near-perfect front-end. Our graphing looks dope, and we were able our hypothesis on what news said and how the stocks reacted was pretty much confirmed by the sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about web development (setting up a server and hosting multiple clients), sentiment analysis and ML, and parsing JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockWise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to apply more forms of AI and transition the application to also try and predict stocks based on past news and common traits during different intervals.
