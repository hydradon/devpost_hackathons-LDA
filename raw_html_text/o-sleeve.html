                <p>
                    The modern orthopedic cast design has been used for centuries without major change, yet the research shows it is still far from optimizing this basic medical device. While supplement devices, such as splints, have made their way into the market to aid the fracture healing process, the cast still plays a vital role in the recovery process for most patients. The most commonly used types of cast cause many secondary injuries, as the skills of the applier are a critical necessity to ensure that the patient heals properly. It is essential to prioritize current setbacks of the modern cast to properly create a plan of innovation. With technology developing rapidly, the use of 3D printers and scanners may revolutionize the orthopedic casts we are familiar with, for one which optimizes the child patient&rsquo;s experience and decreases the healing
process duration. But, these casts have one major setback, the availability, and price of 3D printing a personalized cast. That is where our design comes in. We have created a first stage prototype, with data and research to support our design. The design provides similar results as a 3D printed cast for 13% of the cost.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the use of multiple coding languages, Java, C++, html5, CSS, and Arduino we built a website from scratch and coded the hardware using Arduino to perform multiple functions simultaneously. Self-learning was essential for this project. Clay was used with the sole purpose to model the cast lining because the team did not have access to 3D printing.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Fried multiple wires, breadboard stopped working, fried a few sensors, and code got deleted at one point. The most difficult challenge was having our pressure sensor fry right before our final trial. It was caused by a faulty resistor. We were also missing a Bluetooth module which meant we couldn't send over data to our website. That was a big part of the project we hoped we would get to. Good news is that we have identified the future part we would need to purchase and have learned the code for it, even creating a sample code. Due to certain parts of the breadboard not working,

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding everything from basic coding to data transfer of coding. Getting three sensors to work at the same time through extensive research alongside trial and error.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience in web development and had to spend hours learning how all those languages work. We also were able to improve our hardware design to make it as compact as possible. We learned how multiple types of modules work and were able to make them measure realistic amounts.
