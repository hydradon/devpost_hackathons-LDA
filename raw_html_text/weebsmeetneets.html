According Urban dictionary:

                <p>
                    "Weeb is the lesser version of a weeaboo. Watches CGDCT anime, may or may not have a body pillow/waifu, usually browses r/animemes. Whatever you do, don't call them a weeb; it only makes them more powerful."

                <p>
                    "NEET stands for 'Not in Education, Employment or Training', a term used in Japan for shut-ins who watch anime." They are a group of people that needs love and attention.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help Naruto to find his Sasuke, Goku to find his Dragon Balls, and Luffy to find his pirate ship. Anime fans deserve love, anime fans deserve friendship! The goal of our app is to help build a world where no anime fan will be lonely ever again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects anime fans with anime fans. Users select people that they want to talk to based on their anime choice and waifu (favourite female anime character) or husbando (favourite male anime character).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can choose between the choice of waifu or laifu. If the user picks waifu, then the user approve the other anime fan base on their anime taste. If the user picks laifu, then user disproves of their anime taste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WARNING: at WeebsMeetNeets, we prohibit users from trash talking other people's waifus and husbandos! This is a serious matter, all users who violates this rule will be removed by the admin. Unless your husbando is Kirito from Sword Art Online, then you just suck.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with our passion for anime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And also a sprinkle of the following tools:
Django for backend, React for frontend, SQLite for database, and Kitsu-API for accessing anime-related data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had a huge fight deciding which anime character should we use for your login page.
