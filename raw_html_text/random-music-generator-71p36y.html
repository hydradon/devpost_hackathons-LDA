                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have musical backgrounds and wanted to make something fun with music and technology.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application takes some simple parameters and generates a MIDI file with some randomization.  This file is downloaded onto the user's phone and can be played back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio and Java can be annoying to work with, and documentation for many of the API's were either lackluster overall or just out of date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making a non-trivial Android application for the first time, meeting a deadline, and completing a hackathon project for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
