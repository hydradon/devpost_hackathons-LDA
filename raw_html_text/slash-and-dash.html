                    Want to find cheap flights to major cities?

                    This webapp will list the top five cities in terms of cheapest options from your departure location

                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, Node.js, React, Redux, Python, and an Amadeus API, we created a webpage that uses past airlines data to predict the future prices of the airlines to the destination cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When trying to use the python script to access data and pass along that data to the front, we ran into many errors and issues. It took 3 different mentors to help us out and finally after a couple hours, we finally figured out how to resolve the issue.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to combine our skills and make a product that almost worked exactly how we wanted it to. We are happy we got to learn so many new technologies and combine them all into a working product. Not only this, but acknowledging each other's strengths and weaknesses really helped us come together and work persistently as a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We didn't know much about the different javascript frameworks, but through persistence and trial-and-error we were able to figure out how they interacted and got most of the platform running from front-end to back-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will be looking to figure out prices for more than just a limited amount of cities, based upon a limited amount of inputs. We would love to expand the number of inputs to better suit the consumer's needs and be able to also predict where they would like to go next.
