                <p>
                    Our game is a PvP game where players move around and shoot projectiles at each other. You use arrow keys to move around and SPACE to shoot a projectile. The projectile launches in the direction that the player is facing. Each player has 3 health, and they are removed from the game when they run out of health.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with javascript and used Firebase database for the multiplayer.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of this project was syncing up the computers. We had never done anything multiplayer before, so it was extremely difficult. It took us a while to figure out how to send and receive data through the computers. We could only send simple data through Firebase so that the game wouldn't lag. We only sent x, y, dx, and dy through the server in order to tell the computer how the other player moved. We had to process the data on the client side to actually move the other player, and coding the processing part took up most of our time. After that, we coded the projectiles. For projectiles, we had to check for collisions with the players and the edge of the world.

                <p>
                    We got multiplayer to work through different computers.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Implementing multiplayer is way harder than it seems.
