                    In brief, the aim is to collect data from the car's CAN network and build a driver profile.
In order to achieve this we plan to simulate the CAN network via a CANoe Demo simulation.
The CAN simulation will update a log file while it is running. The log file will be linked via socket connection to a raspberry pi. The role of the raspberry pi is to parse the log file and interpret the messages within. The next step is to transfer the data via SPI to a second raspberry pi, which will act as a gateway.
Once the second raspberry pi has received the data, it will upload it to the cloud.
We will also aim to use the data from the cloud to build the user profile and provide data visualisation.
