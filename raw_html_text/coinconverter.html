                <p>
                    A special education teacher reached out to Julia because her students have difficulties with visualizing money and figuring out how to give change. We decided to create an application that would benefit those students, as well as younger children or anyone else who is a more visual learner.

                    This program to allow the user to input an amount, which will then be shown with the physical equivalence with the number of coins/bills alongside it. To assist with giving change, the user only has to input the starting cost and then click on the money that was given to them, and then the program will calculate the change and show which bills and coins to use (and how much of each). We also have a page that displays all of the graphics of the bills and coins, which the user can click. Upon clicking, the user will be directed to a page with the bill/coin rotating to reveal the front and backside, as well as fun facts and identifying features.

                <p>
                    For some reason, instead of saying 1 nickel is needed, the program sometimes says 5 pennies. This isn't
                    <em>
                        incorrect
                    </em>
                    , but it should be giving the user the most efficient route. We weren't able to solve this issue in the given time frame, but we will be working on it. Also, only having one person doing the art/graphics was a lot for one person to take on.

                    We are hoping to fix the small bugs and try to turn this into a real mobile application that can be used. We may even expand to try to get it to work with other currency and even work with cross-currency features.
