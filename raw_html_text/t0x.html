                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyEtherWallet, Shapeshift and Coinbase
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to manage ERC20 token on mobile and swap them using the decentralized exchange protocol 0x.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the 0x protocol for the backend swap and the Toshi platform to build a chatbot and manage funds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Toshi platform is very new and buggy. We were unable to access many of the Web3.js functions that are normally available on the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to allow users to manage and swap ERC20 tokens using a chatbot on mobile. Don't think thats been done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How big the possibilities are in this space and how powerful everything can be when various existing ecosystems and infrastructure components are combined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for t0x
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the UI and add new supported tokens. Furthermore, improving the backend swap mechanism.
