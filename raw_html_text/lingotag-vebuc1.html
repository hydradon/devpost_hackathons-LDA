                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LingoTag lets the user take a picture, analyzes it using the Clarifai API, and displays the top attributes in two languages, one in English and the other in a language that the user chooses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native, which is built on JavaScript, and the Ignite CLI as a boilerplate generator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing JavaScript and React-Native, and tackling unfamiliar run-time errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was one of the teammates' first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, we learned a new language, React Native. 
We also learned how to incorporate a physical camera in an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LingoTag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for LingoTag is to improve on the part where it displays contents of the image in two languages. As of now, it only supports English. Also, we want to allow the user to choose a photo from his/her photo album. Finally, we want to incorporate the logo that we designed.
