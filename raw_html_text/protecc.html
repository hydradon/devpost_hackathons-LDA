                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. Ann Cavoukian inspired us to find solution which advances a certain field without sacrificing privacy which is the usual cost to innovation nowadays, also known as the zero sum game. We also drew inspiration from Halle Berry's "The Caller", as it was the fact that the caller could not communicate through speech without giving her hiding location away to the intruder that led to her death.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a positive sum solution which strengthens security and privacy simultaneously. Our app offers an innovative way to request emergency services without having to speak on the phone which is a serious security risk at times. Users can now have emergency services dispatched to their location within 5 seconds through a few clicks on their phone, with the same simplicity as ordering a pizza. The app is able to compile and send information from users to dispatchers such as emergency type, services needed, location, and additional information required by dispatchers. Finally, the app offers a feature for direct chat or call if necessary with dispatchers.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Swift in Xcode and integrated Blockstack for strengthening of user privacy.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right name, design flow and Blockstack integration have been quite the challenge. However, we are proud to be able to present this app and look forward to what can come of it.
