                    Now, all the restaurants today throw away all this excess food, but we have a better solution. And this solution is Weave. Weave makes it easy for restaurant managements to donate their food to a local shelter or charity. It&rsquo;s simple: Charities sign into our app, find a location near them, input a value for the amount of food, and give a time for when they can come pick it up. When we walked in here, we came with no preparation. We didn&rsquo;t know what was expected of us, and we just hoped to make something basic. Little did we know that we would come here learn to code in Xcode, and create an app like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think that is is quite an accomplishment  that a group of three - 8th graders, first time hackers, with no experience whatsoever, came to this hackathon with the intent to learn, and learned how to program on Xcode, creating this amazing app. Now to emphasize the value of this,  40% of all food never gets eaten by humans, this means that event the food is there, but it doesn&rsquo;t get eaten. This means that this food can go to people who need it the most. &ldquo;Reducing food waste is the third most effective solution to fighting climate change, and a refrigerant  management and onshore wind turbines.&rdquo; Says a 2018 feedback report.  Before I open this up to Q and A, I would like to end with this: Weave can help our community, our state, our nation, and it is even a big step towards ending World Hunger.
