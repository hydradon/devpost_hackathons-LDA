                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs are playing an increasingly instrumental role in the realm of software development.  They bolster efficiency and the richness of an app.  We also have an interest in the development of AI, and we thought we would make a project utilizing IBM Watson's Visual Recognition API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a visual recognition web app where the user inputs the URL of a photo, and the web app returns information about the photo using the IBM Watson Visual Recognition tool. The user can then compare the information that the web app generates with the originally inputted photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the IBM Watson Visual Recognition API into Python code, and we turned this Python code into a Flask app with a basic front-end design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble with displaying the inputted image and information provided by the API on to the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time utilizing a third-party API and implementing into Python code.  We also dealt with the Flask web framework and we utilized server-side programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained extra insight into the manipulation of AI as well as the implementation of APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Experima
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create our own custom classification system for images, which trains the AI to produce increasingly accurate results and analyses of images, and in the future, videos.
