                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is for everyone from differently-abled people to amateurs to business leaders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea to give everyone an opportunity to dive into the programming field. Presenting ease for differently abled people to code by speaking through a microphone, it also adds the fun element to coding by enabling even amateurs to interact with the computer in a less daunting manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged existing emerging Google Cloud API to convert speech to text and built the Java program. We further extended the scope of the application by applying syntax and semantic analysis using Stanford CoreNLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the API and the CoreNLP framework into the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In spite of challenges with time constraints and integrating new technology, we pulled through to deliver on our ideas and principle that EVERYONE :-) can code.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team Work, Women empowerment and different technology stack.

                    What's next for Speak Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating NLP on a deeper level by developing gazetteers to train the application in a better way. We plan to explore other platforms similar to Dialog Flow.
