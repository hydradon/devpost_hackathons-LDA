                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the official death of the Mars rover Opportunity a few weeks ago, we choose to base our game off of space to remind us that there is more to the universe than us and our
                    <em>
                        choices
                    </em>
                    define our future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you play this game you get text showing what is happening, and then you get to choose between several different choices of what you can do next. As you play through the game, you move down your choices to lead to one of five possible endings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is based on a tree structure storing a series of nodes containing the data for each choice where the parent is what happened before and each child is a choice that could be made. 
The GUI is based on JavaFX using panes, text boxes, and buttons to organize the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to find a format where we can upload the data in a manageable way was very difficult. At first our plot had many more nodes and choices than we could possibly code, but after working out how to upload the data to our program using a series of text files and parsing them with key words it became a project that we could make work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The animation at the beginning added a lot of pizzaz to our text game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this program, we learned how to use a tree data structure and how to implement a GUI in JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Loss of Opportunity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this weekend, we've decided to continue to expand this game to include more chapters, more choices and better graphics.
