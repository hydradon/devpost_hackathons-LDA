                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we are not the best at making small talk. We wanted to create an app to help us and others practice conversations.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple mobile friendly browser game that has linear gameplay and two sprites.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used create-react-app for our base web app and are hosting it with firebase. We started by discussing structure of our web app, and splitting into teams, where some focusing on the front-end, and some on the backend. We had an experience leader that led the team, setting tasks and troubleshooting bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first idea was to record audio and interface with an API to tell the user's emotions. Unfortunately, we could not find a suitable api that worked well with React. So instead we wanted to focus on the content shown in the web app, but still trying to see throughout how we can implement our original idea.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website it clean looking and complete. The core functionality of the web app had finished, giving us extra time to work on making it look right. Our CSS Lead made the website beautiful while not over complex, and providing our icons and drawings here. We were very proud of making of the app multi-platform.
