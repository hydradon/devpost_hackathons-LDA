                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The members of the team are all passionate about video games and were interested in expanding our horizons with the latest advancements in technology. We wanted to leave a footprint in the rapidly-growing industry of Virtual Reality. We set a goal to incorporate a fun gaming environment using the latest VR technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows the player to fly around space on a unicorn and dodge asteroids. You can pick up different power-ups to further advance in the game and beat the high score. The unicorn is controlled by which direction the player is facing and can be changed by tilting your head towards a different direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as the primary game engine, with coding being done in C SHARP. We installed the oculus virtual reality development kit and the android software development kit and integrated those with Unity to build our game. We created various 3D models and textures using free softwares and also gathered royalty-free resources from the web. Our team split the work into two categories, design/layout and back-end programming. We filled in for each other when needed, allowing us to work more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many hardware limitations were encountered, prohibiting us from using the full capabilities of Virtual Reality technology. Platforms like the Oculus Rift required high graphics processing power and since our team did not have high enough specifications to meet the requirements, we unfortunately were not able to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our communication and teamwork allowed us to work very efficiently and we were able to make up for the time we spent trying to get the Oculus Rift to work. We were able to get lots of work done quickly and effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned that teamwork is key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Unicorn Arcade Blaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many more features we would like to add to Space Unicorn Arcade Blaster. One of the biggest innovations we would like to add is integrated enemy AI, allowing the player to face more difficult challenges. Another feature that we would like to incorporate is a multiplayer feature, allowing multiple players to play together simultaneously.
