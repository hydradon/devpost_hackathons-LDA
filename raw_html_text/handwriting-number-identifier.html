                <p>
                    We sincerely think Frank Ferrie is a great professor, and we want to help him grade assignments. Therefore, we made this application.

                    Recognize hand-writing number patterns
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, we got a lot of challenges. For example, we really had a tough time figuring out a good algorithm, adding to the fact that this is our first time studying AI.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic AI structure, at least how to use tensorflow at a beginner level
