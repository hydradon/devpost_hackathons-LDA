                    The Problem Chingu is Tackling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Companies need people with technical skills and experience, yet learners are increasingly stuck in what has been termed &ldquo;tutorial purgatory&rdquo; and lack accessible opportunities to gain experience building projects in teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tutorial purgatory is when a learner gets stuck in a cycle of watching/reading tutorial videos without building actual projects, ultimately feeling overwhelmed and not gaining the skills they need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An article published this summer titled "How to escape tutorial purgatory as a new developer" struck a chord in the developer community and is currently one of the top articles on Medium this year with 35k claps and over 100 comments, with most essentially saying "THIS IS ME!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chingu is building a global collaboration platform and coding-cohort generator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Chingu-cohort is a build-to-learn community, where motivated developers from around the world, are organized into teams to build a project in 8 weeks. We call these cohorts, Voyages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chingu so far though has been a collaboration platform without an actual &ldquo;platform&rdquo;. For each of the 50+ cohorts we&rsquo;ve ran - which includes people from 135 different countries - we&rsquo;ve managed to stay afloat using several unconnected tools such as forms, spreadsheets, slack, github repos, and trellos. With this many people, things tend to get a little messy and chaotic -- for all of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project for this competition aims to fix this and to allow our thriving underground community to emerge.

                <p>
                    The main challenge we've faced is in fine-tuning the team formation algorithm (aka choosing questions to ask on the application) and adding the correct weights to each criteria. When we assemble teams we consider everything from timezone, current skill level, learning goals, preferred tech-stack, time commitment per week, among others.
