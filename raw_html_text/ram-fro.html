                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really like rouge like games in general, was inspired to try my hand at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game where you need to survive as long as possible against increasingly difficult odds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++ in a team of two using SDL and glew as the most noteworthy libraries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an engine from scratch in C++ is hard, took us both 8 hours to just get the engine to a point where we could draw things to the screen, plus 24 hours with no sleep is no easy task!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it is surprising hard to balance a game (even one as small as this one) to be both fun and challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did it, got a working prototype in 24 hours that ticks most of our initial goals we set when we first started working!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making it through the night was a big achievement, sleep will be welcome tonight for sure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is key when handling projects like these, especially when working in a team.
Tools wise, we both learnt how to use git, a new experience for us both.
                </p>
