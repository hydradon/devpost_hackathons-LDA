                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used the MEAN stack

                    We were able to make a bot interact with our application through the MEAN stack
                </p>

                    What's next for Imitationga.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, there will be leaderboards where people can compare their scores with each other. We are also hoping that we can implement a way for players to submit their own bots.
