                    Problem we want to solve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main problems we aim to tackle with the carbon Co2sequences Carbon Calculator:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The lack of granularity in carbon footprint calculation
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The lack of general neutral reference open source tool for business to assess their products (usually business use their own marketing branding, or seal of quality etc.)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Carbon footprint calculators do exist but we felt they were not granular enough. Overall with what's available, you just input amounts of a given currency that you spend on a given good or service, such as travel, pharmaceuticals or food, and the estimate is done.
We want to get more granular and provide the most precise carbon footprint estimation at item level, both for customers and business that produce goods and services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What do we provide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An API access for business and a series of certification for businesses.

                    Our solution is targeting two segments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For users to take informed decisions about what they are buying, and see more clearly the daily impact that purchases can make.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For businesses, get a reference index for the products they are selling, use it as a marketing tool and/or benchmark tool for measuring the impact of their activities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
