                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's no quick way to make a diet based upon different caloric needs for different personal lifestyles. We want to find a way to make a personalized diet planner for Brandeis students to be more aware of their diet.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retrieve updated and quality menu information from Sodexo. Based on various health factors, we suggest a caloric consumption and suggest food options for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to retrieve the daily menu and nutrition facts from Sodexo. We also used Java to build a graphical UI so that the user can input their personal information. The app will display various food options and the user will choose out of the options, and then calculate the nutritional value of the chosen option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python Web scraping- fix nested textual issues. 
Java- Hard to cross out allergen-containing food options.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put together the pipeline of retrieving and analyzing data, which would then be displayed to the end-user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot of new technical skills, which include Python, web scraping, HTML, XML, Java.
We have also learned teamwork and perseverance.
                </p>

                    What's next for Brandeis Diet Planner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision that this project could give more personalized suggestions on how to balance diet, and make the graphical UI more appealing and simple. We also plan to integrate the python and java codes together.
