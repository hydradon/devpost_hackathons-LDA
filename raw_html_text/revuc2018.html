Code Name: Show Me Your Tunes

                <p>
                    The goal was to create a twitter bot that could be tweeted at and return a Spotify playlist. In order to build this we used several APIs to get information between the two. The APIs were for Spotify, Twitter, and we used IBM's Watson to pull keywords from the person who tweeted at the bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition we have also set up a website to loosely track our progress towards our goal.
