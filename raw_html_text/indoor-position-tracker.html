                    the recent disaster in Nepal showed me that the importance of safety cannot be understated. This app is a prototype that tracks your position indoors with hopes of expanding to a bigger and more advanced

                <p>
                    Indoor navigation system that guides users to the nearest and safest exit available. 
It works on the principle of wifi finger printing and takes multiple readings to track your position indoors based on WiFi signal strength

                    optimizing the application to work!

                    that we are able to finally get the app to work!

                    we learnt about the challenges of working in a hackathon environment, from the ease of being distracted, giving up when things aren't going well but still persevering through all of that to have something to show for at the end of it

                <h2>
                    What's next for indoor position tracker: we want to expand the app to our final target which is a fully working indoor navigation system that works with a bunch of sensors such as smoke alarms and thermal detectors, and refine the app we have built to make it the perfect disaster recovery management system during a building fire or earthquake
