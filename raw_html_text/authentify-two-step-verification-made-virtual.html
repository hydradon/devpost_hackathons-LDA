                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a friend's account getting
                    <strong>
                        hacked
                    </strong>
                    , and still not using Two Step Verification due to the hassles involved. Another common complaint from the users is that it is time consuming and slow.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Whenever the user tries to login (to say Email), the android app activates the microphone of the smartphone. The mic of the PC also gets activated. Both mics acquire ambient audio and stream it to
                    <strong>
                        Microsoft Azure's Blob Storage
                    </strong>
                    . These audio streams are compared by utilizing audio signal processing algorithms. And if they have a high similarity score, then the user is authorized to login.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here are the exact steps we followed:
1) A simple android app was made which acquired audio when triggered
2) The acquired audio is stored to Azure Blob Storage.
3) A local python program acquired this audio from the cloud to the local PC
4) The audio from the cloud gets compared to the locally acquired audio
5) If similarity score is high then the user is authorized

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We couldn't find a way to stream the audio to azure for real time processing, so it had to be transmitted in Blobs.
2) Integration to any site can be made possible by the site owner only

                <p>
                    1) Using Azure for the first time to develop an end to end app
2) Working with intricate audio signal processing algorithms

2) How complex it is to process real time data without the usage of cloud services like Azure

                <p>
                    Currently, the app is not integrated into any website. In a few days, we are going to approach a few big websites to get them to add our application, which will make two step verification simpler.
