                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use as may sensors as possible for this project, and this type of game succeeds with that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LCD screen tells the player to do a certain command within a time limit, and if the time expires, you lose! If you complete the command, you advance to a new command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked out the logic and used c# to build the structure of the program. I used the Grove Starter Kit for the sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the sensors didn't work at first, so finding out that it was the sensors and not the code took a while.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made my first Arduino program and utilized as many sensors as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduinos can be used for a wide variety of projects, and I've just scratched the surface with this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wildhacks-Bop-It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be making an app with Ionic to tweak settings and add a more visual interface instead of just the LCD screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I haven't taken any programming classes yet at UW. The only computer class I have taken is ECE 252. Before this workshop, I haven't used Arduinos or heard of IoT. I learned some C# for this project, which is a language I haven't used before. The hardest thing I've learned is having the Arduino communicate over the internet. I had some trouble with this, so I decided not to pursue this. If I had full sets of kits to use, I would expand the use of this game and use Arduinos for more than just games. I would use Spark Cores and Azure to make scalable applications.
