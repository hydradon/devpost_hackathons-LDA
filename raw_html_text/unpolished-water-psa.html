                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a stupid but fun game that does apply to real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game raises awareness about the need to conserve water because there are people who need it in both developed and developing countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the project using Unity and Monodevelop. The map and images were created using an Adobe Photoshop look-a-like, FireAlpaca.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know how to code games at all, and we had trouble with our initial idea/plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functional basis of a game, including movement and a goal/end destination!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of great alternatives to Photoshop, the Internet provides more resources than anyone could think there would be imaginable. We also learned that Unity has many free made objects with fields of their own and those objects could be applied using physics to control in-game movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for (unpolished) water psa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve the graphics and perhaps add a title screen and/or additional levels with new obstacles, like terrain that controls character speed.
