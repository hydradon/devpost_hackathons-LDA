                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to show children how important it is to avoid pathogens, and teach them how they can gain protection against them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game in which the kid need to collect the fruits, vaccines and antibiotics while avoiding bacteria and viruses with increasing difficulties level-by-level.
