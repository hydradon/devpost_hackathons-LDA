                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music needs a visual representation. We wanted to solve that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Vibe-rater uses a microphone to listen to any song playing and then creates a real-time display of the music's waveform with a display of LEDs. It projects this display over an elegant design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The music response system was built using arduino, an LED strip, and a microphone. The display tower was created with acrylic plexiglass that was sanded to a frosty appearance, connected with steel rods and mounted on a wooden foundation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The microphone had very poor input quality and sometimes the data it supplied was inadequate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finalizing the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use music and sound with arduino and measure their characteristics. Taking this data and using it to then display different LED results.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Vibe-rater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more display modes and options.
