                    An app that helps you choose a meal based on available ingredients
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that makes it easier to create or cook meals with the convenience of few clicks. We built it it with React-Native and originally planned with AWS but we ran into some difficulties and switched to Firebase. This was our first time using React-Native and we learned a lot, especially how to integrate each processes with each other and fetching the API.
