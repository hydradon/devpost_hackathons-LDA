                    1.) We use Genomelinks Authentication API to get authenticated Users Genetic Data by using
                    <b>
                        Genomelinks Nodejs Sample Project API
                    </b>
                    which we hosted on
                    <b>
                        Glitch.com
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    2.) We then Forward the retrived content to another site
                    <b>
                        Ogachijo.com
                    </b>
                    so that we can save the Users Genetic Data to our
database runing PHP and Mysql.

                    Genomelinks requires entering the
                    <b>
                        "Client Id's, Secrets and Callback URL"
                    </b>
                    in a terminal or Command prompt. This will 
become a problem when launching the application online because nodejs will go off once you close the termial. To mitigate 
this issue, I have to create an external environment variables files
                    <b>
                        .env
                    </b>
                    and then teweak Genomelink API Nodejs code to integrate the enviroment
 variables thus making it as part of the Genomelinks API.
                    <b>
                        No more entering of Client Id's, Secrets and Callback URL"

prompt, Terminals or Command Prompt.....

                <p>
                    1.)Login using Genomelink.
                    <br>
                    2.)Create a Temporal Geno Account(Just Username) and then login using temporal username. This used because the Genomelink API does not provide
us a way of gettin authenticated users
                    <b>
                        username
                    </b>
