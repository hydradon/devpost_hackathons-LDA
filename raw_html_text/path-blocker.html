                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mind... Also the fact that I love mazes but it's usually always the same thing in games- that you need to lead someone through the maze. I thought about what if the maze was designed to stop something from leaving?

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Path blocker is a simple, minimalistic, and unique game in which the player holds the power to stop monsters from leaving a maze by tapping on maze walls to move and switch them before time is up.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used XCode and Swift to built the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran to a lot of challenges with making a proper randomly generated maze each time the game is launched. It was also difficult for me to properly place maze wall sprites in the proper location since I needed to convert from location point to the grid cell coordinates. I also had trouble with making the maze walls clickable and putting restrictions on that.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the whole app, honestly it was a lot of work! I'm most proud of the maze walls being able to move.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learnt how to apply the basic coding skills to making a larger project and applying my basic skills to more complicated topics of coding.

                    What's next for Path-Blocker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to do a lot with Path Blocker, firstly adding a more interactive tutorial, then making harder and better modes that have faster monsters, a bigger maze, power ups for the player to use, and a villager that the user needs to save. With a simple, yet fun game like this, the possibilities are endless.
