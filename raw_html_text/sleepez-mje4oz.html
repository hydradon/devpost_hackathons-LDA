                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students are exhausted and sometimes forget to turn off the lights before knocking out and going to bed. This causes them to not only have a worse night's sleep because of the lack of darkness, but also causes energy waste. We wanted to do something to help the student and the world.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack turns off a light when a person goes to sleep, which is sensed by a Fitbit that the person is wearing. Therefore, when the person is asleep, so are their lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our hack using the Fitbit API. Their API allowed for us to monitor the heart rate of the user, and respond according to specific changes in heart rate. We wrote the algorithm for detecting when the user is asleep, and had the Fitbit respond by sending out a signal to the Dragonboard. Fitbit's developer studio allowed us to run a simulation of a Fitbit Ionic that we could test our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A huge obstacle was definitely the poor Wifi connection, since we needed to download a multitude of large files. This wasted a lot of time that we could have spent hard coding or debugging. In addition, trying to link the Fitbit to the Dragonboard through WiFi was a huge task, since we had to not only send over the data from one device to another, but also allow the data to be read in a different format, since the code for the Fitbit was written in Javascript, while the code for the LED in the Dragonboard was written in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use SSH, code only within the Linux terminal, and the basics of the Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c device. Most of all, we were all newly exposed to hacking an IoT project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SleepEZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to be able to connect more appliances to SleepEZ to create a peace of mind for the user knowing that everything in their house will be taken care of properly whether they remember or not before they go to bed. An addition that we were thinking of were connecting to a smart door that would lock their doors. In addition, we could also program the Fitbit to recognize when the user wakes up based on the change in heart rate and begin making a coffee for the user.
