                    Phobia, a type of anxiety disorder, is defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear. The affected person goes to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. 
Facing fears in a gradual and consistent manner is the most effective way to overcome fears and phobias and is called &ldquo;exposure&rdquo;. So we created a virtual method of solving this problem. We used Virtual Reality to provide a platform where the person will face their respective fears at several levels with increasing difficulty. A watch will sense the changes and send the data, pulse rate, on the mobile app. This could help store previous records as well.
