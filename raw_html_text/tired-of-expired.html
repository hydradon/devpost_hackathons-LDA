                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own tendencies of forgetting about leftovers and food and trying to minimize our own food waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website keeps track of food items in your fridge and when they will expire. It notifies you when something is expiring soon so you can plan your meals accordingly to minimize your food waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the learning curve of learning a new language, since none of us have created a website before or coded in Javascript/HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make a website that is able to properly store user input, alert the user about the food's expiration, and display a list of foods in the fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development and how frustrating it can be, but how amazing it felt when we reloaded the page and our HTML code was working properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tired of Expired
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, we have reserved the domain tiredofexpired.org for this website. In the future, we want to be able to categorize the food items by category, such as food group, by expiration date, by date the food was added, and any customizable tags that the user wants to create for themselves (such as meal, etc.). We also want to add a feature that suggests foods you can make with the food items you have logged in your fridge.
