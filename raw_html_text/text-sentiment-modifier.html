                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by Google&rsquo;s Natural Language API, particularly its sentimental analysis. Sentimental analysis allows a software to tell how positive or negative a string of text is. We wanted to see if we could write software to work in the opposite direction. Could we provide some text and get the computer to output a modified version that sounded happier? We accomplished this by searching through a list of synonyms for random words and choosing a replacement that matched the desired sentiment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program takes a string of text and modifies words in it to make the sentiment of the text more positive or negative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project in Python, using PyDictionary and Google's Natural Language API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we were unable to change the sentiment of the text, while keeping the meaning the same.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making it work in the desired way, because, for a long time, the text sounded like gibberish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is hard to get a software to understand the context of a word. We learned to work in a team and how to use the Google API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text Sentiment Modifier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, we have a restricted set of words that we can actually modify the sentiment of. We could expand this set of words in the future.
