                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students with many small daily transactions, we found it difficult to manage our finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app prompts the user for any financial question and provides financial history for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialogflow for the integration of voice, then used Android Studio to develop the app. We then used Firebase within Android Studio to integrate Dialogflow into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Integrating Dialogflow into our app was very challenging because of the intricacies involved in the process.
