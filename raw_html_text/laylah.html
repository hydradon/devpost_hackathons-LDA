                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like video games and we wanted to try making one from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very simple game and is more a proof of concept. Running around and jumping are laid out, and some art assets are used to give the game more life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a lightweight language called lua and a framework called L&Ouml;VE2D which are both good for making simple 2D games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of time was spent on the art assets and multiple collision and physics bugs were encountered. Making a video game from scratch, even a simple one, proved harder than we first believed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a game that runs and a menu screen that has functionality. We animated the sprites with surprising detail and even managed to get some physics to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video game programming is hard and time constraints mean that a lot needs to be cut.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Laylah
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue this game in a better engine, like Unity. Our next big milestone would be implementing puzzle rooms as well as an opening story cutscene.
