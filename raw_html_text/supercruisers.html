                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently my local grocer Frank showed me a photo of what his grocery store was like 20 years ago. Large, well kept, and able to employ his family &amp; neighbourhood students he was one of many local stores in the Danforth area. But 10 years ago Metro opened, he&rsquo;s had to downsize it&rsquo;s hard to compete with the easy and predictable experience that Metro has to offer. Frank wants to invest in their stores to give their customers the highest level of service, but when every dollar means so much and time is limited - where and how can he spend it well?

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An end-to-end product offering begins with installation of a suite of IoT sensors that collect data and are sent to the cloud. IoT sensors quantify the different aspects of the atmosphere that contribute to the customer experience, giving the store owners business insights they would not have otherwise. Our analytics then provide a view of consumer behaviour and impactful ways to drive a better experience for your customers. This information is packaged in an easily digestible dashboard/user interface.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting early adopters to buy into this technology could be a challenge. However, utilizing Rogers' existing costumer base we can incentivize clients to test and validate this technology.
