                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For vegans it is often hard to find the desired info because they often get bombarded with calls to buy something non-vegan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps feeling good by providing the nearest all-vegan places to eat and to select vegan food that has all the necessary nutrients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server interfaces to databases like foursquare and USDA food composition databases. The skill interfaces to the the server to query for that information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Information as it is on screen browsers is generally to complex to present by voice. The challenge was to reduce and extract info on foods that contain a nutrient asked for, to be comprehensive and at the same time concise enough to be understandable by voice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's great to see the skill telling what foods contain most vitamin C, or any other requested nutrient, without having to debate and dive into books any more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to update an existing skill, bringing the code to the same level that I am now developing as. This has been my first Alexa skill and therefore was coded on a beginner level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for vegi.style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    vegi.style should remember what people have asked for in the past, and in that context tell new things going further into detail than on previous answers.
