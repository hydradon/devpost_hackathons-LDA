                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for the project was to make the experience of going to the retail store enjoyable and more engaging to the customer and at the same time make it more informative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user won't have to rely on the helping staff to go around to know about a product or its features. The user would just walk into the store with his/her device and would be able to get the information augmented on their device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brain-stormed it to be a augmented reality application using Unity and AR/VR Vuforia SDK to enable our idea. On top of that, it would use machine learning algorithms to identify between the various models and pull specific information from the internet for that predicted model. To cherry it on the top, we decided to add a random imaginary object a user would need to find when he/she enters the store, and would be rewarded with some offers/discounts on finding that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of finding a specific model ran into problems since almost all devices had the same shape, and the only way to identify the model would be a price tag, or the name written alongside the device, but identifying that in itself is a beast. Also integrating machine learning models with unity using the ml-agents, in beta version, is not easy as their are less tutorial to explain how stuff actually functions and they are mostly built for games only. The challenge was then to identify a workaround to get the predicted shape on the screen.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried a lot of stuff with Unity, Vuforia, and tensorflow that would'nt be done in a day, if it was'nt a hackathon. We were able to pull object tracking in android studio and seperately built a AR app using unity and Vuforia engine in the time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the integration of the project is an important task which should not be left for the end, and the importance of having atleast one member experienced in some field gives a upper hand.
                </p>

                    What's next for Aug-Gami-fication Reality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate our object tracking model with the AR application and add a gamification object to the project to make it more fun!
