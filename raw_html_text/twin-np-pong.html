                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PS Vita could have been one of the greatest handheld consoles ever. Despite the fact that it never sold quite well and had a hardcore niche, Sony made few efforts to manage this situation, and with the success of PS4, left the console in oblivion.

                <p>
                    However, half a year ago some people managed to find a way to load homebrew onto the system, and the console gained a second life (Vita, in fact, means life in italian). Considering development was made using C/C++ (which I already know thanks to college), and the many capabilities of the console, developing some stuff for it was a no-brainer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply plays a game of Pong. You control both players using the left and right stick.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C, SDL, Sublime Text, my own PS Vita, pain and lots of time wasted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Damn SDL. At first I could draw a rectangle, only to realize it wasn't erasing them everytime I moved it. Fixed it, screen gives you epilepsy attacks. Fixed that, can't draw multiple rectangles at the same time. Couldn't load BMP files using both abs. and rel. paths. Lack of sleep and constant lethargy. And yet, I found somewhere how to draw 2+ rects, and started doing a pong to have something done. Made it harder than usual. Then I went to sleep.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that it simply works and that the main logic was made in just an hour. However, I started with few hours left until deadline, so I didn't have much to do... But I finished, so I'm proud of finishing on all 3 HackUPCs!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That while Vita development is relatively easy (thanks to a community that actually cares about the console), SDL isn't as easy as I thought. And that maybe I could foresee what I'll have to do in following hackathons!

                    What's next for Twin NP Pong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe fixing some bugs, polishing difficulty and adding some nice extra aesthetics. Also, doing some slick menus and implementing some kind of restart/pause button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And maybe exploring more stuff for the PS Vita and doing cooler hacks in the future!
