                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the mobile app "Rockbot" which allows users to vote on songs that play in public areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a Discord bot that allows users to play YouTube videos over voice channels and gives them the ability to vote on which song to play next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the discord.py library and YouTube-dl library. The project is coded in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple issues with the discord.py library since it had gone through large update relatively recently that made many past code examples not functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program plays music through Discord voice channels and users can vote on songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our skills with Python and became familiar with the discord.py library.
                </p>
