                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student residing in the Baltimore Area, I think two of the largest issues are violent crime and poverty. Furthermore, organizations are frequently seeking helping hands to volunteer for their events. These issues inspired us to build this app which attempts to help connect the gap between those in poverty, charitible organizations, and potential volunteers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows charities to post information about when and where they are going to be holding their events. For example, a soup kitchen could make an &ldquo;event&rdquo; with a certain address, date, and description. Then people in need of food, now aware of the &ldquo;event,&rdquo; are then able to go to the location and make use of much needed resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, under the &ldquo;details&rdquo; of this event, people in a position to donate resources can do so. They can specify an item description as well as quantity, giving the charitable organization a good idea of how many extra resources may be available. Furthermore, people can sign up as volunteers allowing organizations to preview how many helping hands they may receive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core functionality of this app is built with JavaScipt and Firestore&rsquo;s NoSQL database, and the UI is built with HTML/CSS and some aid from the bootstrap framework. Our database structure is composed of a &ldquo;event-list&rdquo; collection. The event collection has documents which represents the events, and each of these documents&rsquo; fields holds relevant information: address, date, description, volunteers, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also attempted to use the google maps API to plot event address, but we were not able to implement this successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into quite a few challenges. Most of these revolved around the way Firebase requires developers to interact with it. For example, for me to sync the adding and deleting of events in real time, I had to follow the specific mechanism that Firebase uses (Snapshots, Changes, Event Listeners, etc.). However, after carefully reading documentation, some patience, and plenty of trial and error, I was able to solve all these issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was interacting with the google maps API. We attempted to integrate the plotting of addresses to a map, but this caused many issues. For example, we had to use a different mapquest api to convert street addresses to the latitudes and longitudes google maps requires in order to plot points. This is remained unresolved and would be the first thing we would tackle if we had more time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am most proud of how I was able to integrate an end to end web app with a simple, but functional design. Users have access to useful information that is concisely displayed. I think that anyone who looked at this app would be able to navigate and use it. I am also proud of how I was able to problem solve the vast amount of issues that occurred when I was building this app.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest thing I learned was interacting was Firebase. I had done a mini project with it before allowing me to quickly set up and connect to Firestore; however, I had never made as extensive use of the functionality as I did in this project. I had a great time learning about the collection-document structure of FireStore, and I think this would be a great springboard for me to learn about more feature rich but less friendly NoSQL databases like Mongo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned how to manipulate DOM elements with Javascript. In previous web apps I would hardcode a significant amount of the webpage content in HTML. This time I challenged myself to use JavaScript wherever possible to manipulate components on the webpage. I learned that this is a far more scalable technique, and something I should definitely explore more perhaps with a JavaScript library like React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dibs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I see two clear next steps for Dibs. The first would be to finish the functionality of the Google Maps API. Although people could just plug the address into Google Maps themselves, I think it follows the theme of our user interface that all the information is readily available on the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second would be the aggregation of more sources and displaying the data from those sources in a precise and concise manner. If I could scrape organizations pages for their events it would thereby automate the &ldquo;event creating&rdquo; process. This would mean more events would be available and those seeking these events would have a larger selection. However, this would mean we would have to organize how we displayed the events, so they aren&rsquo;t all jumbled on the main page. Perhaps creating a search or sorting functionality would be useful. For example, a user might want to look for events within a certain radius or their location, or at a specific time window, and in order to do this we would have to both be able to better collect and display the information.
