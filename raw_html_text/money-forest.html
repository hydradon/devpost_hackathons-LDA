                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by mobile AR experiences like Pokemon Go and Minecraft Earth, alongside zen garden apps to create an augmented reality garden that grows based on your financial health. Although apps currently exist from banks and other third parties to track and show you your finances, they don't do a very good job of making your financial health clear. We wanted to visualize this health with something that was both fun and relaxing, yet still remaining informative and useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money Forest makes use of the TD Da Vinci API to import your financial information into our Android app. From there, a Tree is generated for your account, and based on your recent transactions, the tree grows to illustrate the size of your savings. At times, a Big Yoshi appears and gives you financial advice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android's ARCore and Sceneform SDK, TD's Da Vinci API in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we had were in the testing phases, as Android Studio's emulator can be very slow and resource-intensive. ARCore was also new to us and making sure our assets appear in real life was challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having built an AR app that makes our data appear in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that developing for Android has a lot of overhead, which can make it difficult to start off, but it has a lot of powerful tools to create apps like Money Forest. Also, we learned that AR development is hard and confusing and sometimes everything is in the floor and sometimes it's in the ceiling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Forest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a more expansive forest that more acutely responds to the changes in a user's account that can help them be more aware of their spending habits and how to improve them.
