                        Introduction
                    </strong>
                    MHPlayer is a command line MP3 player that is agile to let your computer focus on more 
critical functions. The program accepts song file paths as arguments, plays each song 
in succession, and terminates upon completion.  With this C program, you can change 
your songs without leaving your coding space and can run the program in the background 
while you continue your work.

                        Motivation
                    </strong>
                    We chose to create this program to learn to manage other forms of output for the user. 
Music is an important part of many students' lives, and this project showed us many of 
the levels of complexity present in a media player, that are often taken for granted.
