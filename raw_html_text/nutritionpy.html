                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It captures the food image from the connected camera module in raspberry pi. It processes the image using Microsoft's Computer Vision API. Grabs the relevant food's tag and feeds that data in Nutritionix API to get the food's nutrition detail. It takes that nutrition detail and shows on the website.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into:
communication between two API.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon. Our program was able to identify the food with great accuracy and give its nutrition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use various different languages and how to integrate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NutritionPy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group member Paras was stuck in a long queue in a Golden Correl when he had an idea of self chut system for buffet restaurant. This is how we got our inspiration to build a computer application that identifies the food, displays its nutrition, measure its weight and use it to self checkout. Due to time constraints we werent able to finish the checkout process. This can be added further to make it a self checkout application in the future. 
This application can also be used to keep track of your daily intake of nutrition but just taking a picture. A daily database of your food can be stored this way.
