                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has your friend ever been at a restaurant at lunch on campus and you wanted something as well? Well obviously all you had to do is tell him to buy it for you as they're already there and they're going to be seeing you later anyways. This is the inspiration for Taskii.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taskii is an app that is designed to make the lives of students of Waterloo better by bringing students together to complete tasks and fill desires of fellow students. The idea is that if you want food at a certain place or need to get something from a store but the destination is too far and inconvenient, you open up the Taskii app and look on the map to see who is at the current location. The fellow Taskii user at that location can make the purchase for you and bring it back to you if they are on the way back home or live in the same residence for a small fee. This makes the app delivery fee cheaper, more convenient, and more environmentally friendly as someone does not have to go out of their way to make the delivery.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app interface and design outline is built on Figma. We are currently in the stages implementing the Google maps SDK on Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were mainly coming up with a feasible idea that would create a positive benefit in the world, one community at a time.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design outline and the landing page for the app.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use software such as Figma to create a design outline for the project to make it easier to code. We also learned to create a landing page in order to gauge interest for our project.
