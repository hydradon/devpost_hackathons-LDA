                    A lot of students need help with school for certain subject, but don't go for tutoring because of the lack of choices, the high prices, and many of them are not in their area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created an app which enables two parties (Tutors and Students) to get started.
The
                    <strong>
                        tutor
                    </strong>
                    creates a profile with their name, price per hour and Subjects they teach. 
The
                    <strong>
                        student
                    </strong>
                    simply searches all the tutor profiles which can be sorted in either by price or by subject being taught.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was built in Android Studio alongside Parse. First we used Android studio to design the interface (using XML) and then we programmed what each part of the interface did (using Java). After that we had to have a backend service, and since none of us are backend developers, we used Parse to host all of our files. For example when the tutor created their account, it would store all of their data into Parse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <strong>
                        biggest
                    </strong>
                    challenge we ran into is that we are all beginner programmers, and we had close to zero experience to programming in Android Studio and app development. With this being said, throughout our whole journey, in these 36 hours we had a lot of frustration and we ran into small problems consistently along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment that we are proud of is that none of us had any experience with this program, yet we were able to make a fully functional app that performs most of the tasks that we intended to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned was how Android Studio works. It has 2 different files, one for the layout, and one for the code to perform function from the layout. We were also able to understand how a backend system works, and how specifically how Parse works and its commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next steps for tuber is to create a rating system where after a student has had a tutoring session with the tutor, they can rate the tutor, from 1 to 5 stars.
