                    Oscar Shi came up with the initial idea to use integrated circuits to play games. Now, there are accelerometers and gyroscopes available at YHack, so we decided that it would be a good idea to create a simple motion sensor.

                    The code is converted into multiple floating-point values within the IC. These values are then sent into the computer through I2C, which is interpreted through C#'s SerialPort class. The SerialPort reads each reading as it comes and modifies the rotation of the arm. The arm can be used to pick up various things and throw them. Currently, it acts to move just the wrist, with a button on the keyboard used to do most tasks with grabbable objects.
