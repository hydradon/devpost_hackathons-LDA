                    &middot;        This is an android app designed as a system for the elderly (check) and their trusted friends or family (mate). It sends notifications to the elderly person asking them to check in (so the name check), and if they don&rsquo;t do it after a certain amount of time, it will send an email to everyone on their friends list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;        Go through the application
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;        If we had more time, we would send notifications to the mates when their check is not okay, instead of an email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &middot;        If we had more time, we might also make it possible for a user to be both a mate and a check so the elderly could be a mate for their elderly friends.
