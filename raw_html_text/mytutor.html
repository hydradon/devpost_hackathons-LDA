                        As college becomes more and more competitive, the rigor of coursework increases exponentially. In order to keep up with classes and to prepare for the intensive courseload expected of many students today, MyTutor was created. The goal of MyTutor is to streamline the process for students to find the resources available to them on campus at whatever college they may attend.

                    <li>
                        Our group first spent several hours learning the basics of HTML and Django as no one in the group had prior experience. In the following hours, a website was constructed to ask for user input such that a table could be made so that when a user searches for a class 'x' the relevant results could be outputted. To create the website, the initial HTML prototypes were imported into Django as templates and refined over the course of the night.

                    <li>
                        Figuring out the basics Django and HTML proved to be much, much more difficult than expected. There were few tutorials on Django explaining how to do what our group was hoping to accomplish and so a lot of time was wasted sifting through the documentation of Django and HTML to figure out what was crucial to completing our website. Learning how to create form templates and connecting HTML with databases proved to be the most difficult encounter out of the project.

                    <li>
                        To further refine MyTutor, a method must be developed to gather data on the resources available on campuses. In the future, there should also be cleaner UI and improved functionality so that online resources could be included as well. MyTutor should also include a 'favorite' system so that users may be notified of upcoming office hours they're interested in attending.
