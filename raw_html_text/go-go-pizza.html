                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to build Go-Go-Pizza when we saw that we could build an app that made pizza ordering fun and easy and for everyone to get what they like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to swipe right or left or up, to order your favorite toppings or pizza style to have the right pizza for everyone to enjoy. Right means that you like it, Left means that you don't like it, and Up means, you love it. Your friends can share their input to ensure you that you order the best pizza ever for everyone!
                </p>
