                </h2>
                <p>
                    Home Depot, one of the largest home improvement companies around, is making progressive changes in the way they run their business in an attempt to attract more customers. In recent years, Home Depot has been brainstorming ways to appeal more to millennials. In doing so, they are creating more online tutorials and how-to videos. We wanted to go one step further by introducing a DIY virtual assistant making it easier for customers to start a new project.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot communicates with users in order to develop a DIY project plan. Specifically focusing on what tools and materials the user will need.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a bot kit base and integrated it with facebook messenger web hooks. Then, we added a LUIS.ai middleware for NLP related tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: We were unable to deploy our bot in time. We tested and ran using localhost.
