                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the potential of the Google Home, and by struggling restaurants who are short staffed.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Home responds to a variety of demands (e.g. "I want an egg mcmuffin" to "what do you suggest?" The end goal was for these commands to transfer data to the website so that the employees can see what to prepare.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RapidOrder was made using Firebase and DialogFlow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DialogFlow is relatively new so it is not very well documented. Integrating DialogFlow and Firebase also proved to be an obscure topic. However, the main challenge of DialogFlow was the lack of necessary features, e.g. getting more than one value of the same category.

                    Google Home responds in a logical way!
