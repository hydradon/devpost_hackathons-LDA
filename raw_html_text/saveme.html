                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we saw the story of the killing of Hannah Graham, we thought of ways we could protect college students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App is a form with a location sensor. A student is to fill out a form when they leave or enter campus, and provide a general destination and return time. If a student goes out of campus at an odd hour, exits campus radius, or does not return near the expected return time, he/she will be notified through text and/or tracked through the app. Additionally, the app uses location data to determine whether the student is within school boundaries or not. If a student is in distress, they can contact their school campus, and location data will be given to the campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an app that tracks a start and endpoint of a student's journey, and were able to create a form where a student would enter their destination, return time, name and ID number. We were unable to connect these two together, but were able to send location data through our apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get quite a bit done. We are proud that we were able to create a platform that a student could use. Additionally, we were able to configure it such that once a student enters in their name and ID, that information would be retained to their phone. We were also happy that our app was able to track a students location and additionally pull up google maps through that same app with directions to a destination if or when the student needs it. We were also able to use JGrasp to create a radius and enter in data points to tell whether a student is inside the designated school zone or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio, but mainly used MIT App Inventor. For data storage, we used iFormBuilder, where we studied the API to create the user interface.  We were also surprised to learn how we could use JGrasp and Java to create a radius around the school and input data points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SaveMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to tie the two apps together to create a single app that would be able to open up, have a student input their data, and be able to track that student if need be.  We would like to code more of in into Android Studio, for more flexibility than drag and drop options.
