                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its always really difficult to find empty and quiet rooms around the campus, most of them are either really packed and or really noisy. So, whenever lecture rooms are not being used, why not use those rooms for yourself?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides real time updates, uses Location services to map the closest rooms to you. Maximizes UofC infrastructure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode, We got the data from PeopleSoft through dndn.ethv.net, they had done the hard work of scraping people soft, and we used that data for our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing XML was difficult, not all classes are in correct format, some rooms have weird names and so on...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An actual working app that we can show off! Also alot of students we have asked have given us very positive feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, code under stress, using XML and JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for checkR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing MapKit, make scrapping data more efficiently. The framework is in place, all it needs is data and it can update every semester.
