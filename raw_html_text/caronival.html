                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever found yourself in Durham for a day or Chapel Hill for a week? Your first thought, likely, is to use Yelp or TripAdvisor to find restaurants to eat at or landmarks to visit... But those apps are for tourists. Why not live like a local?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have integrated Algolia API's search functionality with Eventful API's event database, making you able to find local events, parties, and concerts happening around you or in any city in the US. If you choose an event from the search, we've got you covered with Here API's location services and routing functionality, sending coordinates to Google Maps API to show you where you'll be going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had used React before, but we knew it was the best thing to use for a web-based application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We (pretty much) learned React!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work together better. We were all trying to sort of do our own thing and hope it came together, but teamwork is what really got us going at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Caronival
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to integrate an API for finding flights, such as Priceline or Expedia, so users may book flights and add events to their schedule all in one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some day, we'd also like to develop this into a mobile app - likely using React Native. With a mobile app, we would have the ability to add ride services via Lyft and/or Uber which would go along with the use of Priceline or Expedia - users can book flights, plan their trip, and schedule/call for rides all through our app.
                </p>
