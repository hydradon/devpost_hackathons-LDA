                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the members of our team feel deeply about this issue of staying safe especially for individuals in vulnerable situations and have even personally felt unsafe at times. Despite living in an era of technology, we are also living in a time of mass crime rate as well as violence and wish to increase security by ensuring individuals have a form of communication even when they do not have a cell phone in hand.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LivSafe is a smart wearable that analyzes the voice of users using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to notify emergency contacts.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon, we aimed to build an MVP which could function by connecting a microphone to a DragonBoard&trade; 410c series microprocessor using speech recognition API to identify hot words and then performing IBM Watson&rsquo;s sentiment analysis API to detect and analyze the distress faced by the user. The decision made then triggers SparkPost&rsquo;s API to send text messages asking for help. Furthermore, we are putting together these features on a web application and hosting them on Microsoft Azure.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were being able to implement and combine the different API, however, we were eventually able to get through it with some assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of include putting our different aspects of code together, despite our distinct coding interests and being able to create a product that can be revolutionary in the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about teamwork and how to efficiently work on a project and achieve our similar goal. We believe this will help us prepare for our computer science skill-building and are looking forward to attending more hackathons to get used to working with different technologies and also as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LivSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LivSafe is not done with its final product as of yet in order to ensure top quality security once it is released to the public. We will develop even deeper sentimental analysis and will look for ways to increase speed in terms of sending SMS messages via web applications.
