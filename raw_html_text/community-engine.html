                    Many community members struggle to convey the impact of long term projects to their people. Statistics, words and even pictures are often insufficient to communicate the necessity of starting (or stopping) an investment. What&rsquo;s more, people often absorb this information in a vacuum, unaware of their larger community&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter.

                    Community Engine is a Collaborative XR (CEXR) app that gives any individual the ability to share their vison for infrastructure developments that impact their lives. It also lets them build a case for their idea by collecting feedback from the community based on both time and space.
