                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        At Space Nyx, we believed that every active android gamer deserved to experience space as a Space Destroyer!

                    <strong>
                        Space Nyx is a multiplayer Space Inspired app which allows 2 players to destroy asteroids as they fly through the galaxy trying to beat family and friend to be ultimately called "Destroyer of the Galaxy.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Space Nyx was built with the crucial use of Unity and the programming language C#.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <strong>
                        Getting the game to implement the Multiplayer function as well as creating the GUI was a great challenge for our group.
                    </strong>

                    <strong>
                        We believe that accomplishing the overall idea of our game and making it into reality was a great accomplishment.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We learned that coding is an extremely precise and important tool needed for the future of our world, as well as space of course.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        In the future, we would like to eventually include compatibility with Oculus and other VR headsets, not just Google Cardboard. Eventually, we also would like to implement a Bluetooth 4.0 functionality so that Space Destroyers can play the game offline as well and enjoy it to its full potential.
