                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration behind this build was to experiment with new hardware taking a well known simple game and giving it a bit of a technical upgrade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, by using the Leap Motion controller, the game is able to recognize hand location and gestures over the controller. Therefore the user will execute directed motions controlling the game of Tetris.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this program in Java along with using the Leap-MotionSDK. The Leap-Motion API was extremely well documented and useful allowing this build to be completed over the course of 36 hours. First, I programmed the game of Tetris controlled by basic KeyEvents. Then I experimented with the Leap-Motion controller and API independent of the game. Once I was familiar with the API and controller functionality I was able to connect the game and the controller, sending translating gestures to KeyEvents and mapping the hand location over the controller to the location of the bricks onto the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges I faced was creating gestures and mapping the hand over the controller correctly to the Tetris game display. Many times I ran into issues were the games functionality suffered due to slow or innaccurate gesture readings. Therefore, the main challenges were faced in smoothing the control of the game using the Leap Motion controller.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am glad that for the most part the controls of the game are user-friendly. I am also proud that I successfully integrated Leap-Motions API into this build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to sift through SDK documentation and create a project with corresponding libraries in reference to the SDK's API. This was my opportunity to use an API so I am glad I was able to accomplish a build and learn a lot along the way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VirtualTetris
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would still like to continually refine the gesture and motion tracking. Along side this, implementing a better user interface,create user accounts, collect user high scores. Is what I hope is next for VirtualTetris.
