                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeFiner has been building a one-stop investment platform. Wyre and Kyber have been used as a utility tool to help users to swap tokens for investment. We want to further extend the user experience to integrate Xpring with easy investment using Compound investment platform. We want to integrate xSpring, Compound and DeFiner Saving Pool as a one-click user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this hackathon project, we build out a streamline automatic workflow. The flow allows user to deposit any currency (USD, Bitcoin, Ether) supported by Xpring into mint Compound cDai, thus start to earn compound interest in one click!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built on the DeFiner investment platform Trade Exchange page. The pages would call Xpring API to convert any supported tokens to DAI. We then call Compound contract interface mint() to exchange the DAI with cDAI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compound API is not intuitive on withdrawing DAI out of Compound account. All calls are successful but DAI and cDAI was not exchanged during withdrawing.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The power of exchange to any currency using Xpring create all the possible integration with different Ethereum dApp. Compound is only a start, there are unlimited options to integrate to provide great user experience.

                    What's next for Crosschain Automatic Earning Flow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crosschain Automatic Earning Flow will continue to be improved and enhance to be the integral part of DeFiner investment platform. It will be further enhanced to DeFiner's new release Saving Pool to complete the user flow.
