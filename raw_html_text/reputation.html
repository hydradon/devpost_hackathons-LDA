                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired from an episode of Black Mirror where users are scored based on their popularity.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It accesses your social media followers from many platforms (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin) and assigns a raw score based on how popular you are. This score is calculated based on likes, follows, and general engagement.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product is an iOS application that uses the iOS-centric APIs of social media companies. We also used various third-party frameworks in order to speed up development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we attempted to integrate Instagram and Twitter, we discovered that they had shut down their iOS APIs. The LinkedIn API wasn't updated to support iOS 12. The only one that really worked was Facebook, as they had kept their tools up to date.
