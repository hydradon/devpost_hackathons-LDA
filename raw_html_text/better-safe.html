                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App is built with the expo toolkit on react-native framework
We chose this front-end stack as it aloud us to learn new technologies that we had not worked with before
We also chose to use the firebase platform for out back-end as that was simple to set up given the time constraints
                </p>

                    Time, Complexity, Fatiuge and lots of coffee

                <p>
                    It a small amount of time, with limited resources we have created an extensible platform which can be adapted with little friction to many other need and an idea that can be extended to much greater heights.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
