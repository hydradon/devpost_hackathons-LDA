                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 1,000 days of operating as a communications engineer in war zones around the world gave me an amazing idea:
                </p>
                <p>
                    How about we, as a startup, build a system to solve the communications problems every single person in joint special operations are having on a daily basis?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set out to do just that, and created a Task Force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TF Ninja!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The TUF Kit equips the warfighter with powerful facial-recognition software in a ridiculously tiny package while creating your own network on the move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An onboard deep neural-network (DNN) and a infrared camera using GPU-accelerated architecture provides trainable computer-vision. An SSD with encrypted data-at-rest provides secure recording. Our proprietary breadcrumb networking allows for last-mile connectivity and low-bandwidth live-streaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TUF Kit solves the communication gaps that currently plague forward-deployed infrastructure, in an affordable solution that thrives on modularity, adaptability, and ease of deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed the challenge over the past two weeks when Off The Grid was announced. Size, weight, bandwidth, and universal-utility, were the biggest challenges going into this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using commercial parts (COTS), mostly open-source software, and some unique patent-pending designs and utilities as of Friday May 17th, we set out to execute the idea this weekend to hack our solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Correct amperage for power. Cooling/heat dissipation. Proper software. Missing pin-connectors, headers - little things that impeded progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3D printing had lack of adhesion to build-plate, leading to warping.  Redesign of enclosure to to improve durability, reduce size, spark joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper paperwork submission / organization. Cognitive overload stifled decision-making processes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re finally building something people actually want!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being able to provide tools other teams needed.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                        then

                    lead and speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remain flexible, adapt to changes, continue to revise, reiterate, and grow.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Deploy in next training scenarios (MLAT, Akademi, SOROC/SONOC)

                    An angel (1x pref, non-participating) or a contract (SDVOSB/MOSB Sole-Source, OTA) would be nice to allow us to continue development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TUF Kit integrates with stuff other startups are doing:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video-compression better than h.264, better cross-platform image compression, AR headsets, really awesome batteries, centimeter accurate GPS, adaptive-waveform metamaterials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This let&rsquo;s us accomplish:
