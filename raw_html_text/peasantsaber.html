                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone loves BeatSaber, but not everyone can afford to drop $500 on a full VR set to play the game, especially broke college students. So we decided to create a similar rhythm game called PeasantSaber - BeatSaber for the peasants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PeasantSaber uses hand recognition technology to allow you to play a simplified version of beatsaber right from your computer's webcam. We also wrote python scripts to allow you to design your own levels given an audio file for the music.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built in python with Tensorflow, OpenCV, and some audio processing libraries.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was the first time we implemented multiprocessing threads, and we ran into a ton of issues - especially with passing variables between our worker threads and main thread.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use and structure a Queue to pass data between threads was probably our greatest accomplishment. This was a bug spent hours debugging and most online tutorials didn't help because all of our worker threads were running in infinite loops unlike most examples where the function call would end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about multiprocessing and how it is used in machine learning applications.
