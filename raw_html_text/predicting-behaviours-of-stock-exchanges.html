                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with an idea if there are any correlations between NYSE and other Asian Market, how one market can affect the movement of prices in the other.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our brief programme only shows graphs so far about how much they are correlated and we found out they have some correlations and follow some trends. It takes the index of exchanges as signals.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and API from yahoo finance to obtain opening and closing prices of NYSE and NIKKEI. We calculated % returns and regressions between these two markets trying to find a pattern.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add more elements into it as our R squared value is bit too low (about 5%) but we assume there will be markets they are more correlated to each other and if add elements such as a volatility of one market can affect the other or a volume of one market can affect the other market; how a quite day of NYSE will affect the movement of stocks in NIKKEI the following day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are actually proud that we found some correlations between NIKKEI and NYSE even though it wasn't great.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is new to python and some of us don't have any experience in coding but we were able to learn how API works and about pandas, numpy, and other crucial features.

                    What's next for Predicting Behaviours of Stock Exchanges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more elements in our calculations so we can find more correlations between markets. We need to find out formulas, more dataset and more deep knowledge in python. We had an idea of creating a machine that analysis a chart pattern. If we could find which stock exchanges correlates the most, and narrow down to find which stocks to buy or sell.
