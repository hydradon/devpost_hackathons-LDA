                    ByteMe Understands and Knows You! Just tell it what foods you like and it will notify you with when and where any of your favorite foods is being served just in time for you to make dinner plans with friends and loved ones. Oh..and just in case none of your faves are available, ByteMe offers a quick glance at the menu.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly with Android Studio. We built a backend that syncs daily and fetches the day's menu from the Bon Appetit Website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us on this team are first time android developers and it took quite some time to get a UI that was even remotely close to "friendly".
For our backend, we had to parse the somewhat messy data from the Bon Appetit website and to get an actual menu.
Integrating front and back end was quite hard. Turns out fetching data from a site in android was a totally different story from just fetching the data using a script written in Java. We are still trying to figure out how to do the background sync and initial data fetch on a separate thread from the main thread.
Oh and finally...
The BonApetit site went down at 4am today just as we sucessfully integrated front and backend.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have an online server that fetches data from "menu sites" of other universities and extend our services beyond Carleton. Any member of college or company with a cafeteria will find that app pretty useful.
