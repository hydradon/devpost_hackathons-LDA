                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that everyone can use with their real life problems. Everyone has experienced being stuck in awkward positions, so this app will solve that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app will make a fake call to the phone so the user will have a reason to get out of an awkward situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security issues with vibrate, making it work on different types of Android phones, and the design of deceiving others.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a fully functioning app that everyone can use. This was our first Android developed application that our team has ever created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's very difficult to make an app that deceive others.
