                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All CUNY students have difficult searching for the best classes that fits their schedule, and hava great professors based on ratemyprofessor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You used the same login credentials that you use on CUNY portal which will get all the required courses listed on degree works. Using that information we search for all classes for each course that the student requires, and returns the class with the best professor ratings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NodeJS for building a simple API that has all the courses in every CUNY school and Python for webscraping. All services are hosted on AWS EC2
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning we had to deal with retrieving data from a website that was created with outdated technology.
Every school has a different department code for similar courses. Example: HIS is a department code in some CUNYs while HIST is as well a department code in other CUNYs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete the main goal. Search for classes for you that could fit your schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that CUNY should update their site for security reasons due it being poorly created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CUNY 2nd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add message board functionality for each course enrolled
Add a class notifier by receiving a text that you have class in one hour.
