                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps some of the most common injuries involve the hand, arm, and wrist. With thousands of Americans affected by these conditions every year, it is important for those people to receive proper treatment. However, with rising healthcare costs, it is becoming increasingly difficult for those affected to have access to these medical specialists. We were motivated to provide a more affordable option that is quick and trackable in order to aid in recovery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyoTherapy uses the Myo Armband to guide users through a series of exercises to rehabilitate and track their progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo Armband was used to detect electrical signals to measure muscle strength and certain gestures that are generally used in therapy. The user interface was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use the Myo Armband and syncing it to a custom user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Differentiating between subtle movements and finding ways to quantify factors such as progress over time, range of motion, and strength.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the Myo Armband and its capabilities, how to use hardware with a lot of application development, and how to deploy web applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyoTherapy #46
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More experiments to determine the parameters for detecting gestures, more exercises to aid in therapy.
