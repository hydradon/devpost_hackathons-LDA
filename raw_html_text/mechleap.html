                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that if we combined our heads and hands together, we could create the ultimate game. However, seeing that that was physically impossible to mash us together, we did the next best thing-- we created a giant robot to make
                    <em>
                        one
                    </em>
                    of us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you ever feel like you were really small and insignificant in this giant world? Not anymore! Now you can be large and insignificant in this giant world.
By combining the capabilities of the Oculus Rift and the Leap Motion Sensor, we produce a simulation game that allows users to control a giant mechanical robot. The simple controls are used to eradicate the enemies that fly towards the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning on Unity, we created a basic mechanical robot that could move throughout the level. Atop of this, we added a cockpit where the player would be situated in. Initially, we only used the virtual reality headset to give the player a sense of immersion with an Xbox controller to engage in the movements. Then, we built upon this system with Leap Motion Sensor that could allow a player's free-moving hand motions be captured within the game. This enhanced the simulation experience to enable interactions with levers and switches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally did not know what an efficient means of controlling the mech would be as the Xbox controller lacked the level of immersion we desired. We then discovered that the MLH Hardware Lab had an available Leap Motion Sensor that could be used to record and utilize hand gestures. There was a learning curve involved with using both the VR Headset and Motion Sensor as they were devices whose experiences were new to us, much less their code. Sometimes the VR's display would give us motion sickness as we tested trials that prompted us to make the camera stabilized.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually got some sleep.
We made our first VR game even though this was some of the team's first time even using the medium. We developed our own creative means of solving the various issues that arose (such as a mech that kept falling over) by adding vertical forces or other knowledge (wow, those physics lessons paid off). 
We made the wise choice to use Pepe as the approaching enemies during our test runs to really scare the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used our individual background knowledge to come together with what we each could bring to the table. Aside from all the technical knowledge we had to gain to finish the project, we were also proud of our ability to create an immersive experience that placed players into a whole different reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MechLeap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pepe will be the next enemies. One day.
We hope to also improve the fluidity of controls and levers, while also adding new actions. With a more accurate control scheme from an improved usage of the Motion Sensor, players will be able to cross over the gap between reality and virtual reality. We certainly want more variety in what players can do in the game as well as the background scenery. You'll have to wait and see!
