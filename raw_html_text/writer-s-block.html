                <p>
                    As a writer myself, there are several moments when I feel stuck. At these times, some friendly motivation is always welcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives you a motivational quote from a famous writer about writer's block, to help you tide through your own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Writer's Block
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to make a contextually aware skill that helps writers with different quotes based on what kind of writing they do - e.g. fiction and non-fiction writers may be motivated by different things.
