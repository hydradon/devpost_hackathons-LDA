                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DataHop is building the next-generation mobile CDN by means of using users&rsquo; devices to distribute content locally and off-line using a new smart device-to-device connectivity solution. DataHop incorporates a blockchain-based reward system that uses a new consensus algorithm in order to reward users according to their contribution to the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DataHop allows user devices (smartphones) to exchange information locally in an &ldquo;offline-first&rdquo; manner (without relying on Internet connectivity). This is achieved by taking advantage of the storage capacity and network connectivity opportunities of end-user devices. Users&nbsp;&ldquo;store-carry-and-forward&rdquo; content, acting as data mules as they move around densely-populated urban environments making use of the hundreds of transfer opportunities in places such as trains, restaurants, coffee shops and workplaces.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    DataHop aims to change the centralised nature of downloading data by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exchanging content directly between users in an information-centric way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Incentivising content propagation using the Proof-of-Prestige reward scheme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Visualising node interactions in a user-friendly way.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Content Providers
                </h3>
                <p>
                    DataHop will disseminate content providers&rsquo; media content, reducing their CDN costs and effectively acting as a purely mobile content distribution network. It also improves users' experience where lack of good connectivity hinders content retrieval.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Proof-of-Prestige
                </h3>
                <p>
                    DataHop is developing a new smart reward system for users that help diseminating content using a blockchain solution. The DataHop reward system will be based on a new &ldquo;useful work reward system&rdquo; for unverifiable tasks, called&nbsp;Proof-of-Prestige. Proof of Prestige is a layer-2 protocol that can run on top of any Proof-of-Stake blockchain.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Example Usage
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If BBC wants to distribute a film, it currently has to spend millions of pounds on content delivery networks (CDN). Using DataHop, only a few nodes would be required to get the content directly from the cloud, which can then be disseminated locally using device-to-device connectivity.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Proof-of-Prestige Proof of Concept using Cosmos and Tendermint as a Proof-of-Stake solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build our solution we implemented the next functionalities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integrated an Android app allowing users to exchange content using Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi Direct.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow the Android app to submit transfer confirmation to the blockchain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a Cosmos-based blockchain implementation using Proof of Prestige reward scheme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make Tendermint consensus protocol use prestige values instead of stake.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a visualisation module reading data from the blockchain and presenting them in a user-friendly way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated all the modules using JSON/REST-based communication.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proof-of-Prestige is a state-of-the-art reward scheme that has never been implemented before this hackathon. Running it on top of a Proof-of-Stake blockchain is non-trivial at the moment, and it required us to modify the core behaviour of the consensus protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In just two days, we have found a novel use-case for a state-of-the-art reward scheme on the blockchain and managed to integrate it into recently-developed frameworks. Without any prior knowledge of Go or Cosmos, we have built a functional application that can be accessed from different devices and leverages the decentralised nature of blockchain.
                </p>
