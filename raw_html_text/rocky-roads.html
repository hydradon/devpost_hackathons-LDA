                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    11, 400 tracked deaths &amp; many more untracked ones, last year in India alone due to potholes, bumps, improper roads
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a vehicle drives over a pothole/bumps/roadblocks, etc, the motion sensor records the severity of the jolt, tags it with the vehicle's geographic location, couple it with the satellite images for that location and uploads it to the cloud. Specialized software can then eliminate anomalies, cancel out duplicate reports, and generate an individualized &ldquo;safety report&rdquo; for roads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using combination of data sources &mdash; readings from vertical accelerometer (mobile phone) &amp; GPS (mobile phone / sensor in combination with here maps) and satellite images (youmapps)  &mdash; to automatically record nasty bumps in the road.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team formation - our developer got unwell suddenly yesterday and I had to make back-up plans in very short time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A prototype that can actually be used to help community, society going forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scale of the problem - we assumed it to be much lesser than actual. 
New coding hacks
Team building in pressure situations
