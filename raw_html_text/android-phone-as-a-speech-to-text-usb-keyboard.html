                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a software engineering student who's developed a finger condition that makes it impossible to type with my fingers without causing pain and inflammation. I get around this using

                    , but this is sub-optimal because it's slow, and still causes strain.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in speech voice commands and outputs text, macros, code, etc. It's seen as a USB keyboard by computers, and doesn't require any drivers to be installed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patch my phone's kernel to allow it to be seen as a USB keyboard using Linux's HID Gadget functionality. An app uses this to send key presses. CMUSphinx (an open-source speech-to-text engine) interprets speech, which is turned into key presses and commands.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to build a kernel took 5+ hours. Patching it took a lot of research about Linux's USB subsystem.
