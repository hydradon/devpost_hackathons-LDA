                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in how much the STM actually serves the population of the island of Montreal and how difficult it is for people to get around town in underserved locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using databases from the city of Montreal and from the STM, the program formats and analyzes the data to give out a rating for every borough of Montreal based on how many people live in the borough, the boroughs size and the amount of STM bus stops in the borough.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A python backend that uses the google maps API and STM datasets. An HTML and haskell front end to display the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the google geo coding api to map  (latitude, longitude)-&gt;borough was a difficult task to accomplish. We were limited by the amount of requests we could to make to the api by 25000 and we had to &gt;9000 data points the needed to pass to the function. Thus we did not really have room for much error. Our solution was to write the data that was returned by the api to a file so that it would be stored and so we would limit the amount off requests we make.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to scrape the massive amount of data (one file was 9k+ lines long) to produce a result.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Websites/Servers, using API's. Dataset analysis and parsing.
