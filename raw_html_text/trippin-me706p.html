                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    @KellyFlood - She really wanted to have an app to help her easily plan day trips. It's hard finding events that don't conflict with each other, so we wanted an app that can do it for us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Theoretically, this app will plan a day trip for you by finding nearby locations and events within your price range. The app selects the most popular locations and events and considers possible scheduling conflicts to determine the optimal day trip according to your parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to design the interface and logic and Google Places API to link price levels and user ratings of local attractions to optimize the user's day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever used Android or APIs before, and only one of us had even seen Git. A couple of us had used java, but in general, the entire syntax and process was foreign to all of us. Moreover none of us have ever attended an event like this before, so there was a very steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an android app and made HUGE progress towards utilizing APIs. None of us had even heard of an Activity or knew that the Android Studio primarily used Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android studio and some progress towards using APIs. Additionally, we learned what Hackathons are like, and how to learn in this experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for Trippin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement pricing for Ubers or public transportation! Plan the day based off average time spent at each attraction or restaurant.
