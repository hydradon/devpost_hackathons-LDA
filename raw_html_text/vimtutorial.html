                    How I built it

                    Used Java Swing.

                <p>
                    It's been years since I've programmed in Java, let alone Swing.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swing is outdated. Use JavaFX next time. 
MVC is a godsend when done correctly. Next time, figure out how to do MVC (in given language) before start of event.
