                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The space theme inspired us to create a game due to brainstorming a 3-D spherical map like a planet. Space would allow a lot of creativity for different type of planets and environments to come up with, such as ores, plants and terrain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows the user to explore a planet to collect resources. More planets and a vast variety of terrain/levels are planned for the future. Collecting resources would help build and expand the space base currently being built by their society to help research and the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Unity &amp; C# to make the game for it's 3-D aspects. We also used blender to create 3-D assets such as the different ores on the planet. Mangastudio was used to draw the opening cut scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time using Unity such as coding and its scripts. We ran into challenges such as syntax. It took a while to adapt to the different language to create some features such as the progress bar &amp; oxygen tank bar. Another issue we ran into was git. We are both very unfamiliar with it and this was our first time actually using it for a larger collaborative project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm personally proud of the art and 3-D models I was able to create. In addition I like the art style of the game so far. We are also proud of getting the movements of the character to work as we expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity has a lot of method syntax to learn and get used to. There are a lot of tools and methods to help make a solid game despite inexperience.
                </p>

                    What's next for Space Source

                <p>
                    Adding more levels and fixing the opening.
