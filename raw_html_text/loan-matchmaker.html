                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even's fintech API provided all the inspiration here. This API is the perfect service to match consumers with the loans they need to hit the ground running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app uses the Even Fintech API to pair users with loan providers. It takes data entered by the user in the form on the front page and passes it through to the Even API in the form of a JSON object. It then takes each loan that comes back from the API and converts it into an object, forms an array of these objects, and displays the properties of each loan to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored the API using GET and POST requests and determined this would be the ideal app to make. We build the back end in such a way that the front end can be changed without a hassle. Objects are created in the back end and sent through the the API, which returns objects whose properties are then read. The classes we created are testable and their properties are fully tested using Jasmine and Karma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running through the design and building process in under 24 hours was a major challenge.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined our knowledge and successfully applied it to this project in a short period of time. Our team is proud of how we came together quickly and each member took on tasks without being prompted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively incorporate Even's API into a functional web app.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Loan Matchmaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps we will build the online marketplace around the app, or turn the app into a  plugin for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or any other web browser so it could be included in any commercial website.
