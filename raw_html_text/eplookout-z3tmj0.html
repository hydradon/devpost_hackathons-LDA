                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration started with a really small problem: An easier way to take attendance. We wanted to use facial recognition technology to automize taking attendance in the classroom. However, then we deviated into the security aspect of the project which led to the beginning of differentiating between a criminal and a normal person.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a program that compares an image with features of a face with another set of pictures and tells you whether that face matches with a set of bad people, or "criminals"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and a lot of sweat and tears
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our setup (laptops) sucked. Compatibility issues, version issues, brain damage, low morality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we actually built something we can present
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never give up.
