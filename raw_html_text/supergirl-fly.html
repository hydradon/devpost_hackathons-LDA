                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;I do not wish [women] to have power over men; but over themselves.&rdquo; -- Mary Wollstonecraft
Due to the prevailing injustices that women face, we were inspired to create an interactive game that advocates women's rights and empowers young girls to overcome female stigmas.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users have to avoid obstacles that resemble the stereotypes that surround women on a daily basis. Once a player hits an obstacle, they lose, and learn simple ways to take steps towards exercising their rights and be inspired by motivational phrases.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to code an iOS app from scratch. Using a multitude of platforms, we were able to design custom graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When writing this app, we had to debug the project multiple times. Also, our project is a physics-based game. As a result, making sure the sprites collided at the right times was one of the most difficult challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though this was our first hackathon, we were able to get a running app done in such as short time. We&rsquo;re proud that we came together to make sure the graphics, presentation and the app itself is working correctly without bugs. 
We are proud of ultimately being able to create a complete bug free app that is for the better good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used Swift before, so we learned the basic functionalities of the language. We had also never been to a hackathon before so we were able to bring our ideas to life for the first time. We learned a lot about each other&rsquo;s strengths and talents and thus able to maximize them. We learned that there is not one way to solve a problem when coding but rather multiple.

                    What's next for SuperGirl Fly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the current game, we hope to integrate a communication system to allow girls to interact with and encourage each other. In the future, we strive for SuperGirl Fly to be commercialized so that the proceeds can benefit charitable organizations that advocate for women&rsquo;s rights. SuperGirl Fly sees the addition of more games as well is more obstacles in the current game. These game would include those focused on the older population to tackle the topics of abortion, sexual violence, and abuse.
