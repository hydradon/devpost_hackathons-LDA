                </h2>

                    Istanbul, a popular JavaScript code coverage tool

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puppeteer to Istanbul is part of the Istanbul GitHub organization and allows for a more elegant way
to display code coverage that is pulled from Google Chrome using Puppeteer. This type of debugging
makes it so that developers can test a variety of specific behaviors that involve DOM manipulation that
can be impossible to test without Puppeteer. Without our tool, however, developers testing with Puppeteer 
could not test their code coverage to ensure they tested thoroughly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We converted from the Puppeteer coverage output to the V8 engine coverage format, and then
integrates with an existing tool (V8toIstanbul) to take the V8  engine's code coverage format and
convert it to Istanbul. Our project is a Node project with thorough testing and high code coverage
as well as many example scripts to test our functionality, ensuring that it will work as intended.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code coverage processes of Puppeteer are complex and obscure, and it was hard to understand
what the coverage output specifically meant, and how it could be best converted into the format that we
needed.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed a library that maps Puppeteer's code coverage output to Instanbul, 
and created a splash page for our project (found at

                    What's next for Puppeteer to Istanbul
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be updating the Puppeteer documentation in order to reflect our better approach
to coverage, and will be informing the Istanbul community (who requested a tool to convert from
Puppeteer output to Istanbul).
