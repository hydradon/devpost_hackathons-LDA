                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we recounted our personal experiences with traumatic events such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. 
We reflected upon these difficult times and contemplated the actions that could have been taken to alleviate or improve the situation that we or those close to us were in and decided to build these resources into an application for emergency response operations. 
This idea was born with the affected citizen's needs and wellbeing as the utmost priority.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to provide an application for the alerting and tracking of evacuation operations. 
Through this application we will track the location of evacuees and provide guidance to collection points based off of their most immediate needs.
Through this portal, end users in emergency situations will be able to request the type of aid that they need and know when they should anticipate recieving it.
                    <br>
                    The information gathered by this application and the collection points will enable first responders to make informed decisions with real time data to prioritize their rescue efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a responsive web application to provide the end users with centralized access to the resources that they need to survive. 
We built this web application using HTML/CSS/JS and integrations with ArcGIS to bring the most accurate map data for enhanced response capabilities.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges that we ran into as a team revolved around communication. There are many right ways to attack a problem and determining the best route to take is a difficult choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to create such a complete visualization of what the application is capable of. We are proud that we were able to bring together such a large team in a synchronized effort to make a difference in the lives of evacuees.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to prioritize effective team communication above everything else. Building an application to have a significant impact is more than a single person can handle and developing a team that can efficiently weave together the different skills of members from a diverse set of backgrounds is difficult but critical to success.

                    We'll take a look at lessons that we've learned and how we can apply them to situations that we will encounter in the future.
