                <p>
                    The idea was concluded by combining  the case studies related to Behavior and habit tracking section in the kit announced at the hackathon ,

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    after the brainstorming we did about the app and discussing the based features of the app , we separate the tasks into 3 ,and as we are group of 4 the tasks separated as follows :
 one handle the widget implementation , two of us implement the database and manage habits ,and the last one is responsible for the graph generating and finding the added value to the app .
