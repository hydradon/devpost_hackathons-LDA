                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stuck in traffic on Hwy 401
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proof-of-concept for cars in smart cities to manage traffic data and find the shortest path to destination based on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Floyd Warshall algorithm used to find the fastest path to destination. Front-end developed using JavaFX and Swing library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the appropriate algorithm for our scenario among other shortest path algorithms such as Dijikstra and Bellman-Ford. Developed front-end in HTML and CSS but soon realized that the GUI needs to be updated constantly so had to resort to JavaFX and Swing since HTML and CSS are static for the most part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed the algorithm and a front-end for it within 24 hours. Met new friends along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various shortest path algorithms, how they function and how to implement them. Should decide early on in SDLC which tools are appropriate to ensure that no time is wasted developing GUI in HTML and CSS and then using JavaFX and Swing since they are more appropriate for our scenario.

                <p>
                    Use with real data on large scale to ensure that proof-of-concept works in actual scenario.
