                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know that every teenager, including us, deals with stress, and we wanted to find a way to relieve some of the pressures that come along with school.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program asks the user a series of questions and adapts to those responses to cater to their mood, using jokes and inspirational quotes in the process.
                </p>

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first time coding, we were not sure of what we were capable of creating or the means of doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning how to code using python in 8 hours and having a project here to present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code and that even though it seemed intimidating at first, we were able to overcome this apprehension by practicing and attending the workshops.
