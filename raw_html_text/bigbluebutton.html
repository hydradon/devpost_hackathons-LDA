                    BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system that enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and desktop sharing.

                <h1>
                    Story Behind BigBlueButton
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Open Source
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built BigBlueButton on a full open-source stack.  The key components are FreeSWITCH (for sending/receiving audio) and red5, an open source implementation of a RTMP server.   The desktop sharing uses a Java applet for sending the presenter's desktop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a synchronous tool that enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and desktop is quite an undertaking.  The project was started in 2008 and has a team of core developers steadily building, hardening, and integrating BigBlueButton with other applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have released twelve versions of the project and it's localized into 35 languages.  We use WebRTC for the audio (very high-quality audio for the student).
                </p>

                <p>
                    BigBlueButton's application desktop sharing currently uses Java.  It works, but it (a) requires the presenter to run Java and (b) isn't fast enough for sharing graphic intensive applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to use WebRTC for high-quality desktop sharing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would achieve two goals
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The presenter would not require any additional software (using FireFox or Chrome)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students would get a higher-quality on-line learning experience (this is our mission)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We're working on an HTML5 client for BigBlueButton as well.  With desktop sharing via WebRTC, viewers of the HTML5 client running on Android will be able to see the presenter's desktop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Desktop sharing takes a large amount of bandwidth -- especially as the screens get larger (hello 4K).  With large numbers of students, the amount of bandwidth scales linearly.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's a quick video we did of getting the WebRTC desktop sharing going through to the BigBlueButton client.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This will give all students a high-quality view of the presenter's desktop.
