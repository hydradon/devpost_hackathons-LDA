                <p>
                    As I have gotten older, my yearly physical is no longer straightforward.  More tests need to be performed, my physician scolds me more for my bad decisions (I do have a bit of a sugar addiction), and I have more questions than ever on how to live a healthier lifestyle.  But the appointments have barely increased in length.  So, I took some inspiration from a
                    <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/news/can-text-message-help-bridge-%E2%80%98word-gap%E2%80%99-low-income-children" rel="nofollow">

                    study on increasing parental involvement in early childhood education except with the goal to increase health literacy among adults.  I then added some image analysis to identify the foods I want to eat but then suggest something that is a little better for me but still satisfies that craving.  Finally, rather than scramble at my yearly physical for what questions I should be asking my physician, I want some sample questions on demand that will make me have an intelligent conversation with my physician.

                <p>
                    Nyota Health Connect sends regular messages about health topics you might find useful like stress, diabetes, nutrition, etc. to help increase your health literacy.  She also allows you to send her a picture to get back insights on how to satisfy your food cravings (less 2pm cookies and more apples to satisfy that afternoon slump) using some help with the data found from the CDC.  Finally, Nyota has an intent that allows you to get ideas for questions to ask your doctor so you can maximize your time in the room before that bell rings and your appointment is over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is not to remove clinicians or even augment them but to make better use of the short time a person will have at their appointment.  By using Nyota Health Connect everyday, people will increase their health literacy, make smarter health decisions more often, and will be able to converse on a more meaningful level with their physician during their appointments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nyota Health Connect also has an analytics solution that can help stakeholders make product level decisions by seeing how the user's behave from a high level.  This could be a missed connection (pun very much intended) when a user types something the NLP does not understand, analyzing the user's sentiment across a conversation not just in a single message, or just finding image labels that do not exist yet in the nutrition DB and should be added later.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    MongoDB handles about 90% of the bot with Stitch handling the computation, Atlas storing data for analytics and user profiles, and of course Charts to help me find different insights into the data of my bot to help drive design decisions.  The other 10% is run on GCP to handle the AI with Dialogflow for natural language processing, Google Vision for image analysis, and Google Natural Language to gather insights into missed conversations so I might augment what intents Nyota can handle.

                    Users can access Nyota Health Connect on Facebook Messenger and SMS.  Messages with public health information are all thoroughly researched and have citations available; we don't need to spread fake news.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first-time using MongoDB so there was a bit of a learning curve.  Originally proactive messaging was going to be an issue since it would mean I would need a third-party scheduler to hit a public webhook on MongoDB Stitch but then about a month ago, scheduled triggers was added which made my life way easier with regards to security.  Also, I could not figure out how to read incoming attachments with the built-in Twilio service on Stitch so I built my own using the incoming webhook so Nyota Health Connect could help give advice on how to satisfy food cravings on both Facebook Messenger and SMS.

                <p>
                    I have always wanted to build an analytics solution for bots and I always wanted to learn MongoDB so this hackathon was perfect to combine these two desires.  However, the biggest accomplishment I am proud of is Nyota Health Connect herself since she solves a problem I have been having and do see a big market opportunity to serve.  I don't just mean giving away the core product away for free to users to have more informed conversations with their physicians but the added features I hope to add in the future to make it easier for users to manage their care and their loved one's care.
