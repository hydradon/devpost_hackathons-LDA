                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give back to the community and we thought that an app like this already existed, once we found out there were no apps like this, we decided to make one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps tracks of peoples' pills and reminds them when the time is getting close to take their pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github for version control,
MongoDB and Stitch for data ,
Ionic for cross platform,
HTML for UI,
JS for functions,
CSS for styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our skill sets did no overlap very much, so it was initially difficult to find a framework that we could all utilize effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to effectively utilize stitch and ionic, two technologies that none of us were familiar with, and that are cutting edge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB, Stitch, JS, HTML, CSS, Python, Angular, JSON, JQuery,
                </p>

                    What's next for Lifeline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly getting doctors on board using it, refill reminders, integrating with pharmacies to get more accurate data, and possibly even live help.
