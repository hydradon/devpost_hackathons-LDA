                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The digital Insurance Track and OF COURSE our big interest in AI, especially chatbots.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iBot is a chat application that helps you find the insurences that fit you best. Just have a talk to iBot and get your insurences recommended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After long consideration we chose SAP Conversational AI as our natural language processor. Alongside we have a Spring backend as well as an Angular frontend application to use our bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how Conversational AI works and how Bot APIs work in general as well as how to connect those features to our own logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy to get a pretty much functional application including custom user interface as well as a backend with database integration and also a working chatbot that recognises user intents and personal information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to draft a full application and divide into more and less important part as well as share the work in a team. Time management and of course new technology like AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better language recognition, more detailed dialoges, bigger frontend and extendable backend logic.
                </p>
