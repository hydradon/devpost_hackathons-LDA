                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After watching the movie, 'Blade Runner,' and seeing the device they use to detect emotional responses from the humans and their replicants (genetically engineered laborers) to better tell them apart, I got the inspiration to develop a polygraph machine for humans that operates via a webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application detects a user's heart rate visually via a webcam and, along with other sensors, displays metrics relating to a user's stress level. The application can also be simultaneously used as a medical device because of the metrics it is measuring, much like the healthcare robot 'Baymax' from Disney's Big Hero 6.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was getting everything that should have been working, in theory, to work in practice. Everything from the heart rate algorithm to plotting our metrics in real-time required heavy optimization and testing to work.

                <p>
                    Getting a finished product that works reasonably well. It was satisfying to this completed
