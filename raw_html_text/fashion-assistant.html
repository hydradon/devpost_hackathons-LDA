                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every morning I get up and get breakfast and usually I ask my mom "What should I wear today?" which usually results in her telling me how cold it is outside and that i need to wear massive layers of clothes. I ended up resorting to going to accuweather every morning but that became time consuming. I wanted to make something that I could ask "what should I wear" and it would tell me what to wear based off the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls location data from the Alexa, puts the zipcode received from that through a zip code API (zipcodeapi.com) and then receives the latitude and longitude from it to put into Darksky's API (darksky.net). It uses the apparent temperature from that to then decide which outfit would be best. I also wanted to include implementation for color combinations, but since those are fairly objective I stuck to checking to see if the colors were practical for the weather (light colors for warm temperatures, dark colors for cooler temperatures).

                    Alexa SDK, AWS Lambda backend (using node.js, the one true dev language), Darksky's API and the Zipcode API. also lots and lots of documentation and example projects. (see:

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a lot of firsts for me. First time using Node.JS, first time making an Alexa skill or an AWS Lambda function, first time using and API and having to parse it. I also had a ton of dumb bugs along the way, including but not limited to using "&gt;" instead of "&gt;=", stringifying a string, and possibly the dumbest one: repeatedly testing location using the simulator and getting errors when the docs clearly state to test it on the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made something I can actually use on a daily basis and hopefully other people can use too. I'm also confident in my API parsing skills now too. Also the fact that I started this project in like February and then in late April Amazon came out with their own fashion assistant, but with a camera is pretty cool too.

                <p>
                    Maybe integrate it with the new Echo Look. If pinterest or polyvore had API's for style trends (what colors go with what) I would probably integrate that. Also more settings to customize it to a user (gender preference, style preferences, etc.).
