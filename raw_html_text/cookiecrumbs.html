                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see the cookies that are stored about people online and how they are used. This has come from our interest in cyber security
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can input a URL, and a table is returned showing all of the cookies (and the data stored) that are collected by the URL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Python. From there we decided upon using Django to run our server. It currently only works in Chrome as a Chrome based library was used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything (mostly Django not working the way we expected)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new framework, structure of cookies, http requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CookieCrumbs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who knows, possibly a browser extension and adding some stats about the types of cookies stored and whether they're passed between sites
                </p>
