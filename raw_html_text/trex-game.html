                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to develop something that was fun (not necessarily a "world-saving application") and could be completed in the given time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a command line version of the "T-Rex Game", famously available on the Chrome Browser. 
Goal:  "Make the T-Rex jump over the cacti without hitting it ".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the curses library in Python for the graphics and used ASCII characters to create the characters of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge was to synchronize the events so that the characters render on the screen correctly! Since the curses library does a character-by-character update, its relatively difficult to move objects in the same scene at different speeds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important task was to replicate/redraw the characters using ASCII characters. I believe that the characters have come out pretty well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working with the Curses library for the very first time. Though I will not be using it in the future (due to limited usability), I dived into a different style of application programming. In the end, I enjoyed the working on this project and even though it does not solve "Global Warming", I hope this version of the "T-Rex" game will make people laugh!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trex-Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the journey for T-Rex Game ends here! But if I were to improve upon it, I would definitely want to add the next levels of the game which includes the day-night change and the "Pterodactyl", flying dinosaur.
