                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this project because our school is notoriously bad at sorting trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web game helps teach people how to properly recycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js for a simple backend and HTML/CSS/JS for frontend. Bootstrap and p5.js (processing for JavaScript) helped significantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had never used p5.js before, so learning how to use it was a big challenge. Learning JavaScript was another challenge we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are firstly proud that we finished it. We are happy to say that we learned a great amount in completing this project. The project has potential to bring change, another fact which we are very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important thing we learned was how to collaborate as a team via Github. Learning Github can sometimes take forever, so we are very happy that it didn't for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Go Recycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more complexity to the game in the form of more levels, a database, and improved webpage styling.
                </p>
