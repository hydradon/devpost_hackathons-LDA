                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A carbon footprint is a measure of carbon dioxide emissions associated with an entity&rsquo;s activities. According to a paper from researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, people with the lowest usage of energy are still producing, on average, more than double the global per-capita average of carbon output (and the average American produces about 20 tons of carbon dioxide each year).

                <p>
                    In order for us to maintain a habitable planet, we need to address this problem immediately. Therefore, we chose to build a website that keeps users aware of the carbon output they generate, and in doing so, help make better lifestyle decisions starting from the mode of transportation they use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website will take in the starting location and destination input from the user. It will then fetch the google maps API to calculate the trip duration, as well as the number of miles for your trip. From there we will calculate the amount of carbon footprint for the 4 popular modes of transport: Walk, Bike, Transit, and Drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and WixCode for function calls, database manipulation, and API calls. Google Cloud Platform was used to reference Directions API and Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several major problems we ran into. First, we had a bit of trouble resolving the JSON and calling the API used for determining the time required to reach the final destination. We were able to work through this bug using the console log. After this, we continued having trouble generating and inputting maps into the webpage. While we were able to complete this task, the iframe object had limited access to our desired data storage in building the map. Other than these, there were minor challenges we had to overcome (especially when it came to javascript syntax), but overall, we feel that we were able to successfully address the problem we chose.

                    What's next for NaviGreen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand the NaviGreen project into a more committed program, where users can track their carbon output over periods of time. We believe that today's society would like to be greener, and so, we see this as an easy way for people to assess fluctuations in their ability to limit carbon output. Furthermore, we hope to develop a mobile application, for a more user-friendly experience. In this type of environment, friends and family may be able to keep each other committed to the program, as well.
