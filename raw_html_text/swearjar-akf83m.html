                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in the emergence of iot device and its conjuction with advances in machine learning. We thought of a pretty fun example of how these two work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The swear jar records conversation and every time it hears a swear or curse word it will automatically deduct a dollar from your account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services Speech java sdk to convert speech to text. We then read whenever a swear word was uttered and increased the cost respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had some trouble setting up the Speech API. We also had insufficient time to implement the payment processing side as well. We hope to complete that in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real meat of the application was dealing with the the speech api and ensuring it was accurate. Despite the initial hiccups we were successful in implementing the speech to text functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speech to text is hard. Dealing with Azure's documentation is harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SwearJar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue working on the accuracy of the backend and will soon implement a safe and secure payment model. We soon hope to see a physical device running our application.
