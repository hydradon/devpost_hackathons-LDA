                    Inspiration:
Caught amidst our busy lives, we tend to miss out on several events and yes a smart reminder could just be our savior! 
People tend to mark many events as  &ldquo;Interested&rdquo; on facebook and tend to miss out the most relevant events. We are primarily concerned with delivering precise details related to particular events which may arouse interest in a person. So we thought of making an application, where a person can freely look for events as per his taste. And boom here we are with the Android application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
&bull; Retrieving event details using Facebook events.
&bull; Parse details and store them appropriately.
&bull; When a user searches for events, events are presented to him within a limited radius.
&bull; User has a choice of checking all the events nearby or write relevant keywords for searching events as per his    choice
&bull; Specific events related to keywords are then presented to User.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
Following are the steps:
&bull; The first and most important step was integrating Facebook API for our Android app.
&bull; We then implemented Facebook login connection in our app.
&bull; Then we used Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API to find RSVP events for the user who is logged in.
&bull; The event data(JSON) obtained is parsed to retrieve data.
&bull; The user then enters a keyword to search for a specific set of events. The app analyzes the data and provides the most relevant events to the user based on the keyword.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Smart Event Suggestion app:
&bull; Integrating Machine Learning based API to find similar words related to query words, and then giving more accurate event suggestions. 
&bull; Making GUI of the app more user-friendly.
&bull; Integrating Calendar/Reminder option with the application.
&bull; Share with friends feature.
&bull; Including maps and geoinformation with respect to the event.
&bull; Increasing the radius of events across the US.
&bull; Developing the application for various different platforms like IOS  and hybrid web application.
