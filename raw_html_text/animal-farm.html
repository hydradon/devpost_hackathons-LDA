                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My daughter loves hearing animal noises and guessing what noises each of them make. She also loves every time our Echo interacts with us to involve her (normally to play nursery rhymes). So I wanted to build her a skill that she will enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tells you what noises various animals make, using the new Speechcons where possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java and the Alexa skills kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking of animals and finding the Speechcons Alexa is capable of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing my daughter smile the first time she heard the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That kids don't always want to help make demonstration videos :-D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Animal Farm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will develop into a game where it will ask what animal makes X noise and the child has to name the animal.
                </p>
