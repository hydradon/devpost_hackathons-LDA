                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a site where people can be informed about the Women's Rights Movement, and can let out their emotions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website has info on issues that the Women's Rights Movement fights for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us coded different parts of the website. We went to family site of Anagha and Pavana, and put it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make a discussion page, but the global comments weren't syncing. So to fix that problem, we made a rant page, where people can go to let out their thoughts on the subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely making the carousel, and getting everything done in a clean, clear, and timely manner were the few things that we are most proud of.
