                    Medai works by using neural networks to learn how to recognize human emotions. Every emotion is a biochemical response, which in turn causes an external, physical change in one's facial details. These details are captured in a picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The picture becomes the input for our neural network, trained on a diverse dataset of thousands of images of people expressing emotion, both explicitly and subtly. The network classifies the input image and returns a probability distribution of the subject's current emotional state.
                </p>

                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    The importance of empathy, the awareness of depression, as well as what we can do to improve the state of both human conditions. With the growing importance of mental health, we found it extremely important to develop an application that makes it easier for physicians to diagnose patients who may have mental health disorders.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MedAI uses machine learning to accurately predict mental health disorders using facial analysis.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pretrained-model was imported from Keras and re-trained on a dataset of 4900 photos of a diverse group of individuals featuring the 7 primary emotions. The application then compares an input photo (taken by the user) and uses the trained model to determine a probability distribution of emotions. The App was designed with Android Studio.
