                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem we tried to solve is that people do not understand themselves well enough sometimes. This can manifest in a variety of ways; for example, someone may be angry and not know why they're angry. Behavior and mood can also affect human health and life expectancy; for example, chronic stress is thought to lead to premature death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As college students, we are familiar with how mental unwellness can result in devastating consequences to grades, careers, social lives, and, of course, health. There innumerable stressors in everyone's lives and how we react, or deal with, these stressors often determines how we feel and our future responses to stressors. But not everybody has a chance to be educated about the connection between mental heath, physical health, and success. Even those who are aware of these important links may not always remember the importance of these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project uses physical health data like time spent sleeping, heart rate, and activities performed throughout the day and combines these with a person's mood to generate a suggestion for how to improve your daily wellness!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WebApp was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The FitBit WebAPI was utilized to provide health data and computations were performed using research about the link between physical health and emotional wellbeing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into were configuring the OAuth2.0 system to authorize the WebApp to use the user's health data and figuring out how exactly we wanted to generate a suggestion given data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we learned how to use the FitBit API to gather health data and better human health. We also really like the emoji sliders we made on the project webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the FitBit WebAPI from a technical standpoint. We also learned that the ideation stage of a project is often the most important and takes the most time (it took us more than 24 hours to settle on an idea!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FitQ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand the analysis of health data and find cheaper alternatives to a FitBit Ionic. We really feel that the link between mental and physical wellbeing has not been sufficiently explored using technology to better people's education. A major goal for us is making something like a health tracker available to those in less fortunate circumstances or where the infrastructure is not able to support high technological throughput.
