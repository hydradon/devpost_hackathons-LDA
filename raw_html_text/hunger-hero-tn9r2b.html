                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the growing desire to create more sustainable sources of food, we wanted to fight against food wastage, as over 1/3 of all food produced in the US ends up going to waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows restaraunts and grocery stores to connect with food banks and give them excess foods, based on the needs of the food bank's needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase and react, along with javascript, html, and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having planned functions make it into the final build, such as using computer vision to quickly take inventory of the food bank's stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app to connect food banks with companies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work in a team, especially one where the majority of us are first time hackers.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using computer vision to take inventories quickly, using the google maps api to find nearby food banks and companies, creating an incentivization system for individual users to get involved with the platform, and more!
