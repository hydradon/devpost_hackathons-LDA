                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build an application that allows users to make some transaction on business, on the street and so on, Different from ATH Mobile that don't allows you make transactions on business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It read a Qr Code that have all the information of the receiver and the amount of money you will pay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it starting with ATH Mobile Learning its API then followed through with android, were we found a nice third party app that communicates seemly with our app and reads QR codes. QR codes were chosen because their easily recognizable by devices and is wildly spread among them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with ath movil that made us adapt the code to later discover the sever was down. also some reasearch and process development did not worked accordingly.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pymbill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow the user not justo to scan the Qr Code, but allow the user create a Qr Code with an specific amount of money that it will request to an other user.
