                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a community based on competitive basketball pickup games. Many people have a competitive spirit, so we realized if we introduced more competitiveness to an already competitive game, cool things might happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on game performance (winning team and margin of victory), assigns players a ranking based on an elo algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python/Flask/Jinja, we constructed a main python frame for the ELO ranking algorithm and json retrieving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn new concepts like the Flask framework and how to use the Airtable API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Airtable with our algorithm to update the database in real time
                </p>
