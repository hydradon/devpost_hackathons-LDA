                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had always had difficulties finding useful materials to help us study. So when we made materials ourselves, we wanted a way to share them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform allows for uploading lecture notes as well as organization by school, class, professor, and subject. Although currently you cannot find notes through anything but the notes search tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the great jHipster framework we were able to put this website together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our team members had much programming experience at all, and he didn't know anything about jHipster. It was a massive learning experience for the whole team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website runs, we're amazed by that fact more than anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The great power that strong frameworks like jHipster can give a developer, allowing you to focus on the important design aspects as opposed to technical problems you may encounter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan to continue developing and eventually launch this product.
