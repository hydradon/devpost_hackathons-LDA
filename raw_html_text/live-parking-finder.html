                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This began when I (Adam) was trying to find a parking space at UF, all of the parking spots were taken and I had to drive around the school for roughly 30 minutes. After thinking about this idea more, I realized that if there was a website that knew what spots were open and could route the user to an available spot, it would save time and reduce carbon emissions. When I brought this idea to Hack Harvard, I experienced the same thing while traveling around Boston, so we changed the idea to be focused on parking in Boston.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can open up a website and see a map of Boston showing the users location, the available parking meters shown with a "P", and the taken parking meters shown with a red location pin, and get directions to the available pin they select on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building a website with Google Maps API to show the users location, locations of available and taken meters. Once the user clicks on the location of a parking meter, the route from where the user is to the parking meter. Once this was completed, we shifted our focus to using Google Cloud API in order to use Machine Learning to determine if a parking spot is vacant or occupied. Unfortunately, we were not able to incorporate this in the final version due to the lack of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two main challenges we ran into were lack of time and lack of experience with the Google Cloud API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together to finish the routing from an initial location to the meters using google maps API and we a got google cloud machine learning working in the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us had very limited skills coming into this competition. We all learned about Google Maps API and Google Cloud API when we worked together to solve the problems. We also learned about many other subjects of computer science and technology from the many tech talks we went to.
                </p>

                    What's next for Live Parking Finder - Boston
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adam is planning on taking what started at Hack Harvard back to the University of Florida. He is planning on pitching the idea in order to get permission and funding to set up a similar project for the university.
