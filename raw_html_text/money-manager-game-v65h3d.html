                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a game for people who don't know anything about finances and how to manage their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes you through a pick your own adventure style game, starting in university. You go through and spend money on tuition, then you enter the work force. In the work force, you can use the money you have to trade stocks, and invest your money.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python, we created a word-based text game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was learning how to debug all the code. This was definitely the biggest piece of code that I have written, since I am really new to programming. It was hard to keep on task and stay organized.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the game is now able to run from start to finish without any bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about writing efficient code, and ways to simplify processes.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Manager Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would want to put the Money Manager Game on a GUI. It would create a more visually appealing interface, and be more user friendly.
