                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen, we had no idea where we were going. We vowed never to get lost again! And thus this hack was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This map allows you to explore Michigan State University (south neighborhood)! Expand your horizons! Travel to the campus you've always wanted to see!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Computers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...And Unity3D, C#, xpadder, and sketchup. We used sketchup to create the layout of Michigan State and imported that to Unity to walk around the campus and figure out the layout!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our challenges were figuring out the code that would allow our character to move freely around the campus and the controls for sketchup to create the campus.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making the campus as precise as possible and solving the problems we had. Also being able to stay up the whole time, but mostly the other one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of team work and were exposed to C#. We also learned modeling techniques, as well as the basics of unity logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MSU Virtual Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step to improving MSU Virtual Map is to create the rest of Michigan State's campus and have more information relating to the whole campus. We could also make it easy to pick your major and highlight the main buildings that will help you familiarize yourself with your new home! As an added bonus, we could create characters who interact with you to tell you fun facts about the campus!
