                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Have you ever read an article with multiple obscure references that leads you to jump from one Wikipedia article to another?
                    </strong>
                    Glome is a chrome extension that saves you time by telling you everything you need to know about a word, name, or phrase! Imagine everything you need to know about any term - including definitions, summary, locations, history, and much more - available at the click of a button. Whether it is news articles, post, forums, or Wikipedia pages, we promise that Glome will revolutionize the way you interact with information in your browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S: Glome was named after a 4D sphere, because when you combine it with what you are reading you have 4 dimensions of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After you install it, all you need to do is highlight a word and click the Glome icon at the top of your Chrome browser. We will provide you with all the useful information you might need from Google, Wikipedia, and WolframAlpha. Our response is concise but thorough. Even we have learned a lot in the process of testing it. Now it's your turn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Glome is built as a chrome extension in HTML and Javascript. It sends http request to a server which is maintained by a Node.JS module with Express.JS and the WolframAlpha npm plugin. It uses smart scraping algorythms to provide you with the highest quality of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement more APIs into the project but we ran short on time :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works even better than anyone on the team could have imagined. Additionally, it combines three sources of information that are bound to cover anything you throw at it - including
                    <strong>
                        mathematical calculations
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make chrome extensions - which can be surprisingly difficult. But it was a very useful and rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glome
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to release it on the Chrome Store! So look out for it in the following weeks. We want to see how large of an impact it can have, and how it changes the way you browse the web.
