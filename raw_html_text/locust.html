                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine being connected to those around you at any time. If you were studying in the library, you could immediately find out about a fundraiser downstairs; if you were resting in your dorm, you could hear about an event with free food in seconds. All without making a chat or adding members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You send messages with Locust. Each message is permanently pinned to the map at the location where you sent it. Locust reinvents our idea of a group chat; instead of creating chats based on your social connections, Locust gives you access to a single chat at all times, based on your physical location. Over time, Locust builds a history of messages across the landscape.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xcode with Swift and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never developed a mobile app before. Learning Xcode was difficult, and as was determining how to test Locust.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I took on a completely unfamiliar project. I could have quit, but I stuck with it and completed a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned lots about Swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for Locust
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I considered pinning messages to landmarks on the map instead of individual locations. This would allow distinct chats for restaurants, parks,
