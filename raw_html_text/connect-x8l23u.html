                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you&rsquo;re meeting someone for the first time. You&rsquo;d like to add them on your facebook,on your instagram, maybe even on your snapchat. Isn&rsquo;t it hugely inconvenient to open up each social media app and take down someone&rsquo;s username for each social app?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect is a web app that does the same for you in a simple click. Using google tone, our web app generates a sound to transfer a url from one person to another.This url is unique and includes all the usernames of all social apps the user may be on. So, with a simple click, you can transfer or receive a multitude of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our user interface using HTML and CSS. We use PHP to generate links for each social media app, depending on the username input, and created a unique url and webpage for each user. We used simple text files to store our data, which included a username, password, and social media usernames.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially used Django, SQLite and Python to store and encrypt the data, and generate urls. We also tried to use JavaScript to receive the data from the back end. However, communicating between front end and back end proved to be a challenge as Django isn't very well documented. We then switched to PHP which was relatively easier. However, communicating between action forms on front end and data bases accessed by PHP wasn't easy as we couldn't call our PHP functions directly onto our form input boxes. Instead, we called a url which called a PHP function and returned its value.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had dealt with back end before. Some of us were doing web development for the first time. We're proud of successfully generating and storing the data we needed to, despite the steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of team work and cooperation. Since we were in a team of four and didn't clearly define our roles at the beginning, we ended up overlapping some of our work. This is when we organised ourselves, and allocated roles to members, according to the member's proficiency or experience or simple enthusiasm to learn a new language. 
We also learned the power of simplicity. The complicated process of communicating data between front-end and back-end that we initially tried didn't improve our functionality much, compared to the relatively easier but effective way we ended up using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to expand this by making it into an android app. In addition to generating a sound to transmit the url, we would also like to use Near Field Communication. With this addition, the app can transmit the url if the user just taps his or her phone to the other&rsquo;s. 
Also, as our users grow in number and our data base becomes larger, we would also like to move the data base from simple text files to perhaps MySQL, and use PHP to directly access values from it. We would also like to add functions, such as sending github portfolios, sending information such as work experience or skills, and generating a e-business card that could be transmitted to potential employers using NFC or Google Tone. This would help save paper, as we are essentially transmitting information that a resume and/or a business card would include.
