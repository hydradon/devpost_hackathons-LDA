                    "New York City has no landfills or incinerators, yet residents produce 12,000 tons of waste every day. What happens when you throw something away?". We would want people to answer "give it to ReViVe" because as people say "one man's trash is another man's treasure". In a more serious note, we are well aware of the problems garbage collection is creating, not only in the environment but also in politics. Recently China declared they did not want to take our garbage anymore, so now where is it going to go? We would like recyclabe garbage to go to centers where they can be reused. Our app name is literally what we want to do for the Earth, help us

                    </b>
                    that specifically accept the item users take pictures of. First, we take a picture that is sent to Google Vision API to recognize what it is. From there we show the user the results within the app and request any adjustments to be made. Users are able to take pictures of multiple items (different types possible) and are automatically saved in a list of

                        ready to recycle

                        map out the nearest recycle centers
                    </b>
                    that accept your items. These locations are found using external API's, including Earth911 and NYC Open Data The information can be filtered (display only category X, display all). Depending to the dataset used for a specific item, the app will provide detailed information about the recycling center, such as
                    <i>
                        name, address, number, email, categories accepted.
                    </i>
                    Lastly, it will be up to you to

                    First of all we were all able to learn

                        React Native
                    </b>

                        Google Vision API

                    , and other APIs. But we also learn about teamwork, each one of us is from a different CUNY school and yet somehow we were able to work together for 2 days along with other teams, everyone helping each other out, so what we truly learned is that working together great things can be achieved!
