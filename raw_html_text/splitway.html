                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we want to go somewhere, we always try to get our friends to come along to split the cost of an Uber or other ride sharing service with us. Sharing a ride sharing service with someone else normally halves the cost and makes it much cheaper to travel within the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SplitWay allows people to find others that are going from around the same area as them to the same event or destination. It was intended for primarily for college students who are all on campus together and many of whom will want to go to similar places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built SplitWay using FLASK framework with a python back-end and a bootstrap front-end. We utilized SQLalchemy to store events and our users. We used Google Maps API to help see if people were close enough together to be "matched".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we came in, no one on our team had any experience with web frameworks such as FLASK, which we ended up using. We also had a wide array of backgrounds, so it proved difficult to create a project in a way that combined all of our skills. That is part of the reason that we used FLASK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to utilize a framework that no one had any experience with to make a full web application. We are also proud of the amount that we learned in general. No one had any experience with SQLalchemy, half of our team didn't know python, and half of our team didn't know HTML or CSS well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology wise, our team learned a lot about SQLAlchemy, FLASK, and general python, HTML, and CSS. Our biggest takeaways though was learning how to use git to work as a team (through many errors of pushing and merging incorrectly) and how to approach projects like this in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SplitWay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make SplitWay more like a true "matching" service by utilizing existing social media accounts. Instead of just showing people everyone within a range of miles that want to leave at a similar time, we would like to pair the users together. With that, we would like to implement a notification service that works to tell people when others have been found for their event automatically. 
We would also like to implement other services native through SplitWay with ways to split the cost of a ride share or order a ride share service.
                </p>
