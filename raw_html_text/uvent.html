                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest truisms in the entrepreneurship space is that no one wants an events app - and we concur. People prefer asking their friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        &ldquo;Hey, Tim! What are you doing tonight?&rdquo;
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    But if you&rsquo;re a CS/EECS/CE kid without friends, you can ask the next best thing - Alexa from the 5th Echo Dot you&rsquo;ve won at a hackathon! With that we present Uvent, the premier Alexa skill for discovering events around you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        &ldquo;Hey Alexa! Ask Uvent what&rsquo;s going on this weekend?&rdquo;
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Finally, you can get some use out of your Echo Dots!

                </h4>
                <p>
                    We also built a web interface (you can also use it on mobile) for users to submit events they know about as well as scroll through our database of events.

                <p>
                    We want everyone to experiment with event data, so we've exposed our APIs for anyone to play around with. We've done the hard work of cleaning up the data - you just have to come up with a cool idea!

                    <li>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With any date/time based project, there's a lot of converting between different formats, time zones, etc... which quickly gets frustrating. That took some time to get hashed out, but eventually we got it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CORS also gave us some trouble with sending POST requests to our API. We were able to add a Access-Control-Allow-Origin fix that allowed us to send the requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal with this project was to use as much of AWS as possible, and I think we&rsquo;ve definitely learned a ton. Reading and learning about AWS or any tech isn&rsquo;t the same as actually using it in a project, so this really opened up our eyes in terms of how to configure our services and what the applications of each are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Uvent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re initially launching Uvent for events near the University of Maryland, College Park. Because of our familiarity with event datasets in our area, that's what we're starting out with. In the future, we plan to expand nationwide, covering as many college campuses as possible (and even further after that)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, we want Uvent to tailor events based on every user's interests. As the user uses the skill more, they will receive more events that are filtered for their preferences. When someone asks Alexa for event suggestions, it will list out the events that are most relevant.
                </p>
