                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to inform the users where to dispose or recycle an item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user takes a picture with your phone of an item and it will show you the nearest location where you can recycle or dispose of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native and expo to build the item scanner.
We then used the Google Cloud Vision to identify the scanned items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced lots of server-side challenges as we were new to react native and node js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use Google's machine learning API to show what an object is based on the pictures taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new technologies and how to use APIs along with React Native and node js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recycle Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to fully automate this and polish the app.
