                        We imported character models, modified their abilities and the sort in terms of gameplay, and we physically changed them, for the better.

                        Each Character has around 1700 separate frames/sprites, and we only were able to do 300 for one character.

                        The platforms were completely foreign to me since I found out about them maybe a week before the hackathon, and this was my first attempt at modifying and making my own game with it.

                        We should start from scratch and use 3D Models, so this time we don't have to have sprites for each frame. In addition, we should use Unity or other gaming platforms to create our game, since we'll have more freedom to code with.
