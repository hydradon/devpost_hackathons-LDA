                    The problem which we wanted to endeavor was digitalization of health in Philippine. We made an application, which not only uses the original communication method called SPASMS, but also takes it a step further to bring a full digitalization of health in Philippine. Think of an Uber app -- just as Uber connects the customer and driver to communicate directly, our application connects the doctor and patient to communicate at all times so that the patient can always be aware of his/her medical needs if the doctor owns a smartphone. SMS will be sent through our application and we believe that this function would work favorably for the less privileged communities. 
 Initially, the client will have to register, where the client will input their phone number, password, and the choice of a patient or a doctor, which will determine which service they receive. After, both the doctor and patient can log in by typing in their phone number and password. One of the key point of this application is it's potential to be distributed and used more widely. We used Amazon Webservice to construct our database system, which is expected to be applied in data mining or big data or many other purposes, depending on how the developer wants to use it. Also, the interface of this application offers a user friendly experience so that any patients or doctors would be fond of using our application.
                    <br>
                    Unforunately, the lack of time has limited us from developing many distinguished features of the two roles, but we have set the foundations for other developers to optimize the doctor's and the patient's experience with the app.
