                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual assistances like Cortana and Siri are not web based but operating system based, limiting to their access on different devices and platforms such as Linux, Windows and OS X.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySecretary is a web based application in which any device or platform is able to access with internet connection. This application can recognize your speech and change it to text for purposes such as taking notes, sending an e-mail, add events to calendar, and much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Concordia University's school server to host our web application, the Nuance's API, HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges were the Nuance API not functioning with Chrome and hence used Firefox to overcome the firewall from the university's server; the button to activate and recognize the voice recognition. We received no response from Amazon Web Hosting to host our domain onto their server; and also not enough time to incorporate SAP and Nuance into the same application and Nuance limiting our resources to build our program such as grammar, get all the information in one recording. Lastly, we were unable to upload a contact list and having to learn android but not using it as the end result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nuance API successfully working with the Firefox browser. 
Using the Concordia University's server to host our web application when other web hosting sites failed us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the Nuance API, websocket API, Ionic framework and android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Secretary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop a login page for the user to link to their personal accounts such as Google account. With this, the user is then able to send e-mails, sync their events into their calendar and much more.
