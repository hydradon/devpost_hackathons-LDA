                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My bigger projects were tiring me out and I just wanted to work on a short games to refresh my self.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game! A 2d physics game where you control the trajectory the Swan will fly in. Each orbs replenishes the bird, allowing for another jump.The goal is the reach the top of the screen.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this in GM Studio from scratch. Did all the art work my self in Aseprite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make mechanics engaging. I almost gave up working on this game because I couldn't figure out what aesthetic I wanted to approach the game with and what mechanincs would work best with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also tried adding a trajectory feature which generated a list of coordinates marking a graph of the players potential trajectory. As we speak this is a work progress!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collisions were a persistent problem, as well as weird ticks with the way the engine exports to html5.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to recollect my self and approach the project from a different angle. 
Developing a better understanding of data structures within the Engine.
Understanding how to the engine translates to java.

                    I'll possibly polish it up and turn it into an Android/iOs app.
