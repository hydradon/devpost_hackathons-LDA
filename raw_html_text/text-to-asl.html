                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    6-8 million people in the U.S. have a speech or hearing disability and we wanted to helped them by creating a new approach to communication using global technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs text into the text box and the app changes the text to a series of gifs that shows the translation of the text in ASL. These gifs are then displayed on the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and taking advantage of the mentorship program at PennApps, we built the app using Java for the user experience and XML for the user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android does not natively support animated gifs, so we had to create out own class that extended the View class to allow these gifs to be animated. Also, at the last minute one of our team members fell ill and was unable to attend the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members had previous experience in Android App Development, so learning the SDK and over basic layout of Android was a challenge for the team to overcome. In the end we were able to come up with a finished product that is functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Android Studio, Android SDK, XML, and integrating animated gifs in Android apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextyASL
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add voice recognition so a user can speak into the app and it is translated into ASL. We would also like to make it so it could convert ASL to text.
