                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to make an app that could help people with the day to day issue of making food and what recipes to follow and make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was intended to scan a receipt or barcode and store the data of the returned product in a personal fridge for the user in the cloud. That way when the user uses the app to find recipes our app knows what the user has in his/her fridge and can suggest recipes only based on what he/she has to work with. No more getting half way through a recipe before realising you don't have a crucial ingredient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were only able to get as far as producing a barcode scanner.
