                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide a way for friends to bet and wager with each other informally but on a virtual platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web-application using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL which uses Bootstrap's responsive interface to match the screen size of any device. It works by creating an account and making a bet, where you define the parameters for the bet; i.e. real or fake currency and what the betting statement is. The bet information will be stored in the MySQL database and will by importing into a table which the user can see. The aim is for friends to be invited and bet against each other, where the bet creater acts as a referee and decides the winner(s).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was of 4 people, 2 front-end and 2 back-end. However, as of Saturday our team only consisted of 2 people - the front-end developers. This means we have all the pages of the site designed, with working popups and features. However, we have the functionality lacking in the website, due to the lack of back-end developers during this process. 
This is probably the biggest challenge myself and my colleague faced, as we had to take upon a greater role of writing MySQL code, which was foreign to both of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud to produce something we visualised in our minds, to make the website look the way we want without compromise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I should know back-end technologies as much as I do front-end, so I do not have to rely on other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CronyBet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to finish and implement the features we had planned, which include a link to facebook and a real currency (using brain-tree)
