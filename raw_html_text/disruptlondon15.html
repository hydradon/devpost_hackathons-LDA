                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've found tremendous value in the application of realtime text-based messages. We realised that we could apply this thinking to solve real problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is centered around a map showing realtime text-based broadcasts and app enables you to tune into streams of text. If the broadcaster is in an emergency situation, they can ask for and accept help from the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How did we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Node.js, Angular.js, Twilio, Esri and a whole heap of tech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Tell us a story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From beloved blogging tools like Medium, to terrific tools like Twitter - we love using words to tell each other stories. But in the era of now-ness, what could we use to tell each other what happened, while it happens, while we're typing - immediately?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've crafted a text-based broadcast app that's particularly good at handling emergency situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video is great and images are too, but all too often it's just not the right medium. If you're sitting at your desk, avidly following a game of rugby, it probably wouldn't be wise to have the sound on. Text is the way to go here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're a journalist reporting important pieces of information as soon as you hear them, text is a fast and powerful way to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd love to tell you how it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've got two phones here, one broadcaster and one user. If you use a little bit of imagination you'll know that A the broadcaster is texting from a game of football in the Olympic stadium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our user B is sitting here in the audience watching presentations, so he can't really have any sound while he follows the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly and without warning, just as in Paris a few ago - chaos and panic ripple through the bones of every single person sitting in the stadium. This is a terror attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A flips the switch and enters emergency mode - everyone following the broadcast can see there is a problem and A can explain exactly what's happening and what he needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A switches to dictation through Twilio using text-to-speech from his iPhone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    B has noticed that his app now has a 'help' button visible. He's nearby and wants to do as much as he possibly can to help, so he looks at the options of food, donation, physical help and shelter - he clicks shelter and offers his flat as a safe-haven for the next few hours and a place for charging phones. It's less than 5 minutes away and he knows the tube is going to be a terrifying nightmare for the foreseeable future. Company and quiet safety is a priceless commodity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A immediately gets a notification from B with a warm offer of help. Using Twilio, the two of them can connect safely without having to exchange their personal data.
                </p>
