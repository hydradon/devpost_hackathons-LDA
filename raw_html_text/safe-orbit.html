                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After watching the Martian, I wondered how we could better secure space vehicles to prevent space piracy. In the case of Mark Watney, a security measure such as this would have meant his death, however, the evolution of space travel will mean that human nature will seep into space travel and eventually a real, nefarious space jacking will take place. In order to proactively reduce the chances of this happening, Safe Orbit was developed.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safe Orbit creates an easy to use security measure for boarding spacecraft in order to prevent space piracy. Ever since Mark Watney became the first space pirate, the very real threat of space piracy exists and needs to be addressed before millions of dollars of spaceflight hardware is stolen.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the OpenCV library with Python for the facial recognition component and displayed the contents on a Tkinter window.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial recognition with OpenCV was difficult to install. Gathering all the proper dependencies and using the right version of python made using OpenCV difficult to begin with. Next was figuring out how to activate the web camera and have OpenCV recognize when a face was on camera. Thats where the cascade comes in to match the features of a human face.

                <p>
                    I am proud to have developed software that can recognize a human face.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is relatively easy to rapidly develop software to find human faces using python and OpenCV
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safe Orbit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is training OpenCV to match facial features to recognize specific faces so that the fidelity of the security system is higher. A database of faces is necessary to accomplish this task.
