                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It originally started when we were talking about this recent invention in which developers put sensors in fruits and as people moved their hands in the air above the fruit the program would play a pitch that changed with the movement of the person. From there, we were trying to think of ideas for what to make and after spending some time at the hardware table the idea suddenly popped into our minds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an LED ring that displays a random pattern of colors. Players are given three pictures of fruit and with each round must show the fruit with the correct color to match the pattern. If the player gets a pattern wrong they lose, and are only able to successfully complete the game if they make it through ten rounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Arduino IDE to develop our game, creating multiple files within the folder that all communicate and share data with each other. None of us had ever created using Arduino so we went to the workshop last night and learned everything we used from there and from what we could find in open source materials. Aside from the programming aspect, much of the hardware (like the color sensor, or the LED ring) we had never used before, so we had to learn how to solder the pieces together, and connect them all to the board.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we had all planned to not present our project at the end of the Hackathon, but after how much we had accomplished and how proud we were considering we learned everything in one night, we decided we stay and show others what we had made.
