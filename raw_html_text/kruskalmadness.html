                    There comes a day when every young computer science major must face great challenges, and rise to the occasion of their newfound responsibility.  But few ever suspect that the day could come so soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine.  You are a fresh computer science undergraduate, full of hope, and with a bright future ahead of you.  You sign up for this exciting class, CMSC 351, algorithms with Kruskal.  The man, the myth, the legend.  Kruskal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Class goes well, but one day, you get a homework assignment back.  A "0" is scrawled across the top.  You realize that you are out of your depth.  What's left to do?  A hole opens in the bottom of your stomach as you realize - you need the wisdom of the master himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You walk gingerly up the third floor of A.V. Williams.  Halfway down the hallway, the foreboding door looms ahead of you.  Nearly twice as tall as you, it swings open ominously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ahead of you lies what can only be described as a war zone.  Papers and old bottles of sodas liter the ground.  And in the middle of it all, the lone survivor, Kruskal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He beacons you over, waiting as if to give you an important message.  With great trepidation, you begin your trek across the hallowed ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    May god have mercy on your soul.
