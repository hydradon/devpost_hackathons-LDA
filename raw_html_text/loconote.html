                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To talk about what inspired is to first tell a story of what we realized Friday night. As our group became exhausted trying to think of hackathon projects, we decided a walk on the beach would be beneficial to our minds. As we were treading along, we reminisced about the fun times that we already had here. We just wished we could be able to mark this specific spot down forever as a joyful memory. We all instantly thought this was a great idea for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to connect to a global map. You will be able to add pins to the map at your current position. When you add this pin, you can pick an emotion and write a short caption to go along with it. With the app, you can see all the pins you and everyone else has added. They will appear as emojis that you can click on to see the caption. Our app also has the feature of notifying when you are in a location with a LocoNote. To prevent your map from being cluttered by pins, we decided only let you see pins that are nearby(within 20 meters).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was built using Android Studio IDE. However, we first designed a rough wire-frame of our app using Figma. We then split into teams developing UI, back-end, and other specific features. For the back-end of our project, we used Google Cloud Platform specifically Firebase's Realtime Databases. Additonally we also integrated Google Maps API and many of its features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github was a huge challenge for us. However, we went to a super informative workshop where they guided us through our specific problems and taught as everything we needed to know about it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that as first-time hackers we were able to come out with a real project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Github and Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LocoNote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to implement personal user accounts so you share LocoNotes privately as well.  We also hope to make the UI better and possibly integrate Snapchat accounts and emojis.
