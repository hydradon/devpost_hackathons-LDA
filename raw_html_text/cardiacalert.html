                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give people a way to communicate with bystanders and get the help they need when they suffer a cardiac arrest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people at risk of heart-attack to be able to store their contact information into a QR code. Once the QR code is scanned, then a set of locations are returned to allow the user to find the nearest AED's around their location.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We built it using Python, Flask and Javascript
