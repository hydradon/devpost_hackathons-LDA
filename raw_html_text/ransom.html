                    Technology exists to streamline our lives, in every aspect. Humanity has taken a crack at almost everything. So why haven&rsquo;t we optimized theft? As careful as we act, or as many crime prevention initiatives we implement, theft will still occur, and it will always occur. At Ransom, our goal is to make the best of a bad situation. An astonishing 96.7% of thefts realize some level of inefficiency. In general, stolen items are more valuable to the owner than the thief. Additionally, items of high utility to the victim are often taken unintentionally because they are bundled with items of high monetary value thieves pursue. Ransom provides a simple, secure platform for thieves (discoverers) and victims (seekers) to mutually benefit. Seekers reunite with their 'low-value' items of high personal utility by compensating discoverers, who in turn profit from these items that would normally end up in a trash bin. It&rsquo;s a classic win-win.
