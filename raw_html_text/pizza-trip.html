                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game where physics are determined by other arbitrary values.

                <p>
                    A simple 2d platform race game for 2 players

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    libgdx, java and Box2d

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Projectiles physiscs, and camera controls were all challenging

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of hard work was put into the game by the whole team and we all had fun doing it. We came in not knowing anything about libgdx but now we are much more seasoned and used to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about game engines and game dev in general(My first game) I also had afun time trying to code as a team. Overall I learned a ton and had a lot of fun.

                    What's next for Pizza Trip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe a full rebuild implimenting better physics art and overall design, mixed with a better combat system and online multiplayer support. E3 2016 here we come.
