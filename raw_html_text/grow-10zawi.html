                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whilst discussing what to build for this hackathon under the problem statement Fintech for Good, we realized something of immense importance. It became clear to our entire team that we are incredibly privileged to be able to do what we are passionate about. However, this opportunity isn't available to everyone around us. We're evolving into a society that values education and knowledge more than anything else, making it more difficult for the lower income households to survive. This situation is what inspired us.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grow is a monthly subscription service where its users decide how much money they want the service to charge. After selecting a price they are comfortable with, they can browse through a list of people who want to gain an education, but lack the financial resources to do so and choose who they want their money to go to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native on the front end. Firebase to handle authentication and storing users and Node/Express on the backend.

                    Translating the design into code. Figuring out user flows and stories.
