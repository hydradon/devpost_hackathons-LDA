                    We are beginners who have almost never touched front-end and web stuff. We are proud of what we've got and the effort we've put into it.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we are not able to finish it within the given time, we will work on it as our future project. Our vision is to combine student information with course information, so we can see who else are taking this course and what are those people's emails. We plan to extract information from the TigerBook API. Trust us. The missing thing here is just the front-end stuff.
