                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday we go through life

                <p>
                    This application generates playlists for the user based on realtime weather forecast data and the impact that has on moods as well as the user's past listening history through utilization and creation of algorithms.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Ruby on Rails to create our project and built everything around it. We pulled from AccuWeather's APIs including MinuteCast and the 24Hour Hourly Forecast. We also pulled from Spotify's Authentication, Tracks, and Playlists. We also utilized various smaller APIs for features such as IP location etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned Ruby which is a language that none of us had any experience with. We also faced challenges with creating a valid and acceptable process in which to go about this within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have something to show off at the end of this Hackathon. We are proud of the growth we underwent throughout the sleep deprivation and red bull fueled yelling matches with our computers. We are proud to have come up with an idea and know what tools and methods we need to implement in order to make something that has massive potential and can be widely used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned essential skills in Ruby and web development. We also refined our abilities to make algorithms to decipher needed scenarios through utilizing metrics and coming up with our own through reading research papers and studies.
                </p>

                    What's next for Lluvia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lluvia is just getting started. We did not have a chance to implement all of our ideas to the best of our ability but we are looking to in the future. In order to do this we want to ask permission to extend API keys and possibly purchase if necessary. We have the potential to add more playlist personalization and improving the algorithm we use for this. We would also like to improve the user experience by implementing more and better visual content and interaction.
