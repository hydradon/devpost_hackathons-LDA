                    <strong>
                        Just a realistic simulation of the beauty of ENED.
                    </strong>
                    This project was a rollercoaster of sorrow and laughter. In short, our plan was to design a pointless game that would allow anyone to experience the horrors (and numerous inside jokes) associated with the introductory engineering courses at UC. Thus, ENED Simulator was born.

                    In order to get this whole thing running, our team had to learn SFML (a third party library) to utilize C++ code in a GUI. This process was incredibly challenging, but also very rewarding. We also implemented the numerous header files associated with VCPKG, a third party that allowed us to work with SFML in Visual Studio.

                    After much deliberation discussing how exactly we wanted the game to run, we spent the better part of 15 hours creating the greatest game known to mankind. Hope you enjoy!
