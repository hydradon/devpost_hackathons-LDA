                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The Authors on our team created a multi-arc choose your own adventure story. A C program was developed as part of the same project to generate template files for the authors to fill. A second C program was developed to facilitate progression through the adventure story by parsing the files and reacting based off of character queues and user responses. The C program is hosted on a Google Cloud Platform Debian Linux VM and is interacted with via an SSH terminal connection. The SSH terminal connection is interacted with via a web terminal embedded in an iFrame in a custom made HTML website. This website is hosted by Domains.com.
