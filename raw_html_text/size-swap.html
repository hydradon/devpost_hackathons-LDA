                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a late night. The latest yeezy's were about to drop. My army of bots were ready. I was gonna get those yeezy's. However, tragedy struck. All the 9s were taken in a blink of a second. My loyal bots, struggled on and got me a size 12.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was heart broken. After hours of prep, I would only end up with the wrong shoe size. This is when inspiration struck for 
Size Swap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Size Swap is a revolutionary shoe trading platform. I can trade my size 12 yeezy's for someone else's size 9.Now we both burned by low supply, high demand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our bare hands we typed fiercely until they bleed. We combined Angular and Firebase to bring alive a modern, sleek, lightweight shoe trading platform. On the back-end we use'd a pinch nodejs to handle the processing of orders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges along our journey to building this great platform. We struggled to build a database schema that scaled as we added new, high value features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, Firebase db is a no-sql database allowing us the flexibility to change the schema to meet our needs as challenges arose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another surprising challenge we faced was sending an email to users upon finding a match to trade shoes. However, after some time scouring the web we solved the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last major challenge we faced was creating the orders page. We wanted the page to dynamically display only the products that the user had swaps for would display. Unfortunately, the way we structured our database and angular project, prohibited us from finding a good solution in a timely manner.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we built an end-to-end proof of concept in 36 hours. We also accomplished building a clean website that integrates seamlessly with our nodejs back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with angular. Only one us was familiar with the technology. We also learned a lot about working with a service such as Firebase and some of the benefits of a no-sql database. The project taught us a lot about the importance of better fleshing out a basic infrastructure to help scale the project as it grows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Size Swap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to take the issues we learned from the hackathon and problems we saw in our infrastructure and code pipeline to better flesh out our design. This will help us build a better, leaner and more robust app as we take an actual build of the service to market.
