                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People get angry. When people get angry, they tend to say things they don&rsquo;t mean to say. According to the Mental Health Organization, &ldquo;32% of people say they have a close friend or relative that has trouble controlling their anger.&rdquo; This can lead to broken friendships and workplace harassment, among other things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sought to create a filter that could serve as a secondary moral conscience for times when anger may have got the best of you.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    FBLint is a Chrome Extension for Facebook messages that analyzes your conversations in real-time and alerts you if you are about to send an inappropriate or offensive message. Simply put, FBLint could save your relationship, career, or image.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to build a Chrome Extension that monitors what the user is entering in any chat view. Using the Microsoft Cognitive Services and Dandelion APIs, we perform sentiment analysis on the text a user has inputted. This gives us two scores (one from each service) that tells us how positive or negative the piece of text is. We finally weight these scores and combine them into a single metric which we use to classify the text as inappropriate or not, sending an alert to the user if so. We do all this in a performant way, minimizing the delay to retain the natural conversational flow of Facebook while providing accurate flagging of inappropriate messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bulk of the work involved using sentiment analysis to decide whether a piece of text needed to be flagged or not. This involved lots of testing with different sentiment analysis APIs to find one that accurately flagged text as inappropriate while not over-aggressively do so. After testing multiple such APIs, we decided to integrate both the Microsoft Cognitive Services API and the Dandelion API into our Chrome Extension. We chose to do this because we found that Microsoft&rsquo;s API was quite accurate with structured pieces of language, while Dandelion&rsquo;s sentiment analysis was geared to analyze shorter conversational pieces of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to decide how to combine the values returned by the Microsoft Sentiment Analysis API and the Dandelion API. The Microsoft API returned scores from 0 to 1, whereas the Dandelion API returned scores from -1 to 1, where in both cases, a lower number indicated a more negative sentiment. We needed to test the accuracy of each service on conversational text and find a meaningful way of aggregating the results into a single metric we could use to determine whether to flag text or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, we ran many positive, neutral, and negative conversational phrases through the APIs and visualized the values returned by each API. We then performed statistical analysis to find the best way to combine these results into a single value that accurately decides when to flag text.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we achieved what we set out to do! We created a filter for Facebook that could reduce verbal abuse and harassment, which are currently major issues with social media. We are also proud that we were able to integrate our idea seamlessly with Facebook, providing the protection we seeked to offer without disrupting the Facebook user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about sentiment analysis and how it can be used to classify a piece of text as positive or negative. We also learned how to effectively use a statistical approach to create our own accurate metric for evaluating data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FBLint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we could train and incorporate a model on top of Microsoft&rsquo;s API that focuses on sentiment analysis for conversational text, specifically for things like slang. Also, we could extend FBLint to other platforms, such as Slack, to stop workplace harassment. Applying this extension to the work setting would warn employees BEFORE possible misconduct, clearly classify what is inappropriate, and help HR automatically detect verbal abuse.
