                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.JS with Koa2 and Handlebars. PDFs are rendered client side using Mozilla's PDF.js. Communication between server and clients is done using socket.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had trouble with the drag and drop functionality, but managed to overcome it.
Settling on a UI that would be optimal was also a challenge, but we were able to settle on a design with feedback from other participants.
Half of the team members had minimal experience in javascript and almost everyone in the team picked up NodeJS within this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used this hackathon as an opportunity to implement things we have not tried before. (Koa, socket.io, PDF.js)
We are proud to have finished the app within the 24 hours allocated and we strongly believe that our app can be helpful for students' learning, this solution can extend to allow companies to utilize this proof of concept at work. (i.e synchronized presentation
slides.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great learning experience in software engineering for all of us.
We learnt that good planning from the start and well allocation and delegation of work load will help us finish the app on time.
