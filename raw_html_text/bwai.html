                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Years of playing Starcraft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays as an AI in a Brood War Starcraft game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the BWAPI to create my brood war AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a smart AI that can adapt to its situation and make good decisions is very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the code works well, there is a decent win rate against a cpu opponent and it will also probably beat an unaware human player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI's are act

                <h2>
                    What's next for BWAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I aim to make BWAI a fully functional AI that can not only perfectly cheese, but integrate machine learning and other features to make it a challenging opponent to both humans and computers.
