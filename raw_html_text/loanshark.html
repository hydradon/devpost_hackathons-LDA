                    Inspiration - we wanted to create a website/app that will help people be smart with their money!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - links with your bank statements and gives you financial advice. It looks at nearby stores that are cheaper and compares them to where you have been shopping, can help you stay under your monthly budget.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - we used html (TextEdit) and Java (Eclipse) to program, and used Google App Engine as our server.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - adding the Java file to the SSH was like reading a different language to us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - we made a fully functioning Graphical User Interface, an interactive website, and a money snake game for kids to learn to save their money too!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - we learned to ask for help if we need it, and that we can do anything as long as we work hard together.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LoanShark - hopefully we can get on Shark Tank (lol). But really, hopefully in the future LoanShark will be up and running for the public to use!
