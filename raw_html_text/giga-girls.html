                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how Pearl Hacks was founded and how it helped us find friends who motivate us to do well. 
Also, as environmentalists we also wanted to be able to post recyclable tech items that can be sold - the money raised will be provided to fund girls education.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Marvel and Android Studio. The actual prototype is a working one with all the functionality and features in it. The android application is built on Android studio so the application be accessed via phones.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges was how we could portray the algorithm that runs at the background.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how the application looks like and functions. It explains the basic concepts clearly - and also it encompasses a lot of other components that Pearl Hacks is concerned about and based on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how having a community actually plays a huge role in being successful in one's career. I also realized that having to recycle tech items is quite a process and finding the right person who needs it might help other girls who are in need of that money that can fund their education.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Giga Girls
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giga Girls are very curious about how to empower and bring in more women into STEM - aiming at high schoolers and middle schoolers in specific might help us achieve this more efficiently since we have them interested early in their school life.
