                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Pokemon Go at first, and starting brainstorming from there. We first thought about using robot pictures and travelling to collect codes. However, we didn't like moving around, and robots were boring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we built a tool for scavenger hunts, large or small, that can be easily created using a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a site that can be used to generate kittens. These kittens each have a code, which can then be entered by anyone into the website so that they can collect the kitten!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the project into the server and the client. We made the server in python and flask, and the client using HTML and CSS and some javascript (plus a little bootstrap).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Registering a domain name - Domain.com has a few problems and bugs and so as of now, we don't actually have the domain despite having registered it 15 hours ago. Yay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Cloud Platform - Google Cloud Platform is quite neat. There's lots of things you can do. However, it's confusing to learn and very difficult to use with SQL.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lack of experience with web stuff - Not having done much work with websites before made developing one a little tricky. LocalStorage API, Fetch API, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKS! And it looks pretty neat as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        General web stuff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The localStorage API!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Cloud Platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Registering domain names is not fun. At all.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Lol. There are a lot of kittens to collect. Roughly 2 billion. That's enough for now.
