                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the weekends, a lot of CMU students want to go out and have fun, but often times, cannot find people to go with. It is difficult to leave your friends and meet new people, making it hard to find new people and experience new things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing UDown. We filter local events based on your common interests, helping connect you to new people and experiences. A user simply sets up an account and can instantly find and sign up for nearby events that pertain to his or her interests and likes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first decided how to layout the database so that each user, event, and interest are link together through primary keys. Then, half of us attempted to get a server up and running, while the other half designed the client side. Once we got the server running and connected to the database, we were able to write the servlets to modify and retrieve data from the database. Finally, we finished the front end and integrated it with the server-side code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we tried to put our server on heroku, maven would not let us access our servlet code, or the database. After discussing our options, we decided to move our code to a new server, proactively saving ourselves time and energy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After many hours of anguish, at 4:00am, we actually got the server to connect to the mysql database, and we could run the servlets to modify the database. It was much, much harder than we ever thought it would be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the most important accomplishment was actually creating a final and functional product in 24 hours. Being on a great team and making something innovative was an accomplishment alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate as a team to form a final product in only 24 hours. None of us on the team have ever been to a hackathon, so being able to collaborate and create something from scratch was truly a educative and fun experience that taught us technical and entrepreneurial skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for UDown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UDown is going to scale up and integrate with the greater Carnegie Mellon community.
