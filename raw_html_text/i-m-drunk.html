                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With drinking such a big part of so many people's lives, we thought that by creating an easy way to get home after a night out, we could prevent drunk driving as well as alleviate some of the difficulty of commuting across the city late at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You create an account, entering your home address and linking to your uber account. Then, when the time comes to head home, you simply press the red button and an uber driver will arrive shortly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the user interface first, and built our framework and python functions around that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MANY. As first time web developers, our group had never before encountered frameworks, databases, and APIs. Each of these embodied a large hurdle for our group to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While our site isn't fully functional, the fact that we even got a website up and running is an accomplishment in its own. We are especially proud of getting the front and back ends to interact, as well as setting up our first database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot. We refreshed our HTML and CSS skills, while learning a bunch of other stuff (including SQLite, Flask, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for I'm Drunk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully incorporate the uber API into the site and make it fully functional.
