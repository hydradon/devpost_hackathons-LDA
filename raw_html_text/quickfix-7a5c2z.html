                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have noticed a lack of communication between public bus organizatons such as the STM  and their users. Their seem to be many problems concerning the bus schedules, how crowded they are and lack of information between the two of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will allow you to do two main things. One is communicating with another user, and the second is communicating with the public transport organization itself. By pressing a button the moment you get on the bus, you allow the user who is waiting at the next stop to know whether the bus was late or early to the stop before. We also have features such as sending feedback, asking for more bus stops or for the busses to pass more often. We also have a reward system to give users the incentive to let others ahead know when the bus got to the stop.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We are using Android Studio and coding the program in Java. Our art is also done in photoshop.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving incentive for the users to click the button when they get on the bus to let know whoever is on the stops ahead of the current bus location.

                <p>
                    This is actually our first big project individually and as a group so being able to come up with a concept for an application and carrying through the execution is already a big accomplishment for us

                <p>
                    Add more customization. We want this application to be as user friendly as possible and allow our users to customize it to their desire.
