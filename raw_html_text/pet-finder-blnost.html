                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that helped the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was made to help people who lost a pet to find their pets easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a website using the LAMP stack that uses MySQL and PHP to fetch data that would be used on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble on how to start an actual website, but we were able to get a temporary functional website to use. We experienced difficulties with the slideshow of the pictures of the pets in the homepage but used the slick jQuery plugin for the slideshow carousel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're seniors in high school that wanted to improve our programming skills, but we not only learned a lot but also managed to get a properly working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use jQuery plugins to simplify the creation of complex parts of the website. We learned about storing hashed passwords in a database and how to check the entered password to the hashed password in the database. We discovered PHP's session variables which helped us keep a way to keep a user logged in.
