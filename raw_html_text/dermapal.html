                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What sparked the idea of this project was our personal experience of acne. Acne is a confidence destroyer for people of all ages who suffer from it. Like many people that encounter acne, it was difficult to determine the cause of acne and even more difficult to figure out how to get rid of them given the many types of acne that look similar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DermaPal takes an image of your face and identifies the most prominent type of acne that you have. It provides a description of the acne, what causes the acne, and how to treat it. It also lets you know what type of product to use for that type of acne.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using React JS for the front end and Node JS for the backend. Using Clarifai's machine learning API for image recognition, we were able to generate predictions for each acne type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are both beginners in web development, we took quite some time figuring out how things worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our second hackathon and given the amount of time, we are proud of being able to build something that is meaningful to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the first hackathon to the second, we learned how to set realistic goals and manage our time better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DermaPal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DermaPal can be used to send reports with patient information to companies like curology where they make custom skincare products tailored to a patient's skin type and mailed to your door. This saves the hassle of finding out which one out of the hundreds of skincare products in the drug store works for you.
