                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we have been given new power over your finances. As many reports have stated, millennials are notoriously bad at managing their money. We wanted to solve this problem that affects us and our friends.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zimali is a gamification tool to teach personal finance. On the website, a user is presented simple explanations of important financial terms and systems they should be aware of. As a user completes certain tasks, they get rewarded for their experience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Capital One API called Nessie to simulate a customer with several banks accounts. We also added a system to track transaction history, instead of only individual purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time using Meteor.

                    What's next for Zimali
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more quests and more detailed financial information from experts.
