                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired after looking at our recent purchase history in the month of September. We noticed that since many of us did internships over the summer, our income is gradually becoming less and less. As high school students, we knew that we wouldn't have much money to spend and knew that we needed to watch our spending until we were able to secure other internships. Since most people like to shop on their computers, we figured that a chrome extension would be the most viable option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm takes into account a number of different parameters including your after-tax income, how often you get paid, how much you have in savings and your recent purchase history. When you click this chrome extension on the product page of something you want to buy, the extension will output a score. This score is between one and ten and determines how financially responsible it would be to purchase the certain product. A score of 9 would mean that the product would be well within your means to purchase and a score of 3 would mean the opposite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end web page was built using HTML and CSS and the extension itself was built using javascript. The back end was built using Django with the Surveymonkey API, XE API, and the QuickBooks API. The algorithm was built in python using machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we ran into were integrating the API's into the back end of the program, setting up the CSS of the chrome extension to make sure that it was well coordinated with our theme and training the algorithm to make it more accurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that, as high school students, we were able to create and algorithm that helps people of all ages determine if a purchase is financially responsible. We are also immensely proud of the fact that we were able to integrate the back end and the front end of the extension seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate APIs into the back end of chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TwoCents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan to make this chrome more accurate by training it with a larger set of test data. As well, we could take into account if the price is discounted and if so by how much.
