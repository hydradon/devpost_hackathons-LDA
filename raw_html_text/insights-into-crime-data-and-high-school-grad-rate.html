                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Crime Data from the Chicago Data Portal we generated a heatmap of crime occurrences across the city. We then plotted high schools that were both on probation and not on probation. The blue dots are schools not on probation while the yellow is for schools on probation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data visualization tool allows you to filter the schools depending on what they were put on probation for
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using the Google Maps API, javascript for the page interactions and buttons, css to style the map and fonts and lastly HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was only one high school in the data for Chicago so we had to include middle schools in our analysis to find any meaningful correlation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plotting high school data across the country in relation to crime occurrences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data visualization requires a high attention to detail. Also I became familiar with the google Maps API and getting and putting requests in real time. I also learnt how to host websites on the MIT network.
                </p>

                    What's next for  Insights into Crime Data and High School Grad Rate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Include data for the entire United States and look at graduation rates instead of probation
Factor in more variables such as bullying, after school programs, and household income.
