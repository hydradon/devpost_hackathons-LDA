                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients over Europe and worldwide receive X-ray radiation for diagnostic purposes, and on many occasions receive it more than once in a given year.  Healthcare professionals (HCP) need to monitor these real world figures dynamically using a UI, which is user friendly and integrated in an app.  They are keen to know the determinants of exposure dose, for example, the region of the body, hospital, her/his own study practice, X-ray machine model, and so on, in order to compare the dose levels varying between these determinants.

                <p>
                    We tried to underpin these factors from real-world data by virtue of a proposed UI within the GE Digital Predix platform.
