                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by other shooter games and my mother's ideas for a fun, yet educational game that taught the users math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user uses the arrow keys to move and space bar to shoot. Gain points by shooting the sharks. Every few seconds, a math problem appears that the user has to solve to continue. The user must complete the math problem quickly because remaining enemies can still shoot them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not run into any difficult challenges, but it took a long time to make the enemy sharks disappear when they were hit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about how to work quickly and ignore distractions around me. I also learned that it is important to look at code around the perceived problematic code, and not just those few lines.
