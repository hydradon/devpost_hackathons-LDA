                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With life being so busy we thought that nutrition shouldn't suffer, so we came up with the idea of automating ordering food for you.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We try to predict which food is most suited to you, using our tinder-like swipe feature you can tell us which foods you like and dislike. Based on that data, the time of year and the weather (this bit doesn't work) we try to predict which meal is best suited.
