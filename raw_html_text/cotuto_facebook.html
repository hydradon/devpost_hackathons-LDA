                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the first moment looks like a small and interesting project. Looks like something that could be a complete deliver at the end of the hackathon.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It integrates with Facebook allowing the creation of events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I start with using Facebook graph API but have to change the strategy and build a "bot" that navigates on page to create the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no official support at Facebook to automatically create events so I have to build a bot that navigate on site. This bot was encapsulate on a regular class, so, write now, from the point of view of a Client of API, is just about "Save" a POCO class.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just make it work. I had a challenge, that at first look it was a easy one, but everything comes against me and at the end we have it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew that Facebook was used to support event creation using your API. As a short term challenge I couldn't confirm if everything still was as I knew, but when I try to use to ideal tool doesn't exists anymore. I came with a expectation that wasn't true anymore because the game changes.
