                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were bored and started looking at memes. The music got stuck in our heads, so we coded it to get it stuck in other people's heads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People send in keywords via sms to play a tune and the program plays it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked into other code made by people who knew what they were doing and adapted it for our own use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed the tutorials with help from our mentor to set up Nexmo messaging, a Flask web-server on the pi, and ngrok so that nexmo could access the web-server.  We almost had it set up but we had a mishmash with our ports, which took a while to spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sonic pi wanted the notes in midi form.  So we needed to convert from notes to midi.  We then found that the python OSC code we were using worked with standard notation so we had to convert it back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that the tunes are vaguely recognisable and that we were able to somewhat learn how to use sonic pi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code with Sonic Pi.
