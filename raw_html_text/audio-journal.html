                    Audio recordings hold lots of information, but unlike text, they're impossible to skim and difficult to organize.

                    Audio Journal lets you record or upload audio, and then automatically transcribes them, extracts keywords, and creates a summary.

                        have to listen to patients, take notes, and think about possible treatments all at the same time. No wonder it feels like doctors don't listen to you! Audio Journal helps doctors keep track of diagnoses, symptoms, and more, so they see the details of each individual plus big picture trends in disease outbreaks, with

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We built a mobile app that records audio, uses speech recognition to transcribe it, and sends that data to our backend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built an API that puts the audio and transcript in a database, and extracts keywords and a summary using natural language processing APIs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built a dashboard that lets users browse all their audio files, transcripts, keywords, summaries, timestamps, location, and more!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To show an example of Audio Journal in action, we built a map of disease diagnoses from hypothetical audio recordings of patients' medical appointments. This can help public health stakeholders prevent, predict, and respond to disease outbreaks.
