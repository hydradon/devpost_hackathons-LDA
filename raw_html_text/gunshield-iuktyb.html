                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original inspiration for our project was a sport called 'Crowd Ball', from the anime 'The Irregular at Magic High School'.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD6zQpeIuzk#t=2m41s" rel="nofollow">
                        Here
                    </a>
                    is a video example. Once we decided on the game being singleplayer, additional inspiration was taken from the game 'Arkanoid'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lets the user control a shield that can deflect a ball towards targets. If necessary, users may also use magnetism to cheat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Unity3D, Visual Studio, and GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a significant amount of Saturday fine-tuning the physics for the demo, something that took a surprising amount of effort to get a half-decent feel. We also ran into problems with version control on GitHub, specifically in losing progress due to overwritten work. In order to make up for lost time, we had to redo everything but we are still proud of how it turned out. Many challenges also came through learning animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the smooth animations of the targets and environment as well as the gun controller effects. We like the intuitive control system involving a remote force controller. We are proud that it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Math, had never used Unity before the event. During the course of the event, they taught themself the basics of the Unity animation timeline as well as the stage editor, as well as having written some of the Unity scripting used in our project. As a team we learned more about how Rigidbodies and forces work under the physics engine.

                        We want to make the ball physics even easier for the user so that rallies can be prolonged.
