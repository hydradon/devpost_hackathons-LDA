                    <strong>
                        The Problem:
                    </strong>
                    We were tired of trying to keep up with our professors in class. Do we try and understand what they are saying or do we just furiously write everything down?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What it does:
                    </strong>
                    Transcribes your professor's notes for you in short succinct batches for easy reading. Thus giving you not only the notes but a transcription of what the professor said while they went over their slides.

                    <strong>
                        How we built it:
                    </strong>
                    Leveraged Google Cloud to transcribe university lectures into short notes by coupling corresponding video and speech components to form a comprehensive study package for students.
Divided video lecture into distinct components by acquiring timestamps on slide changes using Google Cloud's Vision Intelligence API.Transcribed given lecture to correspond with slides using Google Cloud&rsquo;s Speech to Text API to allow for on demand searching of keywords

                    <strong>
                        Challenges we ran into:
                    </strong>
                    Most team members had 0 experience with machine learning and computer vision, and no one knew how Google Cloud worked.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                    </strong>
                    3/4 members had 0 hackathon experience and were able to learn a lot.

                    <strong>
                        What we learned:
                    </strong>
                    Python, Google Cloud's Machine Learning API's and their applications.
