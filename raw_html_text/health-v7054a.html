                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea of incorporating machine learning with health to improve the lives of diabetes patients, heart disease patients, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health++ suggests diet recipes and reminds you to take your medicine based on machine learning. It takes your information including weight, height, medical history, and generates a personalized diet that best suits your health condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS as our frontend platform and CockroachDB as our backend. We also used Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech APIs from Google to implement the chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not clear on what kind of information to store in the database and how to incorporate the back-end to the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a very good UI and some great features, such as speech-to-text and suggestions of diet for the users. We make great use of Google Cloud ML API in our project. We have a good vision in what our project will look like and decent structure to build on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned java spring-boot and CockroachDB API for back-end technology. We also understood how to make requests to Google Cloud to get speech or text information. Finally, we learned more about machine learning and how to better incorporate it into apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should continue to finish the implementation of the back-end service, connect to the front-end and deploy it. The machine learning model also needs improvement.
