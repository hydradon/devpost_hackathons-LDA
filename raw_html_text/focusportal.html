                    Have you ever learned a segment of code, and forgot what it stood for?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There are so many languages devs have to keep up with these days, that the process can be time consuming and annoying! DevDiary is here to help!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        I've always picked up skills by learning new languages and frameworks
                    </strong>
                    However as I often come back to these frameworks at different times, I often forget useful commands or snippets of code that I have researched before. So I thought it would be cool to create a place to save these snippets of code and hopefully integrate markdown and have a Developer Diary.
                </p>

                    Technical difficulties
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Everyone on our team is either brand new to web development or have just recently started. This project was a learning experience and we had trouble finding the right back-end to serve our purpose and developing a dynamic web program to service information to the client. The hardest part for us was developing the back-end server to service user diary snippets.

                    Improving developer's lives
                </h1>
                <p>
                    For developers who can't remember how to replicate something they've done/researched before, they can now look back at a dedicated code diary for them.
                </p>

                    What does it use?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It uses Firebase for authentication and keep track of user token and references it with our MongoDB to service data for that specific user.
                </p>

                    How does it affect a hackathon?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are a great place to learn new languages and you often discover new things from others. Having a centralized place to save these cool tricks into diary posts would be useful for future reference.
