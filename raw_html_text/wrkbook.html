                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WrkBook started as a learning project. Three months ago I wanted to learn IOS development and since my dad had a hard time finding a job I wanted to create an app that will help him find a job related to construction. The only way to find a job in construction is through connections and coming to a country knowing no one is extremely difficult, especially when it comes to finding a job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app connects contractors to construction workers(painters, electricians, designers... you name it)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift and firebase to build this app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to programming and having no one is challenging. I discovered stack overflow and a community of programmer called freecodecamp. Both resources helped me through this journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the app is not complete. I'm proud of the work I've accomplished so far. Coming to this country a few years ago not knowing anything about computers truly amazes me and its something I'm proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of programming and I discovered my love for programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for wrkBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to say that this Idea won The Zahn startup competition in my school. This summer I'm working with 3 other friends and we will be building the backend using nodeJs. I want to keep learning from this project and someday help millions of people like my father (regardless of where they come from) find jobs that they love.
