                    (arbitrary women's clothing sizes and the difficulties of purchasing clothes online when clothing sizes are based on vanity sizes and differ between brands)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you ever have to guess what clothing size to get when shopping online?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the world of clothing, where the size is made up and the labels don&rsquo;t matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are Survival of the Fitted, and we take the guesswork out of sizing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between brands, the same size jeans can have a FIVE inch difference in waist measurement! This makes shopping online both frustrating and difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a free web app that helps you find your size in three easy steps:
Tell us the size, brand, and style of your favourite pants and why it fits you best
Install our app
go shop through the app!
then
                    <em>
                        BAM
                    </em>
                    our algorithm will tell you which size to get regardless of the brand.
Nike, Levi's, Hollister: You name it, we got your size!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, Let&rsquo;s get down to business.
E-commerce in the fashion industry is a significant market. But the problem is, 20-30% of all online clothing orders are returned. This costs the industry 64 BILLION dollars every year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, fear not, because our product can fix that. By helping shoppers find their fit the first time around, we increase companies&rsquo; revenue by decreasing their return costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a business-to-business revenue model we charge top retailers a small transaction fee on purchases made using our site based on affiliate links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let&rsquo;s review:
We don&rsquo;t need body measurements from you.  We find your measurements through your favorite pair of pants that you tell us about. We are saving you from all the uncomfortable processes like personal measurements, picture taking and 3D scanning that others companies make you do.
It&rsquo;s free! we do all the work for you
It&rsquo;s a set it and forget it model. You set up your profile and our pop up will only appear with a sizing suggestion when you are shopping online
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every day, people are told that they&rsquo;re too big, or too small, when sizing is really the problem. It&rsquo;s time to stop this now, and with your investment, we can take the mystery out of clothing sizes.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a search engine that searches for clothes that fit the user based on the clothes they already have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected data from several people about the various jeans they own. We organized this data into groups, so the search engine would understand that jeans owned by the same person are roughly the same size. The search engine returns jeans that are the same size as the input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were hoping to use a SQL database on a web server to make sure the data the user received would always be up to date, but we weren't able to figure out how to set it up in time. As a result, we decided to make the program work on android using a SQLite database instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished the project and it works well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about databases, Android programming, and project management and team management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survival of the Fitted
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More data analysis would be useful, as well as a way to collect user data to improve the search engine. More data is necessary. Right now it only works with women's jeans, but data for all sorts of clothing would be useful in the future. Monetization is also an important step for the future of this app. Sponsored listing or affiliate links are options. Making the program cross platform would also be a good step for the future.
