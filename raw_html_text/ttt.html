                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has been about 4 years since I last made a GUI in Java. I have never been that comfortable with them, and Brick Hacks was a good opportunity to practice.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a two-person tic tac toe game. It keeps track of the current player and the score between the two players.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Java Swing to make the GUI.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found it difficult to get the labels at the bottom to align in one column.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm somewhat more comfortable with Java Swing than before. I might be able to create a GUI without a template, albeit, still needing to refer to sample code. I also learned how to connect the front end of a program with the back end, something that seemed intimidating before this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't think anything is next for TTT; however, I plan on carrying what I learned from this experience to more complex projects.
