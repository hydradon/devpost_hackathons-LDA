                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How can employers verify skills of employees in a simple and effective way before hiring refugees in digital jobs?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a system to conduct simple automated tests for different skills (translation, content creation, and more)
and aim to verify employee skills by allowing field experts to review results of these tests. A worker can then see what jobs are a fit for their skills and apply to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since refugee access to computers and the internet cannot be assumed, we developed our solution as a mobile-first web application. Using Django, we will enable job-seeking refugees to sign up using their phone number and a chosen password. After taking the first few tests, their score for each skill is a weighted average of the review scores of their tests.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Optimize for intermittant, low-bandwith connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build products with localization in mind.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that the product can attain trust with refugees.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What's next for Rezek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision a future with a simpler job applications process that will ultimately allow refugees to reach self-reliance and self-empowerment through employment. A reliable long term worker could then be recommended to recruiters for interview, creating a new platform for long-term hire of refugees.
