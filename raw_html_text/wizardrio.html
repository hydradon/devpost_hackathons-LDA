                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to make an increasingly more difficult tower defense game revolving around genetic algorithms. So after wasting twelve hours, and ripping our hair out, we just started drawing with a retro, pixelated style that we grew to actually kind of enjoy. It's really fun because the margin of skill to draw the figures wasn't necessarily all that high, but we were proud of the animations we ended up with, seeing as we had never really done either of the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a platformer gave with some hilariously illustrated characters and over-the-top exaggerated movements. The movesets are animated and integrated into the running and gliding movements of the character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to think of and illustrate most of the work on some pixel-art software I found online, which really wasn't optimal considering that we lacked both a mouse and a drawing pad. We ended up using the track-pack and the touchscreen, which was unsurprisingly horribly optimized for the task, although the torturous method probably contributed to the final artstyle.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a mouse for all but 10 minutes of the entire hackathon; the Gigabyte rep had to leave right after giving us the mouse. We used up two markers just brainstorming and doing all the character movement calculations on the whiteboards. And we both stayed up for the entire hackathon. Gettting a taste of Soylent was a challenge, as was drinking it unfortunately :(

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a terrible artist, but to have some mediocre drawings to my name isn't so bad. I also managed to conquer animating movements, which had daunted me for a while. I stayed up for two days straight for the second time ever, and drawing everything with a touchpad was really rewarding.

                    making more terrain, figuring out a story for the character, and adding more interesting quirks to the gameplay.
