                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was the number of destroyed homes we witnessed from the recent natural disasters. We read that approximately 90 percent of homes were lost in areas that experienced the worst of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. There is a dire need for shelters when natural disasters hit and sometimes there just aren't enough in some areas or the official shelters are just too far away. After seeing this need, we were inspired to make more shelters available by having people offer up their homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that contains two forms. One of the forms is for homeowners to input his/her name, phone, address, and any notes they will like to make. This information is stored in a database that we use to create markers of all the available locations that fit the capacity needs of the shelter seeker. The other form is for the shelter seeker to input their location so that our website can show on the next page locations that fit the person's capacity needs on a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The backend was built using Python and Flask. To connect the front-end and back-end we used JQuery and JSON. We used a Google map API and Geo-coder API to generate the map and marker locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of having javascript unable to read the data being sent by python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to utilize APIs for the first time and building a dynamic website with multiple webpages. We are especially proud that we learned how to take user input to create markers on a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better use flask, mysql, javascript, and bootstrap. In addition, we learned how to utilize APIs and integrate them into a website.
                </p>

                    What's next for Prepper Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to host it in the cloud and eventually, create an app so it will be more easily accessible than typing in a url.
