                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we travel in different cars, how many times do we wait/call for people in the car?
How many times we wished we get a ride with a friend nearby?
How many times do we feel like finding friends around us and hangout with them?
Knowing the current location of our friends/kids will save time us this pain and help us co-ordinate better
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a simple one time phone number based login, the user can create groups of friends/family. When a user invites his friend to join a group and when it is acknowledged by the other side,  they can view the people around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase for the back-end. The application is primarily with javascript, css, HTML. Cordova helps us host the application as an android/ iOS application. The mobile application thus can be made independent of platform.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    -Handling single page architecture
-Getting and plotting multiple locations in real-time
