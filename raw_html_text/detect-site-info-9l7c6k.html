                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever had to sift through a random news article and pondered at the end if it was just some gobbledygook ?

                    What it does

                <p>
                    A fake news detector chrome plugin, that sifts through all the data on a site and analyses the tone of the content

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plain old vanilla javascript, HTML and a dash of python APIs

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the right kind of API that fit our purpose to a T

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it would've been better to customize and train our own model rather than use some of the existing APIs as the functionality that they provided was limited.

                    What's next for detect-site-info

                <p>
                    The road ahead would involve training the model by harnessing the right data-sets and using that as an API to sort the news feed
