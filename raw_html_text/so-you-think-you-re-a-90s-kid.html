                    We got the domain name from domain.com of soyouthinkyourea90skid.com, but it didn't end up working. We ended up posting is on Banjo.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team are first time hackers and we wanted to realistically approach a project that could be completed within the time. Two of us are proficient in Javascript making the choice of language easy. We got out inspiration of the art from a popular 90s artist Lisa Frank and general 90s aesthetic. Our implementation was modeled after a 2d tile world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter the game as the unicorn and your objective is to collect all of the rotating stars. You have to avoid the UFO that chases you around the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used solely java script to create objects and sketch them into a canvas. The images were primary made in Paint Tool and animated in Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the longest time our entire grid was off by half a grid. We spent like half a day worrying about the alignment and it took a lot of time away from the implementations we planned to have. We deleted the idea of having collidable objects because of the time it took to fix the grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished most of our to-do list and we didn't need to shrink our beginning goal by much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript is terrible, but we learned to just keep typing until it works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe we can in the future add it so that the planets cannot be walked through.
