                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A company&rsquo;s forward progress is directly related to their ability to effectively take advantage of infrastructure and platform services from cloud providers like Amazon Web Services.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many businesses are delaying cloud deployments due to lack of education and skills required to participate in the software revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With over 25% of corporations identifying the lack of&nbsp;cloud expertise&nbsp;as the #1 challenge with cloud adoption, there&rsquo;s no other way through this problem other than&nbsp;education.  To provide individuals and organizations a common language of cloud fluency, AWS certifications provide a solid benchmark for measuring a shared understanding of cloud computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The QuizBot was created to help individuals and teams to collaboratively prepare for the AWS certification using Slack &mdash; and have fun learning about Amazon Web Services!  The founders of A Cloud Guru believed &mdash; and still believe &mdash; that cloud computing education can and will continue to be the single most important catalyst for personal and organizational transformation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuizBot can be invited to a team's slack channel, and then any individual can easily start an AWS learning session.  To initiate the QuizBot, simply type:
                    <code>
                        @acloudguru quiz me
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The QuizBot will respond with a question about an AWS service &mdash;and provide (4) possible answers.  Participants in the team slack channel can answer the question by simply selecting one of the possible answers.  QuizBot will respond to let everyone know who was the quickest to select the answer &mdash; and if their answer was correct!  To keep playing (and learning), the participants just need to click
                    <code>
                        yes
                    </code>
                    when prompted if they'd like another question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The QuizBot is already a huge hit in our internal slack channel, and the backlog of features is growing rapidly.  We are planning to add a scoreboard to encourage friendly competition.  To take full advantage of the capabilities of Amazon Lex, we'd also like to provide participants the ability to ask questions about a particular AWS service after a quiz question to explore a topic in more depth.  I addition to leveraging Amazon Lex, integration with Alexa voice services is a must-have feature!  Lastly, expanding the QuizBot to the Facebook messenger is another feature that we'll be working on for the next iteration!
