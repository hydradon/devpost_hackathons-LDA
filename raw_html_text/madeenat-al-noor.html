                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our one and only inspiration is a quote by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
                    <strong>
                        "Our country is blessed, and so are we, living on this good land."
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a challenging, but rewarding environment for all the customers of DEWA which not only provides a gamified approach to sustainability but also an interface for DEWA to contact their customers for any emergency updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with an awareness idea for little kids, wherein their pets or islands would grow depending on the green initiatives that they take. But, considering that to be a little basic we took it up a few notches and brought a game that adults would love to play, as they get rewarded for it too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed real-time data from DEWA to showcase how a consumer could realize the ways they could complete a few of our challenges. But considering the fact that the Smart Meters would be rolled out in a short while, we are sure that this would be something that would be cleared soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventhough our team is made up of veterans from hackathons, more than in other hackathons we learnt the true value of teamwork and discipline that would surely help us in future hackathons and also in any of our future ventures. And then we also learnt how to have fun while working which makes time go all the more faster and work all the more easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing replaces having the confidence that the backing of a good team gives, even if it's full of strangers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Madeenat Al Noor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will surely take it to the next step and try and negotiate a contract with DEWA that could help us get into the market and thus help our society attain a more sustainable tomorrow.
