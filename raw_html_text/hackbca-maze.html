                    Inspiration: I was inspired by one of my friends who had recently made a maze with Unity.  As for integrating a separate controller, I had initially the hackathon making a controller for league of legends. However I thought it had more application in the game I was creating with my friends, today.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: In the game, a player has to navigate their way through a single path maze. The player must navigate with a button matrix made with an Arduino Leonardo and a lot of buttons.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Starting with the controller, we connected push buttons with a Leonardo, breadboarded it, and then soldered it.  Building the game, I designed the maze on paper first, and then built it wall, by wall in Unity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The controller had soldering issues, there were time management problems, and there were also some technical issues with camera scripts.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: I am proud of the maze me and my partner, Jean, made together.   (Also I'm proud of Jean who spent 1am to 5am soldering all the buttons.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: I learned how to cooperate with people better and also about managing my time better when I'm on even less sleep than normal.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "HackBCA" Maze:  Together, me and Jean are going to make it functional and fix all the major problems, leaning more, and becoming less dumb everyday.
