                <p>
                    We are all students and as is normal we love food, avoid sport and want to save money and time. But what if we wanna eat a burger and have no clue how to combine our habits with our favorite burger restaurant? Exactly, find the nearest parking lot to the restaurant with the Google Assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    The best way for us was the infamous Trial and Error method. 
** Try, Error, being mad, eat, sleep, repeat. **
