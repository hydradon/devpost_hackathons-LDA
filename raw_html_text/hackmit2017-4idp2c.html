                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been frustrated in the past with both needing to switch between the Uber and Lyft apps and facing surge prices when we could have just walked a short distance to avoid them, so we wanted to create an app to prevent those annoyances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RideFair is a web app designed to allow individuals to get the best ridesharing prices via Uber and Lyft. It not only compares the prices for each app for each vehicle size, but also determines whether it would be cheaper for the customers to walk to an area with lower demand to avoid surge pricing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed, then split up the work and spent a lot of time learning about various things, and each coded various parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time with certain APIs, and json not allowing hashing (to our surprise).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built code from scratch and overcame challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about APIs, servers, databases, tokens, virtual environments, and time management as a team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RideFair
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve performance and add features that allow users to compare Uber and Lyft prices with other modes of travel, such as public transportation.
