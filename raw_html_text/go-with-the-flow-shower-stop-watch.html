                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people become more aware of how much water they use while showering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a stop watch that is connected to the internet. You start the watch by pressing the button before getting in the shower, and then stop it by pressing the button after getting out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on a Photon internet connected microcontroller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into lots of trouble with the hardware side of the project. Specifically getting the lcd display to work while not having an available "grove" port for the display cables to plug into on the Photon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud of the hardware, and proud of the programming that was done for this project in C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how to hook up LCDs to hardware, as well as how a pull-up resistor functions.
                </p>

                    What's next for Go With The Flow (Shower Stop Watch)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add a social component to the website, where you can compare your environmental footprint with others.
