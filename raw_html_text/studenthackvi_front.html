                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main source of inspiration was a game called Town of Salam, combing this with Kahoots form of play (using Twilio), and a Computer Science theme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game for you to enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is pure javascript which would be making API calls to a PHP backend (connected to Twilio).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges using Twilio, accessing networks, SSH and such, at the end we were able to make API calls, although the PHP API for the JS was not built in time.
                </p>
