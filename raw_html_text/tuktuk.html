                    Uber and Lyft can be useful resources, but sometimes you just want a quick ride.

                    TukTuk allows you to see every car owner nearby ready to carpool and lets you see their expected itinerary. It is then easy and quick to hope in a carpool up to your destination.

                        ## How we built it

                </p>
                <p>
                    We started by using Angular.js, but dropped in halfway in the hackaton for a more regular static website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also used Google Cloud Platform's app engine to host our website and the Google DNS Api. We also tried using .tech domains to make our website accessible.

                        ## Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We soon realised that Angular.js was way too complicated for what we were trying to do, especially since most of us weren't familiar with web front-end. We also encountered some difficulties validating the ownership of our .tech domain, made harder by the rather unfriendly interface used by the .tech domains website

                        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time the Google Maps Api rendered on our website page made us quite ecstatic. We're also very proud to have been able to deploy our website on the Google Cloud Platform's App Engine. We were finally able to access our website from anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## What we learned
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a first front-end web development experience for most of us so we definitely learned alot about Angular.js, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding. We learned how to use the Google Cloud Platform to deploy a static website. That also taught how the DNS system works, along with domain management. Most of all, this Hackaton really taught us how to work as a team!

                        ## What's next for TukTuk
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a database to the website, to keep track of users and more. A mobile app would also be a great followup to this project as it would help connect with a bigger audience. Finishing linking our Google Cloud Platform's App Engine to our tuktuk.tech domain once we are validated as owners of the domain.
