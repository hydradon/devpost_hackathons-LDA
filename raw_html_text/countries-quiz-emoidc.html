                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a kid, I enjoyed doing trivia about countries across the globe and the most frequent questions involved naming the capitals of some faraway country which you may have not heard of before. So I decided to do a quiz skill on Alexa which does the same adding a new twist of also asking about which continents the countries are located.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the skill is designed as a quiz where it asks questions about five countries. It can ask you about what the capital or continents for those countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built as an Alexa skill with Lambda function acting as the back-end service which provides the questions and checks the answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had not used the new ASK platform released recently where the entire task of creating the Alexa skill and the Lambda needed can be cone together as part of the single project. So trying that and figuring out the errors encountered during deployment were some of the challenges involved in building this skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the new Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) as well as a great revision and update of my own trivia skills while trying to answer the questions while testing the skill.

                    Add more keys that can be asked about any country like may be the languages or flags of the country.
