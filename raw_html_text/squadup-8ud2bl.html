                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a viral 911 phone call that made it onto major news headlines, one where a woman disguises her 911 call as a pizza order. We wanted people to feel more safe, whether they be victims of abuse or students traveling alone at night on college campuses.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sends an SMS message containing the user's location on Google Maps to various contacts following a unique user defined voice command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app on Android Studio and also used Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore to dynamically store and retrieve the contact information. Finally, the app incorporates the Google Maps API to determine and send the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big problem we encountered pertained to the process of retrieving the data stored on the Firebase. Additionally, we encountered some difficulties with integrating the Google Maps API into our project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thrilled to get the speech utility portion of our app to work as well as overcome the difficulties we faced in retrieving contacts' data stored on the Firebase.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we learned the basics of Github and Android Studio, as well as how to incorporate and utilize a variety of powerful APIs into our code.

                    What's next for SquadUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (1) We could make an urgent voice command that will send the user's location to ALL contacts in the database, instead of just one contact. 
(2) We could open a map view that shows location markers of previous locations where the user felt unsafe, as a reminder to be more alert. 
(3) We could integrate a ride share feature (ideally first in Metropolitan areas where ride share drivers are prominent), so that the closest driver can arrive at the location and drop the user at the nearest police station. In the future, SquadUp could additionally become a corporate social responsibility division of a major rideshare company, such as Uber or Lyft. 
(4) We could integrate more features once a code is , such as opening the user's camera so that they may begin recording video or take a picture of any dangerous situation/people for future reference. Additionally, we can add the option of a button to activate a loud noise/buzzer and/or a flash light in the case of a precarious situation to scare off attackers. 
(5) We can amass a network of users and create a map view of "danger zones" listing previous encounters, so that users may be more cautious.
