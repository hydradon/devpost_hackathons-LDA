                <p>
                    Uses google's api to sync your calendar and allows you to add events, see events and see upcoming events.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosted index.html and server.js on a nodejs server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally tried to use Angular to run google's api but had a lot of trouble with setting it up. As angular is a language developed by google we assumed it would be easy to integrate their api but nobody at the booth could assist. So we pivoted to a basic webpage.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully used the google calendar api and configured a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using google's api
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are hoping to complete this webapp that displays events in your life. It will also know when your available and will help you schedule study times. We ideally would like to track study times as well to alert people if they are under allocating time for their tasks.
