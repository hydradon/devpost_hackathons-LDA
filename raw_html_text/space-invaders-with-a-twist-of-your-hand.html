                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the Hackathon, I saw one of the Myo controllers, and decided that they looked like something fun to use in my hack. I decided to do it with space invaders because of the relatively simple control requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the rotation of your wrist, you can move your defender side to side, in order to dodge the lasers of the attackers, and to aim your own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went through the Myo API, and found some C++ example code that I could build off. I built upon that code, and created an application that translated rotation of the Myo into keyboard input. This whole time, Nikolai was building a simple space invaders game that could take these keyboard inputs and translate them into input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo API was slightly difficult to understand, and I ended up unsuccessfully attempting to write the rotation translation application twice, in Java and Python, before finally being able to pull it off in C++
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned C++, and I think I did pretty well for my first hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++, to plan at least half of your time to debugging etc.

                <p>
                    Perhapes a better or more detailed control scheme.
