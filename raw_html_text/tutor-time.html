                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us have participated in Rutgers study groups before which were really helpful in preparing us for our classes. We want to spread the ability to participate in study groups like this all over the world to encourage learning and help college students through their classes.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tutor time lets users create and find study groups in their desired area of study for low costs. Users have the ability to join study groups they would like and can split the tutor's requested amount between them. If a user has proficiency in a subject, they are welcome to start their own study group and make money tutoring others at the price they request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used technologies such as node.js, MongoDB, react, and yarn to put together a website that can host this service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was all our first time implementing MongoDB, so it was a great challenge and learning experience for all of us to get the backend and API service working.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Features such as chat rooms, and video calling within a group will be added. Users will also be able to split the cost how they choose if they wouldn't just want it to be split evenly.
