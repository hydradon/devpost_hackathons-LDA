                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life Alert requires a subscription to send help to a person. Additionally, you have to physically press the button for help. We wanted to create a project that would help detect a person falling or unconscious that would call for help- without that hassle of life alert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LyfeSaver 4.0 detects a person falling through the connected body piece. The signal is recorded and sent to your phone via Bluetooth and a message is sent to your phone and directed to 911 for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using an arduino 101, and coded the arduino and send a signal to the android NRF connect app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of problems as we both had trouble going through code since we didn't have a lot of prior experience. We had moments in which we asked "what comes next" and had to plan out how to send the signal and how to communicate from the arduino, to the phone, and vice versa. While most of our challenges were based on how to execute our plan, we went through them by brainstorming other methods of working out a signal.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried through this entire experience with no prior knowledge. This was our first Hackathon, and we were both total strangers before meeting each other over our interest in hardware. Our accomplishment of getting this far on the project with the little experience we had was amazing as it is, and to continue striving even after multiple moments of frustration was the biggest accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we always have to continue moving forward, even if the situation seems bleak. We also learned that even the most eccentric ideas can be useful in the development to the final product. We had many prototype ideas, and our final physical contribution still needs a lot more progress for future work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LyfeSaver 4.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand on this, but first we will need to gain knowledge on android app development and combine that with our hardware knowledge.
