                <p>
                    I want to gamify your experience from the second you step at the airport to sec you leave .So,to begin i wanted to share a story with you..... which really inspired me to build this app. My dad is a frequent flyer and he would usually be at the airport 3-4 hours early :(  before the flights actually leaves( sometimes the fight got delayed) and also sometimes for international layover we will be struck at airport for 15 plus hours :( For me i didn't really know what to do.I was so bored as a kid and i will cry and will have nightmares about it......I still do and i am 25 years now.The only thing i do now is go sit in a bar or take alot of selfies which i will post it on Snapchat or facebook. So, Airbelin challenge made me thinking?!?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    FYI, I was inspired by pokemon g0 :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why gamify user experience?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gamification on any app  have always succeeded in keeping millions of enthusiastic gamers across the world fully engaged. There are some aspects and dynamics that non-gaming apps unfortunately lack. Some of these include:
-Fun
-Stress busting
-Spirit of competition
-Sense of achievement
-Team playing and more

                </p>
                <p>
                    Offer Rewards: Mobile games offering rewards are extremely addictive. So, i thought why not improve the experience of people at Airport? Moreover, you may offer real as well as digital rewards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discounts:The discount coupon pop-up which is based on user geo location when the user gain points
                </p>
                <p>
                    Promote Competition: Apart from retaining the existing app users, acquire new ones by inspiring the former to challenge their friends and colleagues or people who at the same position because of the delay of the flights or have a long flight Layover.Specially, International flights...I have had more 16 hours flights delays or layover in past.

                    Building the entire ios app alone . So YAY

                    Gamification can really help Increase Engagement?

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am thinking on including   badges, levels, challenges, leaderboards etc
To sum up the psychology behind it, game dynamics use positive feedbacks (points, badges, status, progression, etc.) to build up the users&rsquo; motivation.So, i think this will really help :)
