                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually stores lack a way to track customer demographics. With our software built using opencv and IBM Watson's visual recognition api, customer profiles can be kept to improve add insights.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses opencv to track faces and eyes from a video source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In python, a video source is read and analyzed for faces and eyes in real-time. Frame by frame the video is transferred into gray scale, structures are highlighted and then compared with pre-determined shapes. If a frame is recognized to contain a face, it is then scanned for eyes. Faces and eye highlights are then presented in an overlay..

                    Future implementations with IBM Watson's facial recognition api would be able to build fully detailed customer profiles; what has been previously ordered; what is likely to be ordered; how often does a customer come back; probability of a customer returning.
