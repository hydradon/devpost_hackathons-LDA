                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to attempt to make a game without using a game engine. We had very minimal HTML5 and Javascript experience and so we decided to expand our skillset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a local client side face-to-face two player game. Each player moves around a box and is able to place walls blocking off the other player. With the map shrinking, and walls limiting movement the players must think quickly and on their feet in order to outwit their opponent. Last person standing wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 and JavaScript in the Sublime text editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tough trying to figure out collisions without having any physical objects. Making walls prevent character movement was definitely a hard implementation considering we do not have any meshes or colliders. Similarly figuring out if the player was boxed in was also difficult. We also had some issues with optimization where our frame updates took longer to do than the frames refreshed; as such many of our functions were rewritten in order to allow efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a fully functional HTML5, Javascript game from scratch without using any already existing platform makers. Figuring out all the algorithms and seeing them work in the end is something that we are DEFINITELY proud off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of javascript notation and functional programming. HTML5 and CSS were also used to style the final result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Walled Off
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being posted online so that anyone is able to play the game!
