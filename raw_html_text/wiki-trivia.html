                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a world where everyone is connected on social networking sites. Wiki Trivia is here to provide educational value in a popular channel -- Messenger. Chatting on Messenger can be rewarding and intelligent!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are developing a Facebook Messenger chatbot that communicates with you and your friends on Messenger to quiz you like in Jeopardy. You can get hints, keep track of your stats, and compete with your friends with a leaderboard to understand the world as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python Heroku, PostgreSQL, React and are now integrating with Facebook Messenger API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced difficulties testing the Messenger API, so we could not finish the Facebook Messenger part in time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Many people like our idea and prototype so far!

                    What we learned

                    It's difficult to know for sure how successful the app can be for everyone in the world
