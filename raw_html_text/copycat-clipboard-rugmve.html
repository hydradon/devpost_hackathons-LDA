                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all had the problem that whenever we copy something, the item previously copied gets deleted which makes it harder to gather information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CopyCat Clipboard allows users to copy multiple items without them getting deleted which makes it super effective for gathering information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built CopyCat Clipboard using  JavaScript and HTML5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned for highlighted text to automatically get copied but that didn't work. Also getting the previously copied item to show was a challenge but we finally figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we have a working product and that it does its most important job which is saving previously copied items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate effectively in a group and also learned a bit of JavaScript. We learned that thinking of ideas is actually easier than actually making them come to life. We also learned to be resilient and that all work is never perfect and there will be always be errors and bugs that need to be fixed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CopyCat Clipboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan for CopyCat Clipboard to have the ability to save copied items and collectively summarize and produce study notes. It will not only be able to copy text but also copy multiple videos and images. You will also be able to see the time, date and website the information was copied from to make citations way more easier. Finally, you would also be able to select from various colours of highlight to organize notes better.
