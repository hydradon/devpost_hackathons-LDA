                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in machine learning and wanted to implement Watson's Visual Recognition API to 
create something that would be useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android app to quickly identify and pull up information from google on flowers and various other objects. Powered by IBM Watson. Made for UofTHacks V (2018).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Android Studio using Watson's Visual Recognition API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App crashing due to incorrect landscape mode implementation.
Finding and understanding the substantial amount of documentation.
The API would sometimes return inaccurate data.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a better understanding of how to efficiently go about using new APIs
Kept on trying to solve our problems no matter the circumstances
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more experience in Java
How Watson's APIs work at a high level
                </p>
