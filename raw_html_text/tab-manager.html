                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came from one of our members always keeping his tabs open for future reference, but never clearing it, eventually leading to a congestion of tabs on Chrome which uses alot of computer resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tab manager extension loads the active window's tabs as icons, and provides different sections. The icons can be dragged to different sections. Clicking on an icon brings the user to that tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension was built using React framework and Javascript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along the way, we ran into many challenges:

                    <li>
                        Problems with implementing original features (initially intended to add a button to insert additional sections, scaling down to fixed number of section)
