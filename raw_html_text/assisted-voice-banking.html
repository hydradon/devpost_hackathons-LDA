                    The Bot Assisted Banking project is able to take voice instructions and make financial decisions accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used bot to interact with the user. We invoked Capital One Hackathon API for the required data, and created a bridge between the APIs and the voice analyzing bots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team was working to add some more definitive features to the project, but not all were very feasible at this point because of the time constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are really excited to be able to give voice to the conventional online banking experience. We also believe that this idea can be a basis to a whole new practice of online banking in the days to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to making the bot more interactive or perhaps using a strong AI. We also plan to add more operations like money transfers and so on in coming days.
