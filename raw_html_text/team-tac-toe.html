                    No more boring breaks in lecture halls! Enter Team Tac Toe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This brand new app will provide a very precious tool to lecturers to start a match between all members of audience!

                <p>
                    Inspired by many Mentimeter questions in lectures, we decided to take the crowd voting mechanism further: to a group game. We present Team Tac Toe - a crowd voting-based tic tac toe game. Enjoy this unforgettable experience during you next break between lectures and beat the other half of the audience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app praises collaborative approach and helps to build team spirit across entire audience in a hall. This is applicable far beyond university lecture halls to any group events such as workshops and conferences.

                    When a user visits our website, they can either create a game room or join one using a 6 digit room code. Upon joining, they are assigned to a team with which they play a game of Tic Tac Toe. Each user gets to vote once per turn for the best move their team should make and the most popularly voted turn is chosen as the move. Each side has a 20 second timer to vote after which the moves are made.
