                    A simple game where you try to avoid popping a balloon.

                <h2>
                    Our Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Oct 7, our team arrived at Knighthacks, ready for a spirited night of hacking and collaboration. After long hours of brainstorming and discussion, we finally reached two possible ideas: an app to help one of our student organizations with logistics and a fun virtualization of a reality show game. We weighed the challenges and tasks of each idea, then weighed them again, but we ultimately decided on the game since we were more passionate about our ideas for it. And that's how we decided to create That Blows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a well-deserved dinner and some snacks, we settled on the game rules. Players take turns guessing a number between 0 and 100. If they don't guess the "lucky number", then the range changes so that the next player has less numbers to choose from, and the balloon gets bigger. When a player finally guesses the chosen number, the balloon pops and they have to live with title of "Balloon Popper", until the next round of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AND to make it more interesting, we added different difficulty levels and the ability to say your numbers instead of typing them into the screen. Enjoy playing this game with friends and family when you're at a sleepover, at a party, at a family reunion, or even just chilling at a random place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Was Made
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Korean barbeque. That's really about it.
