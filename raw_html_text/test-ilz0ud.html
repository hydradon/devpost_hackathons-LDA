                    We were inspired by beautiful works of street art. Adding one's own creative twist to a building, pathway, or even something as simple as a bench, is a great way to innovate and connect with our home and community. It's the age of technology, and we thought it would be a great idea to connect the residents of Kitchener through art and tech.

                    After visiting the gallery and taking the spotlight photo, use interactive leap motion sensor to create art at the power of your fingertips. Save and upload your art onto the website and share for the world to see. If using mobile, use our art mobile app and also scan the photo using AR to create art using the touch screen. Upload onto the website using google cloud storage to store hundreds of thousands of images from people around the world.

                    Our project consisted of multiple components: a website to display works, an app used to snap photos of the environment, and the Leap Motion sensor. The webpage was made using bootstrap, and editing the html and css/sass. The app was created using Android Studio. OpenCV was used to apply augmented reality to a snapped image. Lastly, Firebase was used to act as a server to send and store edited images from the app to the website.

                <p>
                    As a novice first year stem students who have very little knowledge in programming languages, we learned to use android studio, OpenCV, HTML/CSS, firebase in very limited time to develop this project. Since we did not know how to use these languages in the beginning, we had difficulty running and combining our individual codes together. It was also very difficult to juggle making a website, art making app, camera AR and linking firebases together due to limited time and very little knowledge in tech.

                <p>
                    We used languages we have never learnt before and managed to create an amazing product that will bring the community closer together through the power of art. We managed to juggle making a website, art app, camera AR and implementing motion sensing into our project for more interactive events to take place at the gallery.

                    We learned the importance of research and how to quickly learn new technologies under a timestrain. We also learned that not everything will go as planned. We originally had more ideas, such as a voting system for the public to vote on art pieces. However, once we got started after a long brainstorming session we realized that simply learning the basics of each language/technology could take hours, and debugging was a whole other journey. In the end, we're glad that we aimed high, but in the future it would be wise to start with something simple and complete it nicely.
