                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every 2-3 months I start logging the food I eat to take the control of my weight with the goal to lose it. After a couple of weeks, usually it becomes time-consuming and boring, and I gradually drop tracking food intake. The voice interface is much faster and more intuitive and I&rsquo;m sure it will help me to say on track and live a healthier life. Food Journal Skill allows logging food 5x faster! Such breakthroughs really inspire me!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Journal Skill lets users log the food you eat and water you drink into your Fitbit account with Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with understanding how users will track their food and water consumption. I did several interviews with my friends and colleagues and realized that core feature of the skill is tracking, not summary or food information.
After that I focused on conversation design &mdash; utterances, slots and possible edge cases. Kept in mind it should be as simple as possible and cover core functionality.
Finally, having experience with python I chose Django as a framework and started development of the skill.
First iteration was water tracking, as a result I got understanding how actually interaction model and intents work.
In second iteration I was working on food tracking, faced with several things &mdash; matching Amazon. Food slot type with Fitbit library, articles a / an / the, &lsquo;two&rsquo; and &lsquo;to&rsquo; in utterances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I setup ~100 test phrases, wrote a simple script to perform tests using ASK CLI, did test manually sitting with my Alexa device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Result is &gt;90% success rate of precise understanding and tracking food and water consumption.
                </p>
