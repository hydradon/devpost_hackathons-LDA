                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Today's world we see everywhere Robotic Process Automation taking over, I was thinking can we make something which can handle our development repositories own its own. This is a small prototype with mass creation of repositories which will be extended  in further versions bringing in intelligence to resolve conflicts and issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a  reusable flow where mass creation of github repositories is being done.In next version we would like this to be integrated with a chatbot as a feature. In later version this project will be extended bringing in intelligence to resolve conflicts, merging, pull request, issues etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very simple, you have an excel template with detail of all repos to be created which is read by the UIPath and then JSON requests are formatter and REST API calls for Github happens
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Formation of JSON body data before sending the request

                <p>
                    I came up with something useful in such a short span of time.
