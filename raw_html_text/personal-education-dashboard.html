                <p>
                    Our current grade reporting systems are underwhelming, only displaying grades and GPA. We found that this deters us from checking on it regularly. We wanted to create a way of not only viewing academics but also connecting with teachers and students

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with vue.js in the vuestic admin framework. It is hosted in AWS, with the back-end being written in Python (back-end not fully implemented in this build)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud gave us a few issues, especially with App Engine, so we decided to move to AWS. We also experienced confusion in dealing with Vuestic Admin's templates.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS also proved to be tricky but we were able to figure it out working together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Kiran R) learned a lot more on Python 3.7, a language I'm very new to, and use of AWS. Shashank learned about vue.js and how to implement in into Vuestic-admin.
