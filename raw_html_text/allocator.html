                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn more about the under the hood of C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to allocate blocks of memory, much like malloc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used sbrk and brk to get pages of memory from the OS. I then had arrays to keep track of what blocks were in use and which ones weren't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping track of the block layout and "freeing" them properly, as well as knowing minimizing fragmentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How sbrk/brk work, (a little bit of) how malloc works under the hood.
                </p>
