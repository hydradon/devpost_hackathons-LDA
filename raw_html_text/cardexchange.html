                    We were inspired to pursue this project seeing that people had a tedious time exchanging a variety of different contact info at social/networking events.

                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Ionic and its libraries to program the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ionic gave us a lot of issues when trying do version control with git. Moreover, Ionic threw some error that required us to spend hours debugging our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments are that we created a nice interface and partially got NFC data transfer working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an online database and exchange data. Moreover, we learned how to develop a clean mobile app layout, as well as fix various issues Ionic poses.
                </p>

                    What's next for cardExchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish up the data exchange using NFC, as well as give users more flexibility in editing their profiles and saving other peoples' contact information.
