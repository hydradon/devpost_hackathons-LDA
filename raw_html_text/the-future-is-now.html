                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we walked outside and had a discussion about how the climate had been volatile lately, we had an inspiration about what we could do to help the cause for stopping climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is a website that caters towards kids for the purpose of educating them about climate change in an interactive way. Using location data, we show how their area is being affected and how it's going to be affected in the future so it's easier for the children to relate to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using Javascript and the NOAA API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed two systems independently without planning beforehand for later integration. This led to difficulty later when integrating the code together for developing the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing specific location data to bring a personalized experience for each user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate APIs within a javascript framework. We also learned a valuable lesson in discussing the framework beforehand to mitigate these issues later down the line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Future is Now
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we aim to bring more features to the website to inform children in a fun and interactive way about the climate change crisis currently going on, using the location data for each user for each of these new features.
