                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the theme for this event was about the internet of things, our team thought of how far Smart Home technology has come. As we began to brainstorm about what our design would be, we began to gain interest to figure out how Smart Home technology actually works, especially the connectivity side of things. We believed that a simple design like designing a detection system would be the best for all of us to gain knowledge about connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the ultrasonic sensor, the buzzer increases in pitch and the LED increases in intensity as the person approaches the sensor. As you move further away from the device, the buzzer decreases in pitch and LED decreases in intensity. Additionally, the app can be used to turn on/off the buzzer and LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Arduino circuit board, Raspberry Pi.
The server was built using Python and application with Java (Android Studio). 
Devices used on breadboard included ultrasonic sensors, transistors, buzzer, and LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge that we failed at was when we insert a transistor to simultaneously power up the Raspberry Pi with all other components, as it began to interferes with the ultrasonic sensor. We couldn't properly get readings from the sensor, causing our buzzer and LED to produce the wrong output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the ultrasonic sensor to work and were able to relate distance to the amplitude of the buzzer's sound and the intensity of the LED light's brightness. In addition to that, we created our own server and application to control the unit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect circuits on the breadboard, how to use the Arduino IDE, create a Raspberry Pi Server Connection, and learnt about software and hardware integration between the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the breadboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ultra-burglar Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the transistor work together with the breadboard, and increasing accuracy of ultrasonic sensor readings.
