                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A student resident of CLO wishes to make daily life easier for the residents and staff alike by creating a web app that automates tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app provides a login for residents that allows them to opt-in to their late dinner plate, as well as view recent news about their community. We store their login information during registration and authenticate their logins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do web development using a different method from what we've used in previous projects. We also learned a lot about Google Cloud and Firebase services in order to create backend for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully flesh this app out by allowing for more secure usage, as well as polish on the features. We want to add features such as chore swap and admin rights.
