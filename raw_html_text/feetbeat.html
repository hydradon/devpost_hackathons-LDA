                    Do you run while listening to music? Have you ever wished that the song you're playing matches the pace of your running?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FeetBeat is a music player with an additional feature that enables the song to be sped up or slowed down to match the pace of your running.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with our blood, sweat, and tears... along with
                    <strong>
                        a thousand bags of chips
                    </strong>
                    that will all turn into calories we'll have to burn by running with this app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the different technologies took way more time than we had anticipated, so we had to prioritize our actionables given the limited time we had for this hackathon. Starting to think about the idea at the start of the hackathon, we also had to spend a considerable amount of time designing the whole system.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, it sorta works. But more importantly,
                    <strong>
                        we made meaningful relationships.
                    </strong>
