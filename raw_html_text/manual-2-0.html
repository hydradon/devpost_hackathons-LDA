                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outotech challenge was interesting, but we didn't stick with it at first. After few chats with Outotech crew we felt like we could provide a solution for their problem. So we took a risk and changed our track at the last moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides maintenance support particularly for remote sites, utilizing locally stored interactive 3D models. Models consist of components with their own state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a concept level idea, that we built around possibilities of 3D technology with augmented reality on mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it hard to develop a demo for a concept of this extent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud about the concept where the machine acknowledges its own state and provides data for the personnel on site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mostly learned a lot about teamwork and that everyone in the team provides one's own knowledge. We learned about the mining industry and how companies like Outotech supply heavy machinery and maintenance for the machines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Manual 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manual 2.0 is easily expandable and we are looking forward for the AR implementation. We believe that Manual 2.0 will be implemented to ALL industrial machines in the near future.
