                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an iOS developer and storyboards (iOS drag and drop UI builder) have always been love hate relationship. It abstracts you from the truth, you don't have the code, and it never works perfectly. This project is a solution to my and many others problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a drag and drop UI builder that exports the code directly. Giving you the benefits of a UI builder but all the benefits of having the code. And being able to export to multiple OS's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Java. I chose Java so it would be easily deployable to both Windows and Mac.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exporting code for Android. Android Studio did not want to work for me, so its hard to know if what im outputting is correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going from design to a fully functioning UI with full access to code takes a matter of a minute. Also being able to have View's in one project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about project structure, to make sure you never repeat your self and code in as little lines as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for oneUI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exporting code to more platforms, as well as better auto align to work for all screen sizes.
