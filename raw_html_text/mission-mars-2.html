                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love building games, I love to bring excitement to people and I want people to be entertained!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where you must dodge enemy spaceships, but there is a huge surprise of space penguins!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in swift, and used sprite builder. I used my knowledge from Make School when I attended in summer 2015!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered various challenges such as figuring out a scoring system, how I would implement the enemies as well as how the user would control the spaceship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to complete a second app all on my own! It was great to see my dream come into a reality and it is so cool that I was able to accomplish my life long dream of creating an app for the people!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned swift, I learned to be patient and work hard and you will succeed! I was always rushing to put a game out but I took a step back and I just focused and took my time to make the game as amazing as I could do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mission Mars 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to implement special abilities and possibly a shooting mechanism.
