                <p>
                    DecentPost is a protocol for decentralized postal services and apps, with Proof of Delivery, bonded shipping, and bounty slashing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DecentPost is designed to incentivize Senders, Couriers, and Receivers to transact in trustless shipping arrangements by structuring economic incentives on chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concretely, our contract implements the ERC721 interface (with help from OpenZeppelin) to allow a Sender to mint a non-fungible Package. Metadata regarding the Package is stored on IPFS. And we implement a psuedo-State Channel to allow for an expedient delivery experience + flexibility in choosing when to commit a transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Packages available for pickup are discoverable just by listening to the event logs we emit, and are tradable via the ERC721 interface.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Sender - creates Packages, which constitute an Offer for Shipment

                    <li>
                        Courier - agrees to Offers, transmits Packages, and collects Proofs of Delivery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receiver - can dispute receipt of package

                <h1>
                    Incentives
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A Shipper can specify a Bond, which a Courier must place in escrow to accept the Offer for Shipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are incentivized by a Bounty, which the Shipper places in escrow on Package creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Shipper also specifies a Deliver-by date, after which the Bounty will be slashed every second.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the Shipper specifies a public key address of the intended Recipient.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Proof of Delivery
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The experience of receiving a package under ideal conditions from a modern centralized courier is excellent: typically you sign a digital handheld device or show ID, and the transaction is over quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Couriers and Recipients are busy, and neither party wants to wait, but it can sometimes take some time to have a transaction mined in a new block, or fees may be temporarily high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To facilitate transactions, we have developed a concept we call Proof of Delivery, where the Recipient must prove to the Courier they are the intended Recipient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the package arrives, the Recipient must sign a transaction with their private key, proving they control the address the Shipper addressed the Package to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Proof of Delivery is saved, and can later be added to the blockchain at the discretion of the Courier. When a Proof of Delivery is mined, the Courier's is paid out their Bond + Bounty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should the Recipient dispute receipt of the package, the Courier can prove otherwise.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Adversarial Conditions
                </h1>
                <p>
                    If the timestamp in a Proof of Delivery is after the Deliver-By date, the Bounty is slashed.
When the Drop-Dead time arrives, the Sender is paid out the Bounty + Bond.
If a package is undeliverable, a Courier can ReturnToSender.
