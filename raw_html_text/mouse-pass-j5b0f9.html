                <h2>
                    What is MousePass?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MousePass is a passwordless authentication service that takes advantage of the human ability to retain childhood events and memories to create a fun, easy, and secure way to log into any major retailor or banking service. This is a innovative leap in the cybersecurity industry that is seemingly simple yet thouroughly sophisticated. By simply answering a few personalized questions about your life, you forego putting in a long, complicated, and easy to remember password and enjoy an effecient machine learning assisted experience in accessing your personal files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MousePass utilizes Machine Learning to create a more secure environment for logging into accounts. By tracking the movement of your mouse as you select an answer, we can effectively and quickly identify hesitation and confusion in the subliminal actions of a intruder. According to a 2017 study by Tianjin University, an intruder will hesitate much longer to answer an unexpected question than someone responding truthfully, and an intruder's mouse also will take a far different trajectory. By keeping track of all of these factors in our Machine Learning model, we create a very secure and reliable method to identify intruders and keep user's personal information safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the Pew Institute, about 49% of internet users write down their password on a pice of paper and 24% save them in a note on a computer or mobile device. These security methods are often adopted by those unwilling to join the 12% of the population who have adopted password managers. MousePass has the capacity to solve this security issue for nearly half of all internet users, allowing them more security without inconveniencing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our goals with MousePass is to assist the elderly population in becoming more secure online and less vulnerable to scam artists and phishing attacks. The Pew Institute continues that "older users are more likely to say they primarily [wrote] thier passwords down on a piece of paper". Technologies such as password managers and two factor authentication are not often utilized by the elderly, with 61% reporting that they do not use two factor authentication. MousePass utilizes a simple interface which is easily accessible to those of all ages and greatly increases the security of our grapdmnas and grandpas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even among those technologically adept, just 30% of "online adults worry about the overall security of their online passwords" and just 14% use complex passwords rather than simple ones. MousePass solves this by removing the need for passwords at all, instead relying on the human nature to remember intimate and special momories. Logging into your account with MousePass is simple and effective, yet fun and exciting.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built MousePass using Java, Python, and Google's TensorFlow, as well as PyCharm and NetBeans and GitHub to tie everything together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges in our journey, from having to start with no knowledge of machine learning to simply python incompatibilities. Throughout each of these challenges, we learned a lot about the intricacies of TensorFlow, Java, and Python, creating new methods and systems to accomplish our tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot through this competition, from the basics of Java to the complexities of data analysis in TensorFlow. Our ability to overcome each of these hurdles and create this complex applet in just 24 hours, linking together Java, Python, and TensorFlow. Our teamwork ship was nothing short of amazing, as we kept roughhousing to a minimum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MousePass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would love to create a function to generate possible intrusions and test how effective our machine learning algorithm is in defending against attackers. We want to expand into the industry, removing the need for complex and easy to forget passwords worldwide.
