                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members is learning Chinese, and as a non-native speaker, it is often difficult for her to learn the correct pronunciations that are central to Chinese.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website aims to teach both Chinese meanings and pronunciation. A user may edit others' practice sets or create their own, and our website uses speech recognition to determine if the user is pronouncing a phrase correctly. If the user is unsure of how to pronounce something, the website also has a text-to-speech feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right APIs was difficult because we needed compatibility with Chinese. We ended up testing out quite a few for speech recognition and text-to-speech.
