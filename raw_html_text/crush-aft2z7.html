                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Busy schedules, the love for procrastination and desire to learn more effectively inspired us to make Crush!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crush helps students learn better by generating questions based on their textbooks and PDFs submitted.
We also have sharing capabilities so that students can share their notes and progress with their peers. They can also compete against their peers in quizzes. This creates a community around learning and further reinforces learning outside the classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Tensorflow, PyTorch, Postgresql, python, Figma. Crush converts the user submitted pdf into text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then it uses the text to generate questions and answers as well for students to test their understanding of the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parts of the project involving front-end took a lot of time as most of the people on our team have little or no experience doing front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to implement cutting edge machine learning was certainly no easy feat for a 36-hour hackathon. As well, being able to pull ANY PDF textbook page/image and have a bunch of questions ready to test your knowledge in less than a minute is pretty nifty!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate a bunch of different frameworks and technologies to make this application working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate the ability to record lectures so that students can record the lectures and have notes and questions generated automatically!
