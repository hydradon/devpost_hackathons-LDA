                </h2>
                <p>
                    This extension searches for the news article headline in fact checking sites like snopes.com and gives an indication of the authenticity of the news item

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Javascript to build an extension for Chrome. We use XMLHTTPRequests in the background to get more info regarding the authenticity of a news item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to make something that will help to counter the nefarious ill effects of 'fake news' on society at large. We built this extension in a single day and we are not going to stop here.

                    That if one is committed, something cool and useful can be built in a short time.

                    What's next for Fake News Detection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the methods. We will be moving to a model with a server that will take the load off from the client chrome extensions. The server will employ methods of machine learning and natural language processing to improve the accuracy of our reporting and also to ensure that client computers are not slowed down at all.
