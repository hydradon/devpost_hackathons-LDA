                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Usually when I make my coffee in the morning and then sit by computer, after 20 min I find my coffee cold, because I got carried away, so it would be cool if mug could remind me to drink my coffee if I forgot it myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) How does long distance relationships work? member? its all about sharing the moment, and we think, that a great moment to share would be morning coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) How about some statistics?

                <p>
                    1) Tries to determine if you forgot to drink your coffee and reminds you if you did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We created an app which detects if you and your partner drinks coffee at the same time and displays something special if you do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Display ow many people are drinking coffee with you right now.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We try to discharge Muki battery by frequent querying and based on battery lifetime we determine if there still is a hot beverage in the mug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We created a server side application which receives info about your and your partners coffee activity from your phone and if you share the coffee moment with your partner it informs both android apps about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Same server side application gives the number of people drinking coffee right now.

                <p>
                    Understanding Muki OpenAPI.
First time Android development.
Try to understand if coffee is forgotten only using the binary output of Muki - it is answering to query or not i.e. the battery is dead.
Drinking too much coffee for testing purposes.

                <p>
                    Estimating the event of forgotten coffee in the mug, the precision could be much better if mug had some feedback, but we used what we got.

                <p>
                    Muki should improve their functionality with more feedback from the mug, then this application would be really trivial to implement, and from talking with people at Junction, forgetting about coffee until it's cold is a thing nowadays.
