                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to have problems remembering physics formulae when studying for exams when I was just starting to learn physics, and so I thought that this skill might help budding young physicists when they are doing homework or generally trying to study physics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives many formulae that are useful when solving basic problems in physics. Upon asking for a formula, Alexa gives a clear and concise description of the formula in such a way that is suitable for younger children to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Amazon Alexa Skill Builder to devise most of the sample utterances and the main slot. I then used AWS Cloud9 to code the skill. I understand that younger children may have problems with pronouncing many of the terms that are used in physics, so I used fuse.js in order to allow Alexa to be lenient with the pronounciation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill failed testing on many occasions due to issues with integrating the fuse.js package with the rest of the code. However, this was swiftly dealt with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did finally manage to make the fuse.js package work. This is the first time I have used fuse.js and so I was very happy that I managed to make it work and on the whole it made my project more user-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As previously discussed, I learned how to use fuse.js. I also learned more about localisation of Alexa based on languages. As a result, this skill is set to be available in five different localisations of English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Physics Formulae
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I hope to be able to continue to expand the database of formulae. I also hope to code this skill in Japanese and German locales to increase international availability.
