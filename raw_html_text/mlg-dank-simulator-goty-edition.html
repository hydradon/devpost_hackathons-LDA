                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build the dankest text-based adventure game to allow our audience to experience the skill needed to rescue a race, and one day, use it to their advantage to save the dankest meme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are placed in a randomly generated dungeon trying to level up to beat the ultimate Illuminati leader. Simulations include a built-in difficulty level set by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a C++ editor, a lot of time, food, and caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with bracket placements along with many syntax errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of our health point and leveling system. I am also proud of our game's ability to randomly generate a dungeon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how similar C++ is to Java. I also learned a little C++.
                </p>

                    What's next for MLG Dank Simulator GOTY Edition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be able to make a functional GUI version along with many other bug fixes.
