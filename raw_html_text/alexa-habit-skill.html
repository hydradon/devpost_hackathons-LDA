                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's fast moving world, where parents don't get enough time to spend time with their children focusing on very small details about their habits. 
So it becomes difficult to teach them those small but crucial good habits and manners. 
Most of the time children follow what they see/hear from others which makes them vulnerable to follow bad(or not so good) manners. 
It is very important to start teaching manners to children in such a way that they enjoy it theirselves.
The key to teach them good manners is to not only teach them the habit but also the appropriate reason for that habit.
By teaching good habits we intend to create a foundation of strong character.
