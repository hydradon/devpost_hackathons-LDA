                <p>
                    From the Kyber devs:

                    )
"""
One strong advantage of Kyber is that liquidity is already on-chain (tokens and prices are already on the smart contract). Anyone can query the Kyber contract for the expect buy and sell rate, such as 1 or 2 ETH equivalent amount of a token. One can then reconstruct an orderbook with orders extracted from Kyber&rsquo;s liquidity pool. For greater accuracy, consider querying rates from individual reserve contracts instead of Kyber&rsquo;s contract. In any case, let us denote orders extracted from Kyber as on-chain orders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be cool to build a relayer that can combine both 0x&rsquo;s and Kyber&rsquo;s model: there are always on-chain orders relayed from Kyber and users can also create new off-chain orders should they wish to sell/buy at a different price. What&rsquo;s really interesting is how the settlement occurs between a new on-chain order with an existing off-chain order, since it may require interactions between both Kyber and 0x smart contracts.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple webpage that interfaces with the Kyber and 0x smart contracts to find the best price.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a test blockchain locally using truffle and ganache, which had data imported from the 
0x-starter project at
                    <a href="https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project
                    </a>
                    and the
Kyber workshop tutorial at
                    <a href="https://github.com/KyberNetwork/workshop" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/KyberNetwork/workshop
                    </a>
                    . We then made a user interface 
for users to query order books from the two protocols simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We edited examples in the Kyber Network workshop for a basic Relayer smart contract to aggregate 
information from the Kyber Network, and edited examples in the 0x starter-project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kyber - installation issues due to solc version - had to switch between different solidity 
versions in truffle. Error messages when transferring from admin to KyberReserve accounts
not informative.

                <p>
                    Setting up the blockchain with all the smart contracts and accounts from Kyber and 0x for testing.
Getting the web interface up.

                    Gained experience with smart contract development tools - truffle 
Implementation of Kyber, 0x, usefulness of both for smart contract developers.
