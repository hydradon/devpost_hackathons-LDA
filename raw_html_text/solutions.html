                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Troubled youth and gang-related activities are more prevalent now than ever, and it's time we found a solution. Throughout history, a myriad of projects have been created to tackle this issue, however; they constantly encounter troubles related to finding ways to increase awareness for resources available, how to incentivize youth to utilize their solution and meeting the needs of the troubled youth.   After conducting research, we found that the two most influential reasons for youth to join a gang are due to the lack of financial means and a need for a sense of community and fellowship. By taking into consideration all of the aforementioned factors, "Regret" was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to tackle the issue of increased youth gang-related incidents by employing gamification to create parallel simulations of the various crossroads that troubled youth may encounter, in hopes of revealing the effects of their actions without any real-life repercussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout our program, &ldquo;Regret&rdquo;, users will face situations similar to statistically common scenarios, where they will have the opportunity to act and decide their next steps. The user will encounter scenarios where they may face familial complications, financial instability etc.  While having options throughout the game to act, the user can decide between positive and negative options (i.e stealing from stores), decide on educational investments (leaving class), join factions with friends, utilize illegal substances, sell illegal goods, engage in territorial complications, faction brawls, lead a life of Regret.  All of which is uniquely masked by an engaging, unique and enticing storyline and characters. According to their actions, they will be led through a storyline of successions that will ultimately teach them lessons on making the right decisions. By the end of the storyline itself, the user will have a unique set of stats and skills that reflect the previous decisions made while learning the gravity of making negative decisions. As a result, the user will have a unique character in which they can now reshape their life and continue to grow and level up their player. Transitioning into a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, we successfully create a new online community, that spans across various demographic regions and providing everyone with a level playing field.  This community will be developed and marketed such that users feel a sense of belonging and community by being a member of Regret.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Unity to code and create our prototype mainly due to its simplicity.  While none of us had used Unity before, scripts in Unity are coded in C# which is very similar to Java where most of us have experience in.  Alongside online resources, we were able to complete the majority of the game mechanics we needed to provide a working prototype to emulate a situation in which this game could teach a certain lesson while still in itself being fun and disguised as a pure play-for-fun game rather than a play-to-learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Regret
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We seek to develop more aspects of the storyline, game, and characters in order to improve the personal connection to each specific user. In further versions, we will launch across multiple servers, in order to integrate multiplayer aspects and incorporating community involvement. Ultimately, we seek to partner with larger companies to implement their hiring process into a fun and sustainable gaming environment, through unique minigames and skill development tasks to accomplish our goal of reducing youth gang-related activities.
