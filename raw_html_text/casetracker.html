                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of the CourtHack hackathon event, I wanted to create something that would allow users to have a better ability to check the status of legal cases they are involved with without having to contact their lawyers or the courts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes data provided by various courts and allows the user to keep track of the various cases they are involved with. It is useful both for lawyers and citizens. It also notifies users if any changes are picked up.
                </p>
