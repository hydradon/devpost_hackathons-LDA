                    Privacy and security is important around the web because your personal data is out in the open. There are ways of hiding your data, but they are old and sometimes unreliable. Because they are older, many people know how they work and have ways of reversing it to get your data. Having your own encryption service insures security because no one else knows how your data is changed to be different. Only you and the receiver can see your data.
