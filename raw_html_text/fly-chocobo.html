                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took my favorite chocobo plush to the hackathon to cuddle with while coding. As I was brainstorming project ideas, I decided to use the chocobo and put it in a flappy bird-type scenario but add a feature of shooting blocks that block its path.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a bird that flies up against the force of gravity similar to the physics engine of flappy bird.   However, this chocobo can shoot bullets to destroy the blocks.  I had intended to add other chocobos as an obstacle, but time did not permit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I planned my work and tracked my progress in a notebook.
I used HTML5 to display the page with the .js game. I styled the background, alignment, and color of the pages with css. I created two javascript files, node.js and Server.js, to create a local server to display my web application.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a hard time learning how to use javascript; in fact, I ended up spending the time from 1pm-10:30pm learning how to code with javascript using a youtube tutorial of coding tetris.  After, that I started to code Fly Chocobo! and realized that coding everything from scratch with a newbie using javascript was impossible (for me at least).  I decided to scrap any code that i had at 1AM and restarted using a Framework called Phaser. While this helped a lot, I messed up syntax a few times, spending up to an hour to find the mistake (haha whoops).  Because of these setbacks, I couldnt quite reach the point I was hoping to reach.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm excited to leave this hackathon knowing how to work with some knowledge of game development in javascript. After all, I came here to learn something new!  Surprisingly, I was able to have experience with back-end and front-end development.  I managed to create server using node.js for my web app.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to: create a server with node.js, develop games using javascript and phaser, using some html and css.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fly Chocobo!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to make it fully functional and perhaps replace the concept of maneuvering through blocks with fighting against other chocobo vars that randomly appear on the game.
