                <p>
                    Good passwords are hard to remember.  Belts keep your pants up.

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The belt is a usb cable.  Plug it into your computer, press the button, and it will write your password as if you typed it at the keyboard.

                    Hardware is hard!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The belt does not need batteries, does not send your password over the air, and does not need software installed on the computer where you want to type your password.
