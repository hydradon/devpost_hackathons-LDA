                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understand that many people of our world struggle with depression, and we wanted to find ways to help solve this issue. We thought about things that people use in their everyday lives, and we thought about things that we use everyday, and thought about Spotify. We thought about ways to solve the issue with depression through Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks at what you recently have been listening to, and looks at the lyrics of the song to determine whether you are in a happy or negative mood. If it detects that you are in a really negative mood, it will think that you are depressed and will make a playlist that will try to lift your spirits and turn your frown upside down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to read the lyrics and detect whether you were negative or positive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members were really experienced with Swift or XCode, so instead of using an apple app, we had to use python instead. In the amount of time we had, we were unable to implement this idea into a physical app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successful in using machine learning to detect whether a song's lyrics were negative or positive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To manage our time better in a 12 hour hackathon. We should also come more prepared and be prepared as a group.
