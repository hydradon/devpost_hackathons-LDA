                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to WHO, in some developing countries, up to 30 per cent of all medicine is counterfeit. As a reason, 200000 children dies from malaria and pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa every year. 38 people died in the Czech Republic during the 2012 Methanol Affair, which could have been prevented by better logistic logs. In 2018, 75% of products in Czech Farmers market did not fulfil State requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PharmaTrust logs production, transportation and distribution details of goods on the blockchain. We have used blockchain because it provides immutability and is tamper-proof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    200,000 kids die yearly (WHO) due to taking counterfeit medicine (against malaria, pneumonia).
In developing regions, up to 30% drugs are fake (WHO).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution brings the lost profits back to the companies (up to 30%) and increases the trust in the company activities. Furthermore, it eliminates black market and its possible fatal consequences. Brand is not the product you sell, brand is the collection of emotions, beliefs and mainly trust.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it on the Ethereum network using the Solidity language to write the smart contract that stores the records. We have also used JavaScript and React.JS to write the frontend that users can access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidity is a very challenging language to write in.
As Truffle framework a new platform, it still contains some bugs.
There were some business challenges that we had to address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team had no prior experience with the Ethereum platform and the Solidity language and we were able to implement basic functionality of the smart contract. We have managed to invent a solution with a real impact that adds value to company's products at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Solidity, EU drug regulations, business- and area-specific knowledge.
