                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As 19- and 20- year olds, this is the first Presidential election in which we will be voting, and it also happens to be one of the most chaotic (yet entertaining) elections in America's recent history. Sometimes it's easy to become fearful of the future and the consequences of who the nation chooses as a leader. But we realized that it's possible to make light of this situation regardless of how daunting it may seem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trump is trying to build his wall and its up to you to stop him! He's dropping blocks of the wall down from above, but if you place blocks of the same color next to each other, you earn points and take money from Donald Trump!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS and Swift programming language to build the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to build a game similar to Tetris and Bejeweled, where three or more adjacent blocks of the same color would explode and destroy Trump's wall (We also wanted a Bernie Sanders power up that blew up two rows of blocks). Unfortunately, due to time constraints and technical issues we were unable to complete these goals (yet!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team had very little knowledge of Swift and iOS development prior to HackNY. After 24 hours, we are proud to say that we have learned a great deal about both iOS programming and algorithms, and how closely related they are to the concepts we've learned in Computer Science courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also reminded us of how much you can build in such a short amount of time, and how much
                    <em>
                        more
                    </em>
                    you can build if you had more time.
                </p>

                    What's next for YUGE!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT'S GONNA BE YUGE
                </p>
                <p>
                    But seriously, we want to definitely accomplish our original goals and hopefully publish it in the near future.
