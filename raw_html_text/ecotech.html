                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reduces paper waste, transferring receipts from the useless paper format, to a digital format the user has access to, on a mobile app.  It also helps users keep track of their expenses, get useful suggestions and ultimately make their life users. For the companies, it will help them understand their costumers better, by keeping track of who bought what. In the end, it's a solution that helps the environment, the individual users and the companies, all-in-one.
