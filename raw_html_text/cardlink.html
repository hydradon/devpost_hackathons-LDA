                    Trello is the perfect tool for planning everything from you product launch plan to your dream vacation. However, with any project or plan there are always subtasks or related activities that should be grouped together. Now with one click, you can enable bilateral linking within a Trello board to create and identify parent and child cards with ease. Set up and onboarding in under one minute!
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main technical challenges we had during the project were mainly related to the fact that none of us had any prior experience developing Trello Power Ups. Basically we started from the very beginning doing the Hello World tutorial. We had to spend time analyzing the Trello APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to kind of rethink the normal development process we normally use in Adaptavist (one repo and different git branches), due to the fact that we needed a server hosting all of our front-end code. To do that each of us had to fork their own personal copy of the main repository. We then used those to host code for dev testing purposes. The main repository was where we hosted and stored stable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figuring out what type of module we should use to display the links was tricky. There is no module for adding a general panel to the Trello card, so we spent some time choosing a solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the APIs to store data on the cards were limited at the time and didn't allow us to do operations on different cards and boards. During the Connect Week in Austin, talking to the guys from Trello, we were informed that these API are about to be more powerful, what is really good news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very easy to start building power ups for Trello. The documentation is comprehensive and it is possible to start developing even without a backend or any remote services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CardLink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In true agile fashion, we're releasing V1 for Codegiest with plans to grow the Power-up's functionality in the months to come. We're looking for user feedback to find ways we can provide more value and help users truly harness the power of creating relationships in Trello.
