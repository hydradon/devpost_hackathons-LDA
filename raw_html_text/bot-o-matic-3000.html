                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this hackathon, we never really worked on building a bot for a game. We thought it would be an interesting challenge to work on during GUH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot play the game MS Tanks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time Constraint. We had different ideas, and it took a while to settle on one.
Latency with the server impaired the precision required for the target tracking function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a mathematical model to hit moving targets on both straight and curved trajectories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning isn't always the answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bot-o-matic 3000
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us would like to use machine-learning to make it better.
