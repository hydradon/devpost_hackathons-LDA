                        People's attitude about food waste
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day we saw a friend sitting beside us in our college mess throwing almost the entire plate of food. When we asked whether he thought anything before throwing the food, he laughed it off. After listening to him we realized how ignorant and indifferent people are towards the act of throwing away food. This compelled us to do something about the issue and hence we decided to solve this problem.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we know
                    <strong>
                        We can control what we can measure
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we have built a unique web dashboard which provides:
&bull; Quantitative measurement of the environmental impacts (food, water, CO2 and calories) of food wasted by the user
&bull; Analyzing the user&rsquo;s wastage data and depicting it through graphs and ranks.
&bull; Instant mail post dining intimating the user about the food they wasted and its impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end goal is to make users reduce their wastage.
                </p>
