                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration is a series of dreams I've been having over the past few weeks, coupled with the fact that every personality quiz I've ever taken has involved self-description instead of action. So I thought that by having your actions influence the test itself, it'd be a far more engaging experience than a standard self-descriptive quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an interactive story where you provide your details and make choices that affect the storyline. As you work through the story, your decisions help provide information for a Myers-Briggs framework that runs in the background and at the end, it will analyze and provide an answer for your Myers-Briggs type, in addition to imparting a valuable theme depending on your actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python. I started off by creating the framework for the Myers-Briggs test by setting certain values to trigger at certain points based on certain dilemmas. Every dilemma was based on scenarios from a Myers-Briggs test I found. I changed the situations from theoretical self-description to active situational decision-making to ensure a more accurate reading. People are notoriously bad at self-description and very good at taking action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues with integrating integer and string inputs into my existing framework for processing inputs. 
There was also the slight issue that I have basically no experience coding so I had to learn a bunch of stuff on the fly, so I improved my protocols for handling decision-making events over the course of the programming experience. I also found that my grammatical abilities degraded as my programming abilities improved, so I required playtesting to catch issues with my writing.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to write more chapters for the middle parts to get a more accurate Myers-Briggs test reading so I prevent any cases where the program can't figure out a player's Myers-Briggs designation.
I also want to add more morality and subjective readings so that way people get more details beyond Myers-Briggs. Descriptors like sympathetic or utilitarian would help people feel that it reads them better, and I want to make a title generator based on their actions and achievements.
