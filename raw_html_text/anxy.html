                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our project came from both of our recent years experiencing anxiety. We thought this technique of identifying stressors and slowly working on them was a good way to relieve anxiety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anxy is a web app that aims helps individuals struggling with any level of anxiety by jotting down their stressors of the day, what category it belongs in, and how they plan to resolve it. It will help promote healthy self-reflection and practice them in thinking of how to ease their anxiety, one stressor, one goal at a time. In addition, it has a statistical functionality, showing the user what category caused them most anxiety per week or month so they can have a holistic view of what stresses them out the most, and be more cognisant of what to be aware of and work on.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Docker for MySQL and Flask. We built a RESTful API in plain Flask with an Angular.js and Boostrap front end. We built the front and back end separately, and connected them together afterwards.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting the front and back end and handling dependencies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud to have started on a project that means a lot to us, as well as go out of our comfort zone to sacrifice rest to accelerate our learning. We hope this project is something that could help others in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that connecting front and back end is no easy task. We also learned a lot from each other about front and back end, respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for anxy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that anxy could take off and can be something that can help others with their anxiety or other mental issues. Otherwise, we are excited to work on it on our own after the hackathon because we're confident we can make it into something great and something to be even more proud of
