                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project to help our local community (Baltimore)
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website that creates a platform for users to interact and to create and join community clean up projects to make Baltimore cleaner and greener.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML5, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS to create this webpage. I also created a database to store data with firebase.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I struggled creating a database with firebase. Also, making the webpages optimal for many different browsers posed a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to make a professional looking website.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about creating databases with firebase and more about bootstrap
                </p>

                    What's next for Beautifying Baltimore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to connect this organization with a club in my school called 23:59, a club focused on beautifying our community and helping humanitarian crises. This club organizes beautification projects for the community, however with my help, they will be able to get more people to participate through an online platform. I can slowly expand this to other users on the internet in Baltimore and and make it cleaner and greener.
