                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As immigrants, we feel obligated to help people who are struggling to catch up to their peers, specifically children with autism.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ADSLinks website is a series of web pages that exercise certain skills that a child with autism might struggle with so they can be the best version of themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, we curated many different activities that are efficient in improving a certain skill and then wove those activities together into one beautiful interface for people to access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an interactive experience where it engages, yet improves ones skills was a major challenge for us. Also, connecting and organizing all the web pages into one cohesive website was a major difficulty as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about web design, while also learning more about our cause, allowing us to grow more as not only programmers, but as people as well. We also learned to work more collaboratively in groups, which is a necessity for our future careers.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of trying to setup an actual website, and add more complex algorithms to better suite its users.
