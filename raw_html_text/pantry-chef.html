                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking at my pantry at around lunchtime and didn't know what to make and didn't want to go shopping. I wanted there to be a way so I don't have to look around online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user hits the list button and adds in everything in there pantry and fridge. The app runs through all meals and there ingredients and displays what you can make at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT App Inventor and GIMP 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few limitations to using MIT App Inventor, primarily that AI does not have object-oriented programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving a good looking UI in addition to having a functional (if not fully) demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use MIT App Inventor and further knowledge of block programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pantry Chef
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to stay in touch and finishing the app, as well as some aesthetic polishing, and eventually selling it on the app store for everyone to have.
