                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a formerly incarcerated person, advocate and service worker for the formerly incarcerated I am acutely aware of the needs that go unmet everyday for people like me. Over the last 4 years, I have learned to code under the belief that technology can meet many of these needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obodo is a complete ecosystem of support that includes national, local and academic resources directories, an online learning platform, and a social network to tie it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were so many challenges! Really, the biggest though was finding some sense of work family balance during the entire building process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire site is really close to exactly what I had envisioned. I'm really proud of myself and the entire process I wen through to make this a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deadlines are vital to accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Obodo - Find, Learn, Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    World domination!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What that looks like - Developing partnerships around the country to implement the platform in their agencies and develop new learning modules, refine and enhance the resource directories and develop the user base to include as many diverse people as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, an android and IOS app would be a nice addition to streamline the interface for mobile device users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development of an API so that organizations can link the activities of their clients to their CRM systems and streamline the data management process and increase efficacy.
