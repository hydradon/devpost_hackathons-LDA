                    None of the four of us knew how to code.
That's why we created Bit by Bit, a website that contains a plethora of sites that you can use to start coding. As we learned through our suggested websites, we were able to build our project. We strive to help other newcomers quickly and easily find their way around the world of coding, while we hopefully improve along with them.
Bit by Bit is made up of a group of beginner coders who struggled finding the right reasons for them.

                    What it does
Bit by Bit is made up of a group of beginner coders who struggled finding the right reasons for them. That's why we wanted to create Bit by Bit, a website platform, where beginner coders can find easy resources and have a more organized process towards learning how to code.
