                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website using javascript, css and HTML. We used node.js for the backend. We scrapped ricardo's website for recipes, and we used google spreadsheet as a no-sql database, we used heroku to host our server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -There were no free recipe database and we needed to scrape data from ricardocuisine.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -We also had difficulty making our algorithm to match ingredients
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a near future, we would like to add a preferences functionality and a map with all the grocery stores near your location using the GPS in cellphone. These functionalities will make the user experience better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to make a hybrid based mobile app that could run on android and ios.
