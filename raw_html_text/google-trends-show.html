                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re big fans of board games and local coop games. We took a game made by the YouTube channel Funhaus and automated the job of the moderator so everyone can play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives the players a word and working on their own or with a group, they have to compete to find the more commonly searched related word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a client and server that could handle multiple concurrent games with varying amounts of players. We did this with HTML, js, and jsp. We used a python api to get the data from the Google Trends API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Google Trend data was difficult, there is no publicly available official API and many unofficially ones were outdated and broken.
Early in the morning, some strings would just disappear as they got modified. We eventually realized it was some weird character we got when reading from a file. We ended up just trimming it off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game that&rsquo;s fun and easy to pick up and play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got better at working with clients and servers and using the tool that are required for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Google-Trends-Show
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some features we had to leave out, like a more advanced team system, and scraping Reddit for currently popular terms related to different subjects.
