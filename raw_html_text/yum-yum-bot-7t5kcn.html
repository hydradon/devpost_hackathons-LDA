                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have witnessed the difficulty of ordering food for our lunch which requires us to install an application or browse through a plethora of websites which is time-consuming and inconvenient. Recently, people spend so much time on messaging app, this bot will enable them to order food through message as if you are talking to one of your friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through easy interactive messages, this bot can take order of the delicious food from the list of lunch menus and deliver the food  at your doorstep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used api.ai for the natural language processing, facebook messanger bot for the front end, mongodb for the database, and nodejs for the backend of the webserver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design of stages for the successful and smooth implementation of the bot and the different design aspect of the bot such as the attractive and interactive option. It required long hour of training the api  to bring the yum yum down to human level communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to build the yum yum within two days that is so smooth in the interaction that most of the company lack. This alternative and better method to order food quickly and easily which is currently at nascent stage will gain its momentum and accelerate. We are proud to be the group who have created this.
                </p>
