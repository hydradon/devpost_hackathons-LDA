                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we decided to start with a game of Sudoku and made an algorithm to solve it. After that, the whole project sprung off to be an interface of playable games that can be solved my algorithms if you aren't able to. The interface includes Hangman, Sudoku, Anagrams, and Mastermind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we have a client that you can select a game to play through the console and it automatically starts running. we attempted to create a web interface to pair with the games, but ran out of time. There is basic html for formatting of the website but the access keys restrict us from accessing the domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we created all of the games from scratch programming their rules to make the framework of each game, then we created an interactive part for each so that you can play the games, and finally an algorithm so solve them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lack of prior experience with domain development really slowed the project on the front-end and thus there is not a complete web build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were able to create algorithms to solve all the games and the hardest one by far was Sudoku because of all the variables that need to be accounted for and edge cases.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    don't wait till the last four hours to start making a GUI, especially if you don't have lots of experience with html
                </p>

                <p>
                    we will attempt to get the site working and enhance the GUI so the site is fun and interactive.
