                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted a copy of my notes on my mobile device. I thought about how I could be able to do this. Then I thought Markdown would be the best way to parse typed and handwritten notes into a visually pleasing format on a mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS application parses text written in Markdown and formats and visualizes it onto a native iOS application. The text can be either typed or handwritten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Tesseract's OCR technology to parse text from images, and the iOS app was written in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing the text from Markdown to a format that I needed was the most difficult part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to get some of the attributes of Markdown and translating them to UIKit elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that text parsing is very difficult, and OCR technology is still not up to par.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Markdown for iOS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open sourcing the translations made in this app to ultimately format native iOS applications by just writing in Markdown.
                </p>
