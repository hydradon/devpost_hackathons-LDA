                    can explain their code to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck, to work out logic and debug.
As computer science majors with backgrounds in theatre, we felt the need to tie together these two disparate,
                    <em>
                        yet oddly similar,
                    </em>
                    worlds. In addition, SoliloQuack is a tool that is completely unheard of, yet needed, for both actors and directors alike.

                <p>
                    You begin by adding your script, and then reading it to your microphone. Then, our web app will help you learn by showing both the percentage of correct words out of the practiced section and what words you missed. We look forward to enhance this main functionality, by warning users of synonyms they have confused with the script. This will make you the star actor for any picky - we mean artistic - director!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner and I began by complaining about the difficulties of rehearsing alone, how we wished it existed in past experiences, and just had to get to work fixing it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to find the most suitable speech-to-text api, and this presented our group with many struggles. We plan on researching all of our options further, and making our web app as accurate as it can!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was one of our first experiences with Javascript, JQuery, and api's in general, so that original intimidation was hard to overcome. However, we did not want to give up on this project no matter what, and still see it as something really helpful for people. We are proud of organizing and finding the best path, even if it was difficult. -Isabelle

                    I had attempted HTML before, but could never get it to look good and be functional. However, this project really taught me the fundamentals of combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript among other useful things such as Bootstrap and JQuery. I'm very proud of the fact that many of my theater friends will actually be able to use the website to rehearse as it is functional! I also created a logo for it that I really liked. -Kamile

                    The skills that we learned completely new this weekend are:

                    We have many more theatre needs we are thrilled to work on! Some of them include
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dialogs: The actor can do scenes with as many actors as they need, and our web app will play the other parts!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accents: We look to detect and give suggestions for the actors' accents and the specific play they are performing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stage Directions: The uses of our web app can extend to working with your crew as well, to read the important stage directions. In this way the actors can stay focussed on the material!
