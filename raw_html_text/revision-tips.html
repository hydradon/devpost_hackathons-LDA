                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have recently had exams and I feel that I would have benefited greatly from some tips. I picked up a few along the way and so I thought that making this skill would help others with their revision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon asking it for a tip, the skill outputs a random tip from a database of tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used AWS Lambda in conjunction with Alexa Skills Kit. I used previous knowledge of random fact skills to help me to code the random fact generator. I then entered tips from a range of resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some trouble with finding useful tips, however overall this skill did not prove to be much of a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to create my random fact generator so efficiently. I feel that having done this a few times I am now very efficient with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of looking for tips, I learned a few tips that I did not know before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Revision Tips
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue to add tips for revision in future updates. If the skill proves to be popular, I will start adding subject specific tips.
