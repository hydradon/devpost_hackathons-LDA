                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly 40 percent of food produced by America is never eaten, which leads to a high percentage of food waste. The economic, food insecurity, and sustainability implications necessitate a solution that can ensure higher retention of food ending up in consumers&rsquo; hands. Due to the current lack of efficient methods to limit the exorbitant amount of food wasted, 160 billion pounds of wasted food end up in our landfills. The food waste issue is exacerbated by how food products often expire and are discarded before consumers have the chance to buy the product. Therefore, there is a dire need for a solution to battle limited shelf-life and lack of connection between the excess supply and demand for food.

                    Allot is a platform for individuals ranging from growers to supermarket owners to everyday individuals who have excess food supply/products to directly reach consumers in search of their next affordable meal. By managing payments and logistics, streamlining the process in which owners of excess food reach their customers, and increasing customer retention while promoting brand awareness, Allot benefits both the producers and consumers of food. By approaching the issue of food waste from a standpoint that emphasizes food that has already been produced , this efficient business model is able to decrease the amount of uneaten food that ends up in landfills while satisfying the increasing need for affordable groceries.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Allot by using ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB for the backend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into time-constraints but were able to pool our resources, allocate team responsibilities based upon each member's strengths, and push through to finish our hack.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of increasing awareness about food waste, completing our project by the deadline, and getting a decent amount of sleep last night!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that waste management business models have exorbitant potential in limiting waste from the moment crops are produced on farms to the moment they reach supermarket shelves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Allot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allot will be expanded to decrease not only the waste of food close to expiration dates, but will also decrease food waste at the sites of farmers and growers.
