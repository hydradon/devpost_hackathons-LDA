                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the IPCC, the world will see catastrophic effects if temperatures climb to 2 degrees over current levels. This news is extremely distressing and the task of saving the earth is certainly not a small task. We feel that the only way to get there is if more individuals make a conscious effort to take on more eco-friendly choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application allows users to search and view products that they want to buy, but what makes this different from any other e-commerce site is that we nudge consumer towards making a more environment-friendly choice. We rank products based on relevance but also on their eco-friendliness based on carbon emissions of the materials they're made of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ebay API to retrieve relevant products and information on their materials. Given this information, we trained a machine learning classifier that gives a score that determines how eco-friendly a product is based on multiple factors such as material, title and description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was training the model given that there was a limited amount of training data available for eco-friendly products. We also had to do a lot of research on the carbon emissions of different materials and assess their eco-friendliness levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great learning experience for all of us, particularly in the field of environment science which was something we weren't previously familiar with. Also, we learned a lot from each other and probably laughed too much
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deal with integrating different sources of information and finding meaningful insights. We also realized how large the effects are of even the smallest purchases!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eCO2Seek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to train our model on a larger data set and see how well it can do with even more products
