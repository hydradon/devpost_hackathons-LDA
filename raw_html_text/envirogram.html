                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current President has said on record that he wants to cut funding for environmental programs, global warming is a hoax and he left the paris climate deal. Environmental concerns are huge issues that are often overlooked. I want my kids children to be able to live on earth and the likelyhood of that happening decreases everyday.

                <p>
                    Millenials in this day and age lives revolve around social media. We decided to create a social media platform that promotes helping the environment. Simply create an account upload images to your feed and earn points called "envirocoins." These envirocoins can be spent for prizes that companys trying to better than socioeconomic status can donate to. We have an adroid app called envirogram with a feed leader board and profile capabilities. We also have a fully developed, hosted website where you can learn about our mission or donate to the company.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the android app and implemented an API called Firebase. Firebase was pivotal in storing our users information and authenticating them. We used html/css and bootstrap to create the website. We hosted the website through GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had numerous problems working around extremely slow wifi and having issues with GitHub and the code pushing process. On average with the application it would take 7 minutes to send code back and forth and made us really inefficient. We weren't able to install a compiler to work on the html text editor 'sublime' so for the website so we had to work on the code without being able to compile it and we had to fix errors manually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ive made websites in the past but typically over a span of multiple days. being able to complete a fully functional hosted website and an android app in a span of 11 ish hours was very surprising to us and we were happy. We also felt accomplished being able to successfully implement firebase something we havent had sucsess with in the past due to the difficulty of the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had to do it again we would promptly make sure that our text editors and applications were fully installed and working. We also would've became more familiar with GitHub beforehand. We learned how to successfully implement firebase.
                </p>

                    What's next for Envirogram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would want to transition into more drastic changes involving trying to prevent global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer.
