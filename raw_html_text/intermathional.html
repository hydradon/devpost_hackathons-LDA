                    How it Started
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we started the hackathon, we were pretty new to mobile app development, so we decided that a good challenge would be to see if we could build our first (and meaningful) mobile app, choosing iOS as our platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some brainstorming, we decided that a fairly small and simple app would be best for a 23-hour hackathon, so we decided to go with an educational app for children. We planned it as a simple math app with a bit of twist: the questions could be presented in multiple languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I/We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Swift and Xcode programming, and about mockup &amp; prototyping tools for mobile applications, courtesy of the mentors teaching the workshops we attended, and from our own time spent working on the project.
