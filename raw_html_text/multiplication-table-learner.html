                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game that is educational.  Multiplication facts is something everyone needs to learn and is suitable for the right age group.  I also love math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will either tell you math facts or quiz you on specific tables.  This is helpful for kids in school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python to build my lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulty understanding what was passed from Amazon to the lambda function at first, but once I understood attributes, it was easy.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of making my first Alexa sill.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do not have a lot of app/skill coding experience so it was nice to be able to develop this skill
                </p>

                    What's next for Multiplication table learner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to make a 2 player mode where you race your friend to see who can answer quicker.  I'd also like to add a shot clock to help speed up recognition.  If I can figure out how to interface with Alexa better.
