                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I watch tv shows and movies a lot on my desktop PC at night and I don't really want to disturb my roommates. My desktop PC does not have a bluetooth card. So I came up with the idea of using my android phone to act as an audio receiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project includes both the audio stream that records the sound playing on the computer and the receive which receive the audio and play it back through a pair of earphones or headphones of choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android studio to create the phone interface. I use java swing to build the desktop streamer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took me 2 hours to learn there isn't a way to record the sound output directly from the sound card. I eventually had to download a third-party virtual audio device to fake act as an output device then loop it back to the recording device.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that the impossibility of recording the audio using Java did not let me down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know how to use sockets, audio stream better now.
                </p>

                    What's next for Airdio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will build a more robust version of the streamer using C# and Windows API. This way I don't have to go through the hacky way of using the virtual loop back device.
