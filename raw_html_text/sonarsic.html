                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today it's really hard to have a clear central place to find more about an Artist.
It's either an ugly, hyperlink-packed bio wiki, a song on Spotify, or a series of supposedly related artists (on some black box criteria).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to aggregate all the music - artist related -  meta data and bring unique insights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dynamic web application with unique insights about an artist : events, lyrics, fan location, past collaborations, etc.
We worked on the backend to get the data from the Headliners of Les Ardentes 2018 (around 10 artists).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Build it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We built the data pipeline in Python,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use PowerBI as an Iframe,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Packaged everything with Vue.js
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We used around 6 different APIs (lyrics, events, social networks, etc).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were greedy in terms of data sources and spent a lot of time for the cleansing. Free data API's are plagued with dubious data quality and stringent query limits. Also there are way too many things that are interesting. Staying focussed on a very simple access to information - while keeping rich and explorable content - was tricky in those circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We knew we would have to make choices, but it was unexpectedly hard to make them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a final dashboard and
                    <strong>
                        ONLINE
                    </strong>
                    and available to everyone (sonarsic.com)! We didn't expect to use powerBI - but it turned out to be a good choice (if a limiting one). We though first to use Dash (from plotly) or directly a JS framework. But as we are not front-end/UX guys, we would have not something finished. So basically we got the backend ready, and we did some clicks (a lot actually ;-)) for the front-end.
                </p>

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get to know about api regarding music/artist data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cloudinary : great tool for cdn. Easy to use !!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vuetifyjs - As we needed a iframe container and quick web app for our powerBI dashboard.

                <p>
                    Get customer feedback ! Improve it !

                <p>
                    We already have plenty of ideas we just didn't have the time to render. Here are a few
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add a catchier header with a more dynamic artist selection mechanism (e.g. swipe)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graphic art universe
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sentiment of lyrics (positive/negative/ironic/... songwriter)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Summary of track sound analysis (repetetivness, dominant chords progression, ...)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    and of course we need at least a few hyperlinks and sound snippets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backend side we did some interesting work that can be refactoring so that we can really - on the fly - get the data from a given artist.
