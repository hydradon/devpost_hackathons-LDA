                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My step-mother suffers from Fibromyalgia. She has found it hard to keep track of her symptom flares along with the treatment option she follows. Moreover, the options available are not well researched like many others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Argove uses responsive forms and databases to keep track of people's symptoms/emotions/feelings. Moreover, people can add their prescription medications or treatment options to extend the focus of the data.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Laravel Framework
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    ( PHP ) to build the backend. I used CSS,HTML and bootstrap framework to build the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Axios for asynchronous data interpolation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on both the backend, the frontend, and the creative design independently over the last days has been exhilarating. Even though I don't have a working project at the moment, I do have a better understanding of the components I have put together and I intend to finish this in the foreseeable future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is semi-doable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Argove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to take this platform one step further and integrate it with iodine.com API. Moreover, I plan to incorporate native mobile apps, wearable devices, and smart home devices to gather as much data as possible to build a powerful research focussed database. The data can be used by doctors, health institutions, and research institutions to reduce healthcare costs, and understand human discomfort. The application use cases extend to vast categories in the health industry.
