                <p>
                    Traffic is a major problem that affects every person in the city. Being stuck in traffic unexpectedly is one of the worst feelings that you can have, even more so considering that you could avoid many jams with the help of some research. Time Map provides you with this information at the tip of your fingers.

                <p>
                    In addition to this, another common problem that many drivers face that affects traffic as well is finding parking spaces when attending crowded events such as concerts, conventions, etc. It would be great to have sensors everywhere that tell us information all the time. However, doing so is not a feasible solution and would be very expensive and hard to maintain. Enter Time Map, with its crowd sourced parking status feature it aims to take care of this issue and help reduce search wait times and in doing so reducing traffic as well.

                    This app makes an educated guess to what traffic will be like based on both the past and the future. It uses publicly available data sets from past events as well as from upcoming events to determine this.
Our solution involves giving opportunity to the homeless community by allowing them to participate in crowd sourcing. This way they can provide up to date information to drivers and receive a tip for contributing. Drivers can now spend less time searching for a parking space. It's a win-win situation.

                    Nobody likes being in traffic. After doing some research about the factors that contribute to traffic we concluded that some of these are repeating events and might even be recorded ahead of time. Think about it, a music concert happening the next week for big musician such as Paul McCartney in downtown is clearly going to generate a lot of traffic; a lot of people will be driving to the event (or riding an uber), parking will be hard to find, and so on. Well, it turns out that most of these events are planned way ahead of time and this type of information is available to the public. Now, if we expand on this concept, we could take a look at more information than just music concerts but any type of event with high attendance. We could also take a look at weather forecasts, traffic accidents, and so on. With all of this in mind Time Map is able to provide better directions.

                    Traffic is a huge problem that any city will face at some point or another. Traffic jams are caused due to a several number of factors which can be used to in some cases to reduce traffic or to alert upcoming drivers to take alternative routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some factors that might be the cause of traffic jams can be recurring events such as: the time of the day, public and private events (concerts, conventions, etc) that have high attendance, weather, traffic accidents, road maintenance, public and private transportation entities, parking and so on. In this day and age a lot of these factors can be known well in advanced (such as music concerts) or be predicted with past traffic behavior. Making use of several APIs for upcoming events, weather status, traffic updates, and others Time Map can make educated guesses and provide the best route for drivers.
