                    SnapAHotel uses Android Wear to find nearby hotels. With a simple snap, an individual can find the 50 nearest hotel rooms.

                    We utilized the Amadeus API and Android-Studio to develop the app.

                <h2>
                    Extracting the right data from Amadeus to fit on the watch was a challenge and getting the gestures on the watch to work was a challenge.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'm proud that we were able to learn so much from a simple idea and have an idea for a unique app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned that using gestures and API data is very particular and can lead to a lot of errors.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    SnapAHotel is a start to easier travel. Adding onto the application will allow users to find nearby activities, taxis, and other useful travel items with simple hand gestures.
