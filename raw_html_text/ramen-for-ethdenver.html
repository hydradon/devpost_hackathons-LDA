after playing with CryptoKitties or just all the calories that you might burn while you try to trading with crypto using exchanges or simply because you're a developer and you need to feed yourself time to time. Here are some inspiring quotes around ramen:

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The only men I need is Ramen - Anonymous
Ramen is a dish that's very high in calories and sodium. One way to make it slightly healthier is to leave the soup and just eat the noodles. &ndash; Masaharu Morimoto

                <p>
                    Unlike other ERC721 collectibles, in Ramen-Ya not all the collectibles are immediately transferable: it will only be possible to sell or consume once a "Ramen" bowl (noodles + soup + topping) has been cooked. Bowls (noodles + soup) can be transferred, but as Bowls do not profit from the potential level of umami (from Japanese, level of savoriness) the value of it is limited. Ingredients cannot be transferred, they can only be combined to form Bowls.

                <p>
                    Here are explained some particularities of this game's system.

                    Ingredients
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Initia ingredients in RamenYa come to existance when farmers from around to world havest them. This event depends on many factors, such as time, season, because it 
would not be sustainable otherwise and we would force farmers to opt unsustainable methods that would harm the planed unnecessarily.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Ingredient characteristics
                </h4>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>struct Ingredient {
                                // unique stock keeping unit

                <p>
                    The characteristics are determined in combination of a pseudrandomly generated 2-digits number and some hard coded ranges that determine the likelihood of each characteristic appearing. For example, if number is truly random, there's 69% of chance that it will have level 1 in Flavour Depth and 1% of likelihood for level 4.

                    Ingredients cannot be directly transfered, they can only be combined to form Bowls (and only type noodles and broth can be combined at this stage). The properties of the ingredients used will influence in the final Ramen's umami.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Bowls
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Bowls are unique combinations of pairs of unique ingredients (where one must be noodles and the other one must be broth). Each bowl needs 30 minutes of preparation and they are transferrable. The only way of owning Bowls is either by combining ingredients yourself or by acquiring it at the Kitchen (where you can find all the bowls that are ready and check their properties).

                <p>
                    Ramen are the combination of a unique Bowl and a unique ingredient (of type topping). The main rule here is that the bowl must have been acquired from the kitchen: another player has prepared the bowl for you. Once acquired, you can choose what topping to add and enjoy Ramen in its true form.

                <p>
                    Note: for the sake of simplicity, Ramen in RamenYa are composed of 3 main ingredients (noodles, broth, topping), but in real life they should have

                    Once Ramen has been formed, meaning that you bought a browl and added a topping, this unique ramen becomes transferrable. A buyer pays an amount of ETH or RamenCoin for your Ramen, which later on can be consumed. Once a ramen is consumed, there are two things that will happen: you'll feel the warmth in your stomach and a new ingredient will spawn from it, which later on you can use to play again. This new ingredient's properties will depend on the Ramen's umamiLevel:

                    As tribute to the producers of my learning content and (personal) continuous learning of smart contract development, there 
will be interfaces with existing ERC721 tokens. The idea is that, e.g., if ramen is delivered to Kitties, the Kitty will give you in return certain ingredients (freshly caught birds, fish, etc). And who knows, maybe if you feed the same kitty many times, the kitty wants to stay with you? (☆▽☆)
