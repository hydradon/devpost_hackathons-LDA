                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Recent Nepal Earthquake has shown us the need for a more effective method for first responders to locate people in distress and co-ordinate rescue efforts effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have implemented a novel algorithm to access the user's threat level and predict whether the user is distress or not. Usually, in times of natural calamities; the GSM networks breakdown. The app turns Victim's phone into a beacon for the emergency services to quickly locate him using the phone's Low energy Bluetooth, as well as Ultrasound.
