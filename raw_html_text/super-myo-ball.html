                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration was trying to mix interesting hardware and intuitive gameplay. We are trying to win best hack by first time hackers, organizers choice, or the overall best hack. We wanted to make something fun while having fun doing it. We also wanted to learn new skills at the hackathon. This was our first interaction with C#, unity, and the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a Myo controller to manipulate the orientation of a plane to move a ball across a level. There are multiple levels, unique challenges, and custom music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built in Unity along with the Myo SDK. This involved writing scripts in C#/javascript and using the unity interface for level design. Music for the game was created using SonicPi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was setting up and creating gameplay that feels good with the Myo. We had to design a system that takes 3D movement by the player and creates something enjoyable. This involved a lot of play testing and bringing in other hackers to try out our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gameplay with the Myo, music, and level design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the unity engine and writing scripts, primarily in C# but with some javascript as well. We also took a lot away from working with the Myo and it's SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Myo Ball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future Super Myo Ball can be easily expanded upon. What will come next is new mechanics and levels.
                </p>
