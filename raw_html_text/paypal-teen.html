                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that PayPal had a College Debit card that went inactive. Why was this? It was difficult to monitor the amount of money transferred between accounts. We wondered how this issue could be addressed and how we could tap into an untouched customer base. Then it hit us: PayPal Teen. We wanted to enable teens to access PayPal's purchasing platform by creating a PayPal Teen button for online purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once the button is clicked, a notification is sent to their parents through the PayPal app (if they have it downloaded) or through SMS. The notification tells the parent what item their teen is looking to buy and gives the option to approve or deny the purchase. If approved, the transaction completes and the parent receives a receipt and the kid receives an estimated delivery date. If denied, then the transaction does not go through and no money is withdrawn from the PayPal account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The parent creates a sub-account to their PayPal account for their teen. Then once the teen is logged in to their account, whenever they shop online and wherever the merchant has implemented it, the PayPal Teen button appears next to the store's checkout button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Legal issues we considered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you open a PayPal account, you are agreeing to a binding legal contract. Before an individual can enter into a binding legal agreement known as a contract, he or she must meet the legal contract age. Therefore, if an individual is under the age of 18, they cannot have a personal PayPal account and would need their parent's assistance making purchases.
As far as if the parent and child have a legal custodial relationship, that is left into the hands of the parents because they have the capability to create a teen account and would only do so for the need to authenticate their teen's online purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app that simulates the push notification a parent would get in their PayPal app. It runs through the options of approving or denying the purchase. For the parties participating in the transaction, we created multiple user accounts through PayPal's sandbox. Additionally, we had a mock Shopify store site with the PayPal Teen button appearing when the user is at the cart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues implementing Braintree's API and integrating the push notifications onto our button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If our hack is implemented, we would be expanding PayPal's user base. We are also proud of picking up so many new technologies and being able to pull together a hack with new people that we met here at this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use NativeScript, Shopify, Twilio, XML, PayPal's Sandbox and Braintree's API, insightful information on PayPal's subcompanies, and the considerations that go into implementing a new feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PayPal Teen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, the PayPal Teen button would be integrated with One Touch that uses cookies to preload the teen's user authentication while they shop online.
