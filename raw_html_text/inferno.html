                    our inspiration for this project is that we wanted to develop a fun and interactive game. Our game works as a stress reliver and helps improve accuracy and concentration. Our game was built using various programmes. As a team we faced several challenges a main one being that we don't know how to code. However we over came this barrier by learning to code to aid our mentor. We are proud of the progress we have made in developing our various apps with the little experience we have. We learned how to work well with each other. Hopefully, we will continue to further develop inferno.
