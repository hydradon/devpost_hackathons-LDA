                <p>
                    To get around the inconveniences of creating and remembering shopping lists.We always forget to put things on a list, so we wanted to make an app that keeps track of what we need for us.

                <p>
                    Not knowing anything on how to implement the Paypal SDK, it was hours of trial and error.

                    What's next for MiShopr
                </h2>

                    Creating a server-side client managed by the retailer, allowing them to store their entire inventory, costs, and quantity of items.
