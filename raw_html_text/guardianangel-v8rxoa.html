                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The safety and importance of communication in emergency situations.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the accelerometer of your device reaches a specific threshold cause by an abrupt motion, such as a car accident, an emergency message is triggered sending an automatic message to the user's desired email list  with information of their geolocation. The message can be terminated by the user if it is accidentally triggered. The user can also change their email list when desired. The email message includes a link to google maps with the users exact whereabouts.
                </p>
