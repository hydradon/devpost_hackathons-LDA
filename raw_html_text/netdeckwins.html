                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw an opportunity where we could help a user quickly find a way to the top.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Node.JS, Angular.JS, and Git Version Control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out attempting to use the React Framework. Over a short period of time, we realized that the learning curve may have been a little too steep for us to overcome within 24 hours. We also ran into issues with git version control. Multiple times, with 3 different people working on one project, we ran into merging issues, that took quite a bit of time to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting and completing a project to the best of our ability in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the team learned Node.JS, while others started out with the basics and caught up quickly and gained the valuable experience
                </p>

                    What's next for NetDeckWins
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible improvements in the searching and matching algorithm. Along with a more robust search platform.
