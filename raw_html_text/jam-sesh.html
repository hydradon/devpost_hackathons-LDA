                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that brings people in the local area together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app allows a user to post if they want to have a jam session at their place.  They just say the instrument they play, proficiency, and what kind of music they want to jam to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using an HTML template and modifying it with javascript and bootstrap.  We use MongoDB as our database. Flask is used for our back end server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning on writing a phone application, but our lack of knowledge in application develop steered us away from that. We did have some difficulty hosting the website but we were able to overcome that challenge.  We tried to use the Axis API and the AT&amp;T APIs, but were not able to successfully integrate them.  This caused us to pivot and use python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a functional product.  It does not have all the features we were hoping for, but the main idea is still in place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development and working the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jam Sesh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Later we plan to add features such as including location and notifying other musicians in a certain proximity.  This will allow people to come together more often.  We also plan on expanding this to other hobbies, specifically outdoor sports, tabletop gaming, and more.
