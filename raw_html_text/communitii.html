                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As New Yorkers, we find ourselves increasingly isolated by the use of conventional social media platforms. Social media has taken the social aspect out of the equation. This is since more people rely on digital means of communication than meeting in person. Not only that, but our privacy is made vulnerable by these platforms that encourage bad practices of handling user data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CommuniTii is an app catered toward individuals looking to actively engage in their community without being restricted by the virtual means of entrapment used by today's social platforms. In simple words, instead of messaging someone online, you meet them in person and work on an activity of shared interest. These activities are called Quests and for every quest completed, the user receives a badge. CommuniTii is based of the ideology of gamification and these badges incentivize social interaction. This process encourages community growth.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native, Expo and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge of all was getting comfortable with React Native. None of us were exposed to it beforehand, so this project was not only a project, but a learning experience as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a working demo of the app UI with no prior exposure to any technologies we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned React Native, Expo, Firebase and Adobe XD along the way.
                </p>

                    What's next for CommuniTii
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add functionality to the UI we have made and publish it.
