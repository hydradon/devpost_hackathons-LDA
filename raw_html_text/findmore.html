                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students who were not aware of the new environment that were thrown into when we started, we felt that a centralized map of the activities, clubs, organizations, events, etc. would have helped with the transition to college life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app requests your current location or a university and centers and places a pin there. It then places markers on other events and attractions happening in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using vanilla html, css, and javascript along with the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any real experience with any of the technologies we used, and we never used git to collaborate. We also spent a long time trying to decide on an idea that would be achievable with our skill set in the short amount of time allotted for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we managed to start and make a demo of a web app from scratch with no prior experience about web, git, APIs, or hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a tremendous amount including syntax, structuring a web project, learning about APIs, pushing and pulling to git and github as well as merge conflicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindMore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan on migrating the data for the markers onto a database and running the app on a server. We also plan on creating an option for the user to add markers onto the map with more descriptions of the event as well as make the app more mobile-friendly.
