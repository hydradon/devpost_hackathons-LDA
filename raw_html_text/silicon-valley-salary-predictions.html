                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing cool stuff in the Silicon Valley is a dream for many of us aspiring coders. But living costs are soaring. Can college grads afford live in the beautiful Bay Area fresh out of college?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app applies a machine learning approach to census data (age, degree, occupation, gender etc.) to predict potential earnings for a fresh college grad, so grads have an idea of whether they can earn enough to support themselves in Silicon Valley.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Getting and cleaning the necessary data was the biggest obstacle and took up 3/4 of the time. Then sieving through the information to look for an interesting angle.

                <p>
                    Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. I was glad I moved on to deploying the app even when I wasn't satisfied with my model, because
