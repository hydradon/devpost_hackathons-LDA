                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since we were kids, our parents and teachers used to tell us many moral stories to help us become a better person. The idea of making The Ganga Quest is based on that as well. My main objective was to make a non-linear storytelling game, where the user&rsquo;s choices can change the outcome of the story game and make Alexa signify a character&rsquo;s depth and create a compelling story through decision making game at the same time. It also tends to make user interactive and increase thinking ability by presenting information out of cause-and-effect sequence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Ganga Quest is a legendary voyage up the River Ganga looking for the missing book of Panchatantra. You take decisions that decide the path between progress and disappointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Follow a mythical journey up the River Ganga from the Bay of Bengal in search of the missing section of the Panchatantra, a work of wisdom by Vishnu Sharma. Loss of this vital knowledge could turn the tide of history for the next Millennium. You can play a role in saving this literature for eons to come. But you have choices to make that could determine the difference between success and failure. Which will it be?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explore new cities along the banks of the river, including Kolkata and Kashi. Challenge yourself with decisions that can affect the whole rest of the story. Do you save the Jackal, or do you leave the Jackal to die? Be wary of the Crocodile&rsquo;s riddle! Remember, every decision you make, every choice you click, can affect the final outcome of your journey. Advance forward in view of your choices, and work towards finding the missing book, which should hold the destiny of the following couple of ages in its pages. Find the Panchatantra and finish the Ganga Quest!
