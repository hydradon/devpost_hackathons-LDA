                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the first several months of his son&rsquo;s life, every parent wants to know how their babies feel. Many times it&rsquo;s very hard to know why a baby is crying and parents feel frustrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day we thought that we could use our developing apps and audio recognition experience to create an useful app for parents and pediatricians, based in Learning and Perception with baby&rsquo;s sounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This information, collected by an app, could be remotely shared with the doctor, who could get all of his patients information in real time. In addition, it could be posible to analyze information with Big Data by geographical area and extract statistics, for example, about babies&rsquo; health or spread deseases, before parents bring them to the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We saw similar projects in fiction series, as in the third season of The Simpsons (1992). But nowadays, technology could make these solutions real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is directed to pediatricians and parents who have babies from 0 to 3. The project consists of an iPhone/Android app for parents and a web control panel for the doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main functionality of the app is the capability to record baby&rsquo;s crying and other sounds and to be able to asociate a cause sharing sounds with the doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The doctor can access to a responsive web panel to consult his patients data and see statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We design and develop apps from 2010 and from 2008 we are working in audio recognition projects. We have developed some apps for Hospitals and audio recognition projects for the music world and big mammals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of the app is the audio recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About the infrastructure, as we are dealing with medical data, it is very important to do it with the highest standards of security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We haven&rsquo;t found any standard in medicine for the recording, sending and storage of babies&rsquo; audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype is receiving very good reviews from users especially because of the easy use and the interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognition audio technology is been successfully used with big mammals in a centre of marine animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents who we have explained the idea are very keen on the opportunity to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, all the mobile apps capability to improve communication between Doctor &ndash; Patient &ndash; Caregiver (Parents) it&rsquo;s not being used. With this app, we have learned that there are still a lot of ways to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most parents are very concerned when their little child cries, because they don&rsquo;t know the reason why. Everybody would get an app that could help to detect the problem and connect with the pediatrician.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we have learned that the app is also useful for good moments, not just for the baby&rsquo;s deseases. This is the reason why in next versions, it will be an achievement system to catch happy moments: The child&rsquo;s first words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Soundby
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The child&rsquo;s profile will have &ldquo;Achievements&rdquo;. If the app detects a sound as &ldquo;mum&rdquo; or &ldquo;dad&rdquo; or other first words that we use to teach to a baby, he or she will receive a virtual medal in his profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents could compare their son&rsquo;s evolution with the normal development of kids at that age.
