                    Going to A&amp;M is a whole new experience and we all found that we all have a lot of trouble making new friends within our major. Our program is intended to help those people find friends and study buddies to make their college experience that much better.

                    The way this works is you login with your TAMU information, put in your name, major and any applicable minors. You will then be able to connect with others with majors similar to you, message them and create times to study with them.

                    Being an app we wanted to create we wanted to use Swift and XCode, but none of us have any experience using Swift before. A lot of our problems stemmed with trying to learn an unfriendly coding language while trying to apply our limited knowledge into creating an app. There was a lot of things that didn't work, far more than what did, but ultimately we are happy with what we have.
