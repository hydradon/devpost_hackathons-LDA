                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working at a restaurant and seeing that many of the seating systems aren't that efficient and often go unused
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan is to have an application with 2 portals (for restaurants and clients).
Restaurants can fill in their tables, and the parameters of these, and then use the application to facilitate assigning tables to clients based on the clients' preferences of the parameters. Parameters include window proximity, accessibility, quietness, seating area and number of seats.
For clients, the intention is to use the preferred parameters to facilitate reservations.
