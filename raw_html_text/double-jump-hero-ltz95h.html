                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always loved video games, and I've recently wanted to try making my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platformer in which the character is constantly moving right, so it is up to the player to react and dodge obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this entirely in Godot Game Engine, which runs off own their own language, GDScript, which is based off Python. All assets were drawn by me and the sound effects were taken from copyright free websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had absolutely no idea what I was doing in Godot, so the first several hours were me looking up how to make a game and understanding the engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually have a product that is semi-complete, which is more than I ever thought I'd have after being completely overwhelmed at the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how a game engine works and learned how to make assets in a project.

                <p>
                    Better, higher quality assets and more levels.
