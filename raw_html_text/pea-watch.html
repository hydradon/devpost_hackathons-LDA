                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are technology students and therefore we always want to have the latest gadgets but at the same time we are poor...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a fully functional smartwatch powered by a teensy 3.1 that can act as a standalone watch or, if connected to an android phone, it will also mirror the notifications and give you the ability to control your music. It even has a built in speaker and automatic lighting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chinese clone of the Nokia 3310 screen did not have the adequate libraries or documentation. Also arduino's serial communications is not made for long strings
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    code that is ugly but works is twice better than the most beautifully engineered code that does not work
                </p>

                    What's next for Clu Watch

                <p>
                    Give it a 3D printed case and a suitable battery to be a true smartwatch
