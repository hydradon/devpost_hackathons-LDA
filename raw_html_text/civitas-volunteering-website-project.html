                    We were inspired by the strong sense of community in our hometown of Rochester. This website was made to harness the energy of our strong community and make it easier to be used to help people. The website allows you to find volunteering opportunities created by people on the website. You can also create events on the site to entice volunteers to help out, along with being able to see who has signed up. We built it using an apache server and mainly coded with PHP to create the backend functionality. Some of the challenges we went through was because of PHP's abysmal error reporting, making debugging a blind task to jump into. We are proud of the feature that allows users to create and join events that have deadlines that can expire in real-time. We learned how to set up MySQL Workbench, PHP, Visual Studio Code, and an Apache server on Linux, which was challenging since we were used to using Windows operating systems. If we were to be able to add more to Civitas, we would add volunteering feeds and chat-rooms to help coordinate events more efficiently. We would also add more powers for volunteering organizers to have over anticipatory volunteers, like rejecting or accepting them.
