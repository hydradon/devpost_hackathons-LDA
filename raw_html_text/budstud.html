                        ##Our Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Sometimes it is hard to know others in your college courses, especially in large classes. This app was inspired by the want to study with classmates and to have a central place to meet. This is much less of a hassle than trying to find someone during class and provides relief from the stress of making friendships in class. Perfect for your typical nerd!

                        ## How we built it
                    </strong>
                    We have been using Java and Python to build this app. The app is not yet complete, but we have general code for the main parts of the app.

                        ## Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    *
All of us are beginner coders. The problem was we went for something that was greater than what we could currently do. The biggest problem was not being able to code in the same languages as one another and trying to learn a new language. We also had trouble using app development programs that we tried, like Google App Engine and Android AppBuilder. Instead, we ended up writing code within our respective app editors.

                        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    We are proud of the template that we created. We are also very proud of the idea that we came up with. This app would be very helpful for students in college. We definitely learned new skills!

                        ## What we learned
                    </strong>
                    How to make a markup
How to use GitHub
Resources available for app building
Java coders learned Python and vice versa
Team communication like Slack

                        ## What's next for BudStud
                    </strong>
                    The next step for BudStud is to get it to become a working app by integrating the elements and creating a more aesthetically pleasing user interface. We would also like to extend it for highschool students as well, even though it is much easier to communicate with kids in your high school class since those classes are typically smaller than college classes.
