                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the start of a new school year comes a horde of freshmen anxious about how successfully they will be able to integrate into their new communities. We've all been there, and we all know how hard it is to find something we're interested in. Our app is there to help make this a little easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think Tinder for school orgs: We show you an organization and you tell us whether or not you find it interesting. Using that information, we identify other organizations that you might be interested in based on a shared keyword randomized ranking algorithm.. We keep trying to find you better and more relevant clubs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Expo, React Native, Expo's Web Browser API. We used python to scrape the web for our data as well as to do some basic natural language processing to analyze keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time is of the essence! Also, dependency weeds: Expo, React Native, and Flow all have very finicky dependencies and will not work unless you get them all to have exactly the same versions as when they were originally released. This caused us to use very old versions of React Native and Flow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does quite a nice job of sorting out the relevant projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NLP is hard. Front-end is harder.
