                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoyed Trouble in Terrorist Town for Garry's Mod so much we decided to make a couch multiplayer 2D variation of it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of you is a traitor. Who? That's the point of the game. Try to find it out and kill the traitor before he kills you. Or maybe YOU are the traitor!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pizza + coffee goes in, Unity C# code goes out. That's basically the whole proccess.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting multiple gamepad inputs to work nicely was a bit of a pain, but we dealt with it eventually.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We deepened our Unity knowledge, learned more about collaboration on the same code and how to make it not hurt.

                <p>
                    Network multiplayer, smartphones as more advanced controllers or simly a mobile version. Lots of money and fame, obviously.
