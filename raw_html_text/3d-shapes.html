                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a skill that helped people to learn about geometry.
As I saw that amazon had implemented a new APL interface, making it easier to integrated visuals into alexa skills, I had to create a skill.
I decided on creating a skill that helped education. By having visuals, we can easily teach various shapes.
I want this skill to enrich and help develop knowledge of mathematics everywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill provides various shapes and descriptions. It allows a user to click the screen to get more shapes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using APL and AWS Lambda.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were no tutorials on APL, so I had to learn it from the documentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I got it to work, and the UI is good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learnt how to use APL

                    What's next for 3D Shapes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm planning on adding more shapes, and more tibits on knowledge.
