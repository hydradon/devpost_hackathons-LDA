                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dungeons and Dragons has required an active imagination...
                    <strong>
                        until now
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to play Dungeons and Dragons with friends inside of a virtual world that can be viewed in VR, and AR. In Augmented Reality mode, a tabletop sized version of the world is made available for you to view and have fun with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you have a Dungeon Master (DM), this spin on the game gives them much more fine-tuned control over how the game progresses. They can choose which monsters to spawn in, and how to move them around you. Unlike the tabletop version of D&amp;D, there is no metagaming/peeking in this version! The DM can restrict the usage of AR mode, making the game more exciting when it needs to be.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we collected as much information on the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons as we possibly could, including each item, lore, spells, and monsters. Then, we started work on a Unity game that would allow you play D&amp;D in AR and VR. We also worked on creating an improved experience for the dungeon master, such as a much better designed set of documentation, easy switching between multiple pages of lore, and a way for them to control who gets their turn and in what order.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of issues trying to use Google Auth and Google Play Games auth in unity. I spent probably 8 hours combined on those but I couldn't get them to work. I also had issues with the Google VR instant preview not wanting to install on my phone. It made testing for the VR mode very hard because I had no logs and had to wait for builds before testing

                    Google Auth for unity isn't fun
