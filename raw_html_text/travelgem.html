                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from the original suggestions in our prompt, which recommended creating an online store with a VR twist. When discussing for what markets VR could be a really strong suit for, tourism came to mind. We immediately realized there were several gaps a new start up could fill, using virtual reality technology to bring people to locations they might not go otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelGem is an online platform that empowers explorers by curating and selling 1-week trips to hidden gems around the world with unprecedented value. Every week features 5 all-new locations, and by using VR and 360 content we educate them about each gem, while also giving them the option to book a full trip on the spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a location has been featured on any given week, it'll be a long time before it ever appears on the service again. Every deal is a one in a lifetime chance, and TravelGem always has something new to offer.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main focus was on developing a strong concept and business model that would prove the idea is feasible today and can have a large positive impact in the world. However, we developed fully animated screens on Adobe Photoshop/Adobe AfterFX and we started building prototypes for the website as well as the virtual reality application on Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the members left in the middle of the night. We had no Unity or C# coding experience before this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a very ambitious concept that requires minimal production of in-house content and has the potential to reshape global communities, the way we travel and the way we think about exploring the world. It also has an unorthodox business model that subverts locations that are usually deemed unvaluable by airlines and travel agencies, turning them into valuable and limited commodities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about organizing workflow, delegating tasks and learning new skills quickly and on the fly. Also, how Red Bull can help you at staying awake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelGem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish the prototypes, develop the concept further, dominate the earth.
