                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many sites in the Internet that offers to teach programming languages , but those aren't quite perfect yet.
Those sites teach students programming subjects by using such easy and simple examples , which is good and necessary at first but the level of examples needs to be pump up a bit. Like focusing on Competitive implementation and complexity of a programming language , there are some sites that offers that features as well but then again they only focus on competitive programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working on an idea in which we merge the course learning with competitive implementation. Student learn programming language with an automated track system which records the progress of student while learning.
Student shouldn&rsquo;t just learn &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; programming language , they should focus on other ways of implementing those programming knowledge.
At last the student is able to make his/her own project or they can contribute to an open source project and work with other peoples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website by using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, , MySQL in which we created a track based learning system which helps students learn programming languages in a procedured way and not just language but also how to implement the programming knowledge in competitive field to improve programming skills and also at the end a project session is included to finalize the course.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working on the front end and suddenly we started having connection problems with our database.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time we built a whole web interface within 28 hours , it was a great experience to attend our first hackathon.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to survive in a situation where you have to submit your work kin a very short deadline.

                    What's next for Track system based learning [CodeTractors,Education]
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to merge the programming language course with competitive learning and project creating so that whoever learns from this system are fully skilled.
