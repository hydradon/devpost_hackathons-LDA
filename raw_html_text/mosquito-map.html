                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease. However, due to lack of awareness and funding for technological solutions and treatments, it has not been eradicated yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapsquito seeks to raise awareness and raise money for malaria through a simple, engaging game. The user starts with a real world map with levels that correspond with physical locations. For example, for Level One, the user clicks on Yemen. Here there is a picture and statistic about malaria in this location. From here, the user can start the game. The user has a character that has a certain life span, based off of the percent chance of getting malaria in the country. The user can then save his/her character's life by adding years/points when they catch medicine and a net. On the other hand, when they catch a mosquito or rain their chance of dying increases. This simulates real world responses to malaria. When the user saves the character's life (achieves a zero chance of dying), then the user advances on to the next level. This game will partner with international health nonprofits and other companies to allow for the option for these organizations or companies to match the amount of virtual lives players save/points achieved with monetary donations to the cause. Users will also have the option for their own monetary donations to be matched by these companies as well.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the game and the ESRI API to incorporate a map into the game. The map appears on a page that we built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and links to the game.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with an innovative idea, and then successfully create an animated Python game, use ESRI Api and link between the Python Game and ESRI Map to make it a reality. All these components were then able to come together to form our final product. In additional to the previously mentioned technological achievements, we able to create a product that we believe could bring much needed awareness and funding to a topic we care deeply about.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to look at a lot of different APIs and what they did. The included learning how to incorporate a map API (ESRI). Additionally, we learned more about creating games using Python.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mapsquito
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Mapsquito is to further game development. Different games could be included for different locations. The partnership between international health nonprofits and this game will also be out into place. A leaderboard could also be achieved to show how many lives users have saved. The will also be the option for a game speed round, where the goal of the game will be to save as many lives as possible in a minute, symbolizing the fact that every minute, a child dies due to malaria.
