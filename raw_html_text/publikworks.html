                    Objective
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facilitate more effective public engagement around Public Works projects and a decision making process that is inclusive, transparent and effective for local communities.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PublikWorks does this via publishing NYC's EDC initiatives on the the EOS blockchain and making it easy for local residents to easily endorse or reject various proposals for public development. PublikWorks also incorporates AR into the application to make it easier for residents to visualize the proposed development plans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EOS smart contract and SWIFT for IOS app.
We applied IBM design thinking to brainstorm ideas focusing on users (NYC residents and NYC EDC decision makers) pain points. We also confirmed initial assumptions and iterated on ideas based on direct feedback from BigApp team about EDC's pain points and needs.
