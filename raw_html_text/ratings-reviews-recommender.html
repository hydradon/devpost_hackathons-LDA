                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes Yelp user ratings and written reviews for restaurants and predict personalized restaurants ratings for users, of which we can pick the higher rated restaurants for recommendation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the sparse user ratings matrix, which then allows us to extract a K-dimensional latent vector for each individual users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the restaurant reviews and use the latent probabilities as the  K-dimensional latent factors for each restaurant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For predicting the user rating for a restaurant take the inner product of the two latent factors, taking into account potential biases each user or restaurant might have.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use images associated with the restaurant for latent factor modelling as well, but had no time.
