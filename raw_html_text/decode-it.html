                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One person on our team had made a number to letter encryption, so we decided to build off of that idea and teach people how to read encryptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application introduces people to simple substitution ciphers, providing a variety of tools to learn and practice decrypting.  The web app portion is a game where people can upload their own keys and encryptions then compete with friends to see who can decrypt each other's code.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    copypasta and powerpoints and tkinter and voodoo magic
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough pasta to copy
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    tkinter magic is magic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    tk fonts, how to web app, how to encrypt/decrypt
                </p>

                    What's next for Decode it!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend to different ciphers, track time, have a duel/showdown mode in which you compete with a friend to see who can finish first!
