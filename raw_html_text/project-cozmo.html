                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite recently, we found ourselves in possession of Cozmo, a tiny robot with a big personality. He was adorable, like a puppy. He had a tiny camera that allowed him to see the world around him, and a robotic arm that let him lift things half his weight. Imagine my excitement when we found out he also came with a Python SDK!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cozmo is a cute little companion robot with a mind of his own. For this hackathon, we will go a step further and give Cozmo some neat computer vision capabilities to help him see and understand his surroundings better. We will also let you communicate with him by texting him. Want Cozmo to fetch something for you? Want him to throw something in the trash? Just send him a tweet!
                </p>
