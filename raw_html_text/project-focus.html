                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Children are constantly misdiagnosed with having ADHD instead of PTSD which makes for little help correcting their focusing problems.  Children with PTSD have trouble staying in the present which manifests into inattentive behavior. A gentle notification may bring them back to the present and help them stay focused.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the child studies, they will wear the Muse device. This device will track their brainwaves against our machine learning model by IBM&rsquo;s Watson Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using a Muse headset, IBM Watson's Machine learning, Python, Firebase, and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we ran into Collecting relevant data from the Muse due to tricky placement . We also had issues with our backend which made Watson hard to use.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments:

                <p>
                    that we're proud of We are very proud of our idea as well as being able to collect data to support our product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about backend development and what it takes to create a backend environment
                </p>

                    What's next for Project:Focus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to incorporate aspects of gamification within our product.  We will measure how long a child can stay focused and reward them with badges if they can beat their longest time.
