                    The problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know the pain of trying to make a great gig and just losing money because nobody knew that you were on the city. It's always hard to indie musicians to manage all the logistics to make an event of this kind; renting the venue, carrying your heavy and vintage Fender amplifier around, dealing with groupies, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you could know beforehand how many people will assist to your event? And what about having that money available before anything is done? Now you can stop dreaming about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With fandban you can set a minimun amount of ticket purchases that need to be covered in order to the event to be made. If the goal is not reached, then the money is returned completely. That's it.

                <h2>
                    How could you make this super awesome thing possible?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of this is possible thanks to  Mastercard's new Simplify payment gateway, which used in conjunction with Wordpress, allowed us to build the platform very quickly.
