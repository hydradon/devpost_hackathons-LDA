                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    -&gt; Had to understand user stories from Alliance For Change which was quite unique for us.
-&gt; Weren't familiar with Drupal, had to go through intensive brainstorming.
-&gt; Customizing took quite a time from us, on one end we had to add in new features, improve the website, on the other we had to take care that we don't cause any damage to the backend while changing frontend which could again increase our work for the same.
