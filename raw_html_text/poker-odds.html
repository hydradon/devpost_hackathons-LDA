                    Poker has always been a passion of mine. While many people see a game of luck, I see a game of skill, math, and deception.

                <h2>
                    With this app, you will see your chances of making each hand possible in the game. The web page will deal a random hand for the user. On the flop, percentages will be shown representing the likelihood of making a hand (flush, straight, etc.) The simulator can be ran continuously, making rapid learning easy and allowing users to test their skills.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I used an html page and used a deck class found online. All the functionality of the page was done through javascript and jQuery, with CSS providing the styling. The phase of the game is stored in a variable, and the action of the button on the page depends on the value of the phase variable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Styling and aligning the page was the most difficult aspect of this. The javascript was challenging at times but those challenges were navigated with relative ease.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I have wanted to create a poker related web page for a while and doing so today felt great. I was proud of writing the javascript which was challenging for the image src. I'm also proud of creating the page within a limited time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Creating this web page has strengthened my understanding of HTML, javascript, and CSS. I learned a lot about styling and alignment specifically.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We want to add more functionality to the page, allowing the percentages to be entered by the user for them to test their skills. There is the possibility of adding a timer to simulate in-game scenarios.
