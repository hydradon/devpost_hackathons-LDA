                    Our inspiration for #naturalbeauty came from a program we do at Girls Inc. called Body Positive. The basic idea is that we should all love ourselves regardless of anything, as we tend to do with others. And as our definition of beauty expands, we start to see the natural beauty not only in the world but in ourselves as well.

                    What the app does is creates a social movement behind the #naturalbeauty, and creates a space where users can post their natural pictures, see others pictures, create events around the pictures, blog about the experience, and users are encouraged to spread the hashtag far and wide on social media.

                    How we built it was with a free DIY development program called appbar. Right now it is in the process of being approved, and should be launched and fully operational in 3-5 days.

                    Challenges we ran into were in the design of the app and being first time app developers, we had to figure much of it out. Even with a DIY program, it was hard to figure out exactly how to put things on the app sometimes. Now that we have had a chance to "test" our app, we will need to figure out how users can upload photos onto the gallery and change the social media links once the app is officially published.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of are the video we made, and the beautiful pictures we took. We are also proud of the app in general, because we all have no to very little experience with this type of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned was that this process, although daunting, was a lot of fun and worth trying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for #naturalbeauty is full app integration. We do plan to fully launch this app, and hopefully take the hashtag #naturalbeauty worldwide. Right now our app is under review and should be fully published and functional in 3-5 days. We want to start a social movement. Later, we might make T-shirts with the hashtag on it and other merch. This is one of the first projects of the brand new Girls Inc. of WCC STEM group.
