                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet users, particularly women, are often sent unwanted NSFW imagery.  I myself, have been sent a few unwanted sausages. Seeing this problem, I was inspired to fix this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When receiving an image, this plugin immediately covers it. Then, if it deems the image sausage free, the cover will be removed. If an image is covered, and contains a sausage or other undesirable content, the tags for this image will be overlayed. The user can then optionally click an x button in the right hand corner of the cover, if they wish to view the image anyway. For instance, if someone such as their significant other sent them a sausage, they might wish to view that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using mutation events in JavaScript we detected when chatboxes and messages appeared in the DOM, we then manipulated those to cover all images. Then it was a question of curating which images were allowed to be shown, using the Clarafai API.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    For very good reason, it is hard to run your own piece of JavaScript on facebook.com, who knew aye?
AWS. AWS. AWS.

                    Choosing a name that sponsors would like, alternative names include:
Cock Blocker
Escape from Pen Island
Dicks Out 4 Harambe (where all sausages would be covered with Harambe)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel this is a very impact idea, with potential to really improve many people's browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I suck at front end web development, a lot of us do... but we pulled through and learned lots. It feels good. It's polished.

                <p>
                    This could be deployed potentially, so making it a better integrated plugin, and available for more social media platforms - I'm coming for you MySpace
