                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emily and I go to farmers' markets frequently. We realized that there are no programs currently that help our local farmers, and we wanted to do something about it. We also wanted to help people make healthier lifestyle choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows local farmers to organize farmers' markets, and gives people suggested recipes using produce from the market. It also educates consumers about healthier food options, and helps individual farmers advertise their booths. Consumers will also be able to check when there are farmers' markets near them and what produce will be sold there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript to code our web-app. We used GitHub to collaborate on the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems when we edited files simultaneously. The code was unable to be read and we had to merge and resolve the problems. We also had trouble converting HTML code to BootStrap, and we had problems in organizing the code (our script type attribute was placed at the top earlier; we also had multiple issues with placing fonts, which should be in the header).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of learning GitHub in a day. We learned how to do git add ., git commit, git push, and git pull, and were able to collaborate even after we went home from the venue. We are also proud of the final product and the cause that it supports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about HTML and coding. I understand the importance of order in code and reducing as much code as possible to make it efficient to read. I also learned how to use GitHub, which will help me with bigger projects in the future, and is a vital skill for every programmer.
                </p>

                    What's next for HealthyHarvest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make this into an IOS mobile app in the future. Currently, the app is mobile-friendly, but we would like to put it on the app store and be able to store large amounts of data on it.
