                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning and collaborating through VR/AR games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects two users to perform a shared task in VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used multiple Kinects to capture the two different model movements as well as relatively precise fist detection and fire shots with it. Use Rift to track the model/spacecraft movements through the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Rift and tying it up with two different versions of Kinect V1 &amp; V2. Making the scene look decent enough in Unity (since none of us are Graphics folks!!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting 3 different hardware with differnt SDKs to work in parallel controlling a model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learnt coding with Rift as well as generating, modifying and combining different VR scenarios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KinectOc Arena
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend it with more focus towards benefiting the community by developing collaborative medical/rehabilitation games/apps for betterment of the humanity. Develop better and more immersive games with &gt;2 users collaborating.
