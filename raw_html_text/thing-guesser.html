                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create something like  20 questions that was oriented towards kids - with questions kids would understand and relate to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to play: (1) You pick the word (the "thing") and Alexa tries to guess what it it is by asking yes/no questions. (2) Alexa picks a word and provides facts about it and you see if you can guess what the thing is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    node.js and mysql, with a little php for handing the database services needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open-ended recognition on Alexa is troublesome if not constrained. To get acceptable recognition of any "thing" I needed to structure a limited "thing" vocabulary list and tie that to the "new thing" intent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The guessing algorithm is pretty accurate. It will take some time to build up the answer database to make it truly effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to analyze question options to eliminate the highest number of invalid "thing candidates".

                <p>
                    More data and more engaging dialog.
