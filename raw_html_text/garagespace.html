                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our communities, we usually commute from place to place. Spending time looking for parking spaces, especially in packed metropolitan cities, is a huge time waster in our busy lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GarageSpace helps provide an alternative to parking madness, giving Parkers an timelier method to find a parking space, and producing an extra income for Hosts.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it the the Eclipse Java IDE, but utilizing the Java Window and Swing programs. By first creating mockups and a method plan, we first designed a app simulator with Java, and created our app through a mixture of Java, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult settling on a medium to create our app- we went through 7 different sites and app inventors before deciding to use a Eclipse IDE. 
Furthermore, coding graphics with Java was a challenge, causing us to speed learn the entire class function in a few hours. 
Finally, our code debugging was a challenge, testing both our patiences, but teaching us that any effort will always bear fruit.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to learn so much of a language in a short amount of time, and being able to code a workable model of our app. 
But most importantly, we're proud of the fact that we took the chance to join this hackathon, and chose to do our best throughout.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn new coding concepts and webdev, from WindowDesign and Swing to HTML and CSS color changing, we learned that with persistence, we can challenge anything.
