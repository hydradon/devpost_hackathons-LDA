                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackers who join hackathon events often experience team-up challenge. We tried different tools telegram, online spreadsheet or devpost.com still didn't help a lot. Inspired by a mathematical case study called "stable marriage problem", we are asking ourselves how we can change our perspective by examining this network level; how this 500 community can cooperate effectively and all our hackathon experience are improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple dApp with smart contract invites and guides participants to make vote decisions to form hackathon teams.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Leader or idea initiator use Idea Board to post ideas with 2 minimum inputs (Industry &amp; Tagline).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hackers are asked to join an anonymous preference voting with 3 choices on idea and role combinations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Team lead performs f2f sharing with continuous voters on ideas and officially form a team relationship with selector.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We enable open and flexible rules thoughtfully to respect nature of network dynamics and human motives. for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We do not force all the ideas need to be listed first. Ideas can come any time before selected closing time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Team lead makes the first move to rally the interest and mission. Hackers have rights to change their votes but at a given time, no more 3 votes are allowed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When team is formed, notification should be visible to the community, so rest of us can still focus on getting team decisions out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We understand there are other data points like talent experience and personal event goals can also be useful to provide better matching. We leave out due to execution constraint.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many small programming huddles, not effective debugging.
