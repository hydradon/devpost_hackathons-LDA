                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a retro music-based game and one example that we all loved to play before was _ italics
                    <em>
                        Dance Dance Revolution
                    </em>
                    italics _. Our game was inspired by the similar concepts and involves a fire techno beat and lightning reflexes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You must stay in sync with the both hands, pressing the WASD pad and Arrow keys in unison. Climb the scoreboards as you hit crazy ambidextrous combos while staying lit to the song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using Processing and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge that we ran into was coming up with a good idea. The first half of the time we were given, we used to make another game that we ended up scrapping halfway through. However, we are glad that we decided on Ambidextrous Rhythms! The design is much more sleek and polished than our last game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the aesthetics and how the game concepts turned out. Given the short time we had to develop, this game exceeded our expectations by leaps and bounds.
Overall, we are most proud of making Ambidextrous Rhythms work!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Processing and problem solving. Prior to going into this project, two of our members had very little experience using Processing, however, after experimenting and reading up on a lot of StackOverflow articles, we became all very proficient in Processing and contributed significantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ambidextrous Rhythms
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are considering trying to turn it into a web app, and host it online for others to play. In addition, we have our sights on implementing new features such as a song selection widget and even more beautiful game effects.
