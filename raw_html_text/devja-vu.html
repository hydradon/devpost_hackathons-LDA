                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that a lot of time is wasted on making mistakes that have been done before or failing to learn from others. We also were sometimes disappointed with the unoriginal content that was prominent during various hackathons.

                    Our project scans and scrapes Devpost. It uses natural language processing techniques to find similarities between ideas and display similar projects based on an idea that the user inputs. Using our tool, the user can discover what techniques can be used for accomplishing their goal. They can build upon the work of others
