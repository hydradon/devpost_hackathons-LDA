                    StudyGroup is a website where users can create accounts. They can list their strengths and weaknesses to get matches of other people who not only are good at the things they need help at, but also share common interests and hobbies. It is also capable of creating a study group of four people using a genetic algorithm which finds the best possible group. The groups are designed to have a mix of common interests and a variety of skill sets. Using our website, we plan to make it easier for Iowa State (and eventually other colleges) students to connect and help each other. Individually, there may be a couple topics we aren't skilled in, but together, there's nothing we can't solve. StudyGroup is, at its core, about connections.

                    how it works
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To power our site we hosted Python code on our personal website. The Python code prints html code which is rendered in the browser. Using python allowed us to make a much more responsive and adaptive page, that would have been much harder to do in Javascript, and impossible with just HTML alone.
To make groups, we created a genetic algorithm that adapts to different users being added and can create the perfect group, with a variety of needs and skill sets. This machine learning algorithm gives us the power to help students in ways that not too long ago would have seemed impossible.

                    possible future imporvements
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We would like to show more matches to the user, and allow email verification to ensure users only have one account. Integration with blackboard would also be nice.
