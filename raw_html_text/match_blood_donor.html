                    Blood crisis has been a serious issue in the United States. Recently, the American Red Cross a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness education in the United States issued an emergency call to address a shortage of blood across the country. The organization, which generally keeps a five day supply of all blood types on hand, had less than a three-day supply of types A and B blood and less than a two-day supply of type O.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the short shelf life of blood (~40 days) and the storage conditions required to keep it intact (~40F), it becomes a difficult task to manage blood samples even if there is an increase in the number of donors.

                    <li>
                        Based on the historical data of donors, we implemented a classification model using Gradient Boosting to identify people who are likely to donate blood in the immediate future
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented an E2E application with interactive geographical maps that allows the stakeholders to look for donors in the vicinity based on the requirements such as blood group, immediacy, etc.
