                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAFETYBIT was born out of the need to create a safer environment for joggers at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SAFETYBIT extracts latitude and longitude coordinates from the GPS in Fitbit Ionic. We then use reverse-Geocoding to convert those coordinates into a physical address that is sent out as an alert on an app when the 'Emergency' button on the Fitbit is pressed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Fitbit Studio to develop a simple app with an 'Emergency' button using javascript for Fitbit and ran it on both the device and simulator. We used Fitbit's Geolocation API to extract the device's coordinates and reverse-geocoded the coordinates using the Android location package. We then developed the app that would display the alert as a AlertDialog object in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Fitbit's GPS does not work well indoors, which is why we had to resolve to the Fitbit OS Simulator to test our program, although we did connect our phone to it.
We had trouble transfering the GPS data from the Fitbit app to the Android Studio app because Fitbit needs to authenticate third-party apps before giving them permission to access data from the Fitbit, which we did not have time for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never worked with Fitbit and their SDK. Two of us had no experience with Android Studio before, so we learned a lot. We navigated challenges and many trials well as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is probably best to fully learn about a new technology before starting a project based on it. Also, we learned that some companies are very restrictive with their data privacy, even though we were given access to a Fitbit to develop on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SAFETYBIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will wait for Fitbit's approval of our app, and if approved, pass data from the device to our app to get it running. We also need a more specific address to match the coordinates collected. And then we can use Google's Nearby API broadcasts alerts to all nearby devices.
