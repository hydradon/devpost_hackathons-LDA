                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minecraft, Microsoft HoloLens
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Key Features:
-library of templates, and components
-user modifiable components
-component placement and manipulation will be the key activity in developing larger structures
-benefit of architech is it provides a platform for generative design growth. 
-cost dimensions
Process:
1) scan area or measure area of space ( select a physical anchor usually a surface)&gt; template footprint gets made
2) input template &gt; template options appear and allow user to enter parameters relevant to the assembly OR  drag and drop component.
                    <br>
                    3) create assembly modules for rapid design &gt; increase complexity ( rendering, functional blocks)

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Vuforia to develop an augmented reality experience that gives the look and feel of what we want in the final version of our application.

                <p>
                    Had to start over multiple times, but we did not change our goal rather rearranged our resources!
