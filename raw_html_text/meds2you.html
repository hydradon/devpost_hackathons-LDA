                    3.5 million people live in Chicago, 1 million of which do not have any accessibility to a pharmacy. Now think broader, imagine the number of people who do not have access to a pharmacy. Meds2You by LAMA Tech is a platform which connects patients, pharmacies and physicians. Our verified riders home deliver theprescription drugs where the patient verifies the delivery with a code that only they know.

                    We built it using multiple tools like WIX and Marvelapp. We ran into multiple challenges in the coding sector because of constraints such as time and coding knowledge. We learned that a lot of technical skills are needed in order to create something successfully and that you have to bring together people with expertise in various different skill sets. Meds2You will pilot with prescription drugs and we will later integrate the delivery of off the counter drugs too.
