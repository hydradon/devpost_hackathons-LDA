                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project was a home brewing setup I have been slowly building and making more robust. After working in the brewing industry I wanted to replicate the process as automated as possible at home. Looking into technologies that would assist in the brewing process to help to ensure a final result was a goal of mine to accomplish.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application I have made called Brew Track is what I would like to tie the Particle Photon and Breadboard with several Temperature Sensors that are able to log the temps of Hot Water for Striking the Mash, the Mash itself as monitoring the Mash is essential to getting a good starting Gravity with sugars.
