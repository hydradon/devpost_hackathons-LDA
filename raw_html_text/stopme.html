                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students in a new city, we often find ourselves using any means necessary to save money and time. Often, this means using public transportation. For non-natives, or those who've never used it before, a city's public transportation service is a new beast. Where do I get off? How much further do I go? When do I alert the driver? How do I alert the driver? HELP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between the 3 of us, we've missed wayyy too many bus stops, leading to wasted time, energy, and have often ended up stranded in the middle of nowhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted it to stop. We wanted ourselves to stop. And so came the idea for StopMe
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple app that does a simple task - we want an app that will alert passengers whenever their stop is near. Currently, this is a feature not offered on Google Maps or Transit, two major public transit apps. On the bus, or train, or subway, whenever and wherever you go, whenever you are within 1 mile of your stop, you will get a notification. You will also get a notification at 400 meters and another to alert the driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an app that will save time, energy, and an Uber ride.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded Android Studio, utilized a bunch of APIs, and with the help of our mentor Caroline Duby, we tried to design an app that was intuitive, simple, and easy to use. Our product isn't finished but we are proud of what we learned!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs are really challenging to work with and implement. The grogginess of Android Studio also hampered our progress
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came in with no knowledge of APIs or Android Studio (mobile apps in general), but we had an idea and we ran with it. In the end, we learned a lot and made new friends. We tried our best and had a good time. 'Twas a great Hack@Brown!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google is our best friend. Stack Overflow is also a good friend. Friends are nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StopMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project, and expanding to include transit systems from all around the world. We want everyone to stop, get off at your stop, smell the roses, and continue your journey!
