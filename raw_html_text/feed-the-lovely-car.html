                        It may be inconvenient to find the gas station when driving and when the fuel is running out.

                        If the amount of fuel is at a certain level, the system will prompt drivers to refuel. If the drivers choose to refuel immediately, the GPS location of the car will be collect and the closest gas station will be given and the route drivers will be guided to it. All drives need to do is to press the "direction button" when the prompt shows up.

                    <strong>
                        We found it challenging to get the data of the closest gas station location.

                        We learned about a lot of front-end design skills, including html, css and js. We also learned to think the problems from a more realistic perspective and think about a solution to deal with them.
