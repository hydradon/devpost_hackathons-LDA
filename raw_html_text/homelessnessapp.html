                    Sometimes it is difficult to know what a shelter needs. We think that one site for shelters to post needs and locations will improve shelter donations as donors will have an easier time buying items they know will be useful.

                    When you are in the store, you can search location to find nearby shelters and buy items to bring for the residents.
