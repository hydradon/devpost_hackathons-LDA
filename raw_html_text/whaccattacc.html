                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Garnet and Payton wanted to jam together, but the dorms are tiny. This means you can't use a full drum set, and drum triggers are mad expensive.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Peizo Transducers as pads to play on. The arduino picks that up, sends serial to a computer that has a python script listening. Then the python connects to a virtual MIDI cable to play send MIDI notes to a DAW like reaper
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computers are slow
Python is slow
Serial is slow(kinda)
Drum VSTs are kinda laggy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works pretty well. It's volume sensitive and picks up pretty much every note, but doesn't repeat any
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty laggy to go from one device using 1 programming language to another device running a different language and then send signals over to a daw
