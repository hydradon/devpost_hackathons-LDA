                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was intrigued by the green challenge and upon preliminary research for  topic, a article was discovered in which it sated that if everyone in the world consumed as much as us, humans would require 4 earths to be sustainable. This was a shocking factor and we wanted to raise awareness towards this issue.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A series of sensors generate data for a given room's energy consumption. Light sensors measure the energy expended by lighting, temperature sensors measure the energy expended heating and cooling, and vibration and sound sensors can measure weather a energy intensive appliance is on or off. We create an android app which lets users see current energy consumption and historical data. The individual's energy consumption is measured by the amount of trees it takes to neutralize their carbon footprint.
