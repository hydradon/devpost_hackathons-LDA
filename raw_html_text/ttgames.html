                    Table-top games play a significant role in modern society. &nbsp;These games affect people of all ages and all walks of life, whether it be emotionally, socially, or mentally [1]. For example, learning highlights from playing the game Scrabble Junior fosters literacy and language skills for children, while the game Monopoly offers teenagers opportunity to develop their math, reading, reasoning, and social skills [2]. Studies from Alzheimer centers have proven that adults who regularly play games not only promote mental stimulations, but help keep memory function [3]. Research has reported that playing board games twice a week increases the brain speed scores of children by 27 to 32 percent, and two studies in the journal Cognition, published by MIT and UC-Berkeley, report that children who play games develop &ldquo;a stronger sense of creativity and inquisitiveness&rdquo; [3]. According to [2], board games are a medium which connect families to each other and foster positive communication. As well, board games help manage stress successfully, and maintain healthy relationships within the family.

                    Abstract
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Table-top games have proven to enhance the lives of people of all ages. From children fostering the ability to focus to adults reducing their risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, games continue to play a significant role in people&rsquo;s success in life. Recent prevalence in table-top games have increased production and sales for the game industry, thus providing a large variety of table-top game options to users. The volume of table-top options available to users, however, is problematic as buying new, unfamiliar games is a risk, since purchase cannot guarantee play satisfaction, and 100% refunds are not warrantied if game components have been tampered with. Existing websites such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble recommend table-top games to users, but their methodology is based on consumer purchase patterns which neglect game characteristics in their non-personalized recommendations. &nbsp;Game characteristics, such as popularity, number of players, complexity, play time, and different categorization of games are essential features to be considered in making personalized recommendations to users. These characteristics can significantly affect the satisfaction level of game play when players experiment with new table-top games.

                <p>
                    In order to assist users in finding games of interest to play and enrich the player&rsquo;s game-playing experience, we developed the TTGames application, a novel tool of recommending the latest and most personally intriguing table-top games for users. Personalized table-top game recommendations are based on user game interest and are ranked using a multiple linear regression model with game feature information extracted from online sources.

                    Benefits of board games master new skills for children such as shape recognition, grouping, counting, letter recognition, reading, visual perception, color recognition, eye-hand coordination, and manual dexterity. They also teach important social skills such as communicating verbally, sharing, waiting, taking turns, and enjoying interactions with other players.
