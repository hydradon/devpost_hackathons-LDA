                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want a world where everyone has good oral hygiene. Yet, 32% of U.S. residents do not floss at all, 37% flosses occasionally, and only 30% of population flosses daily. In addition, within the 30% of the population who flosses, their techniques are subpar. EasyFloss will help overcome some of the major barriers for not flossing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Customized floss trays that floss all the teeth in the mouth in less than 20 seconds
-Provides great ease and efficiency over traditional hand floss or water floss
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We made loose nightguards for the mouth and threaded floss between all teeth after drilling holes where all spaces between the teeth are. We began with a set of teeth, took alginate impressions, created stone models of the mouth, placed a layer over the teeth so that the trays would be loose enough for movement on the teeth, and then used the plastic mold machine in the Maker Space at the Tandon School of Engineering to create the trays. We trimmed the trays, drilled holes into where the spaces between the teeth would be, threaded floss, and fixed the floss for tightness using dental filling. This is our prototype to be further developed in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially made the trays using a thinner plastic at the dental school which was too flimsy and broke easily. The floss was too loose initially to go towards the gums past the point where neighboring teeth were in contact, which is necessary for optimal flossing. We addressed these issues so that our current prototype is effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making a physical prototype of our idea and addressing challenges. We are proud of an idea which can be used by a wide audience for good oral health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a product out of an idea, to seek different ideas from people, and learn what resources are available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasyFloss
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make a prototype from durable material. In the future we hope to apply electronic vibrations for even greater effective flossing for all consumers including people who have disabilities. Electronic sensors would detect gums to prevent gum injury. We plan to disinfect the product using UV rays, brushing, or cleaning solution with a ultrasound machine for after use cleaning. We plan to create an illustrated step by step booklet for how to floss efficiently with EasyFloss.
