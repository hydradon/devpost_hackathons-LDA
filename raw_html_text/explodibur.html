                </h2>
                <p>
                    Explodibur is a medieval stealth action game using IMVU avatars. The titular magic sword can blow up the barricades and balconies that the crossbowmen hide behind. You work your way through tight medieval streets dodging crossbow bolts and sneaking up on the town guards to rescue one of your friend's IMVU avatar.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using Unity 5.1.1 and the IMVU API. This was a one person project but I implemented a lot of assets from the Unity Asset store to speed development.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was pulling enough together in time to meet the hackathon deadline. I decided very late that Unity's default 3rd person controller was not right for this game and it needed something that strafes.I put something together at the last minute which works but does not yet use root motion.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a root motion controller, fill out the level with more guards and decor and adding an end state would be nice :)
Also comtemplating adding some physics puzzles using the explosions.

You can also download and play the latest build from my Google Drive. Rightclick and download the ExplodiburPCBuild folder. The current build only runs on PC. It also worked on my Surface Pro 1 using the lowest quality setting and lower resolution but was still a bit sluggish.
