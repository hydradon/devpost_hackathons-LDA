                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea was first conceived while a team member was serving in the Israeli army. In his words: &ldquo;Our company of 50 soldiers was tasked with patrol, arrests, raids ambushes and of course kitchen duty on a weekly basis. Half of what our commanders did all day was figure out fair ways to schedule the tasks, but human error tends to get in the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the army I worked security on a cruise ship. Having 15 officers and scheduling them to alternate between 20 ports so that no person works the same work twice, also proved to be a  time consuming task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I work for a private security company that faces the same problem. Hearing about this hackathon, we decided it would be a cool platform to try bringing the solution to this very real world problem idea to life.&rdquo;

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a tool for all shift based companies.This program takes the availability of employees and makes a schedule based on the needs of the client across various facilities. The app also keeps track of hours worked and pay earned in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 3 types of users, the client, the agent, and the supervisor. Each one posseses different abilities within the structure of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Android Studio/Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working in Android Studio and managing the link pages between different account types.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished building our app! We also learned quite a bit of Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work within android studio to successfully create an app within a limited time frame. Due to this experience we are confident that we will be able to create another one in no time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Security Scheduler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be implementing a way for employees to exchange shifts with each other without the need to consult a supervisor as long as both employees skills match the needs of the client/facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan on marketing this app to multiple shift-based companies and looking for ways to improve upon what we have already built.
