                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coordinating large events is stressful and time consuming. We drew from our experiences with planning social events for our sorority and pinpointed exactly why they are so tedious to organize. A common problem is who is bringing what items to an event or what&rsquo;s the total budget? We took these specific issues and made them the key elements of our website design.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is tailored to make the planning and organization of events smoother and simpler. The user is able to easily enter all the details of their event, invite guests, and set a budget. Guests are then able to select the items they will be bringing to the event and these updates will be available for all members of the event to see. Two key distinguishers of our event planner is that it easily organizes items to guests and also keeps a running subtotal of the items bought.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website in java and HTML. For two of us in the group, HTML was a learn as we go process. We had to watch tutorial videos and search for help online in order to get our website looking nice.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us in the group, Athena Hacks was our first hackathon. We arrived yesterday not knowing what to expect and still not having an idea. We just knew we wanted to take on a challenge and not just try something we already knew how to do.
