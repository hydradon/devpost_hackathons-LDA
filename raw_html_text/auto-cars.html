                    Today we built a way to help avoid collations by using emergency stop also leveraged with turning away from the upcoming object.

                    The main function is to showcase anatomy of what a car can do on its own to protect its occupants. This does this with the ability of the ultrasonic sensors. Coupled with the swift actions of the vehicle the crash would be swiftly and prevent mitigated.

                    The project we using the Arduino's IDE. The project was tirelessly made over the twenty-four hour hackaton period. The project uses a combination of C and C++, two highly dynamic languages.

                <p>
                    There was several problems we ran into. One such one was not knowing how an Arduino works. This was solved by tirelessly putting effort of learning the required information. This really paid off as we are able to diagnose problems with the source code. This was important in all the major crash mitigation systems. Making the many systems of the vehicle was making sure there is acquitted time for the vehicle to stop. There was extensive testing that was done to make sure that the car was not out running the system of the vehicle.

                <p>
                    Learning is very important step to a hackaton. This time we learned that even if you know nothing about something, You can connect ideas that you have previously learned and integrate with what you are trying to accomplish. This helps to make sure that you are doing is on the right track. Also there is always someone willing to help you finish your project.

                    The next step is to leverage this technology and implement into other fields such as farming and warehouse robotics. We will keep you up to date on this.
