                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the amount of fascinating sponsor APIs and wished to create an interesting product through them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we both lacked experience in web development, we started off by planning out what we wished to implement out of BlackRock's Aladdin API and choosing a fitting website template for our design to start off. We then modified various aspects of the template, such as modifying the tabs on the tab and removing unnecessary content panels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our development phase, one of our Aladdin API implementations lost access to BlackRock servers due to someone querying thousands of stocks and leading to BlackRock shutting off access to their Performance Data service. We were able to resolve this issue with the assistance of BlackRock mentors by accessing an alternative service linked through a local Javascript file instead of through their servers.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of creating a website that creates a more user-friendly experience for a sponsor's API.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about front-end web development through implementing APIs through Javascript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stock Visualizations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would have liked to add more functionality to the site such as providing analyses and summaries of the data and allowing users to select their own stocks to compare as well as input their own portfolios to judge performance.
