                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 1 in 5 Canadians will be affected by mental illness in their lifetime. Although therapy is the most common solution for those seeking a remedy, we were shocked to find out that the state of therapy in Canada is quite poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With only 25% of therapy self-evaluations (homework assignments) being completed, and with these self-evaluations being an integral part of changing one's daily mindset to combat mental illness, we decided that there must be a better way to do things with today's technology - so we created Wellness Peak.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellness Peak is a revolutionary platform for therapists and patients to connect. By having therapy self-evaluations be completed through our mobile-first web app, there are benefits to both parties - patients get more privacy while filling out forms, the convenience to fill these out anywhere without carrying around a folder of papers, and we kept the patient experience in mind while designing the interactive evaluations (for example, rewarding patients with points upon completing questionnaires, and logging in for multiple days consecutively).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conversely, through our platform therapists gain access to fully customizable questionnaires that can be tailored to each patient, as we believe each patient is different from the next. In addition, all their patient data is consolidated in one place, eliminating the need to scan through hundreds of pages of therapy homework.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A NodeJS server was set up and connected to a MongoDB database to host all the patient information and questionnaire answers. Upon either patient or therapist login, their individual data is pulled from the database and pushed once they answer/create questions. Our front-end is set up in vue.js which we learned on the spot (along with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We switched out entire frontend from vanilla JavaScript to vue.js in the last 4 hours. Also a big challenge we ran into was Jeffrey only showing up at 4pm and us having to wait for him to come before our servers started working.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're incredibly proud of our ability to navigate the complex Bootstrap framework.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of stigma surrounding mental illness, we took this as an opportunity to educate ourselves and learn more about mental illnesses and the process therapists take in helping their patients fight them.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wellness Peak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a few aesthetic edits, we honestly believe our product is ready to push to the market. The next steps will be looking for seed funding and acquiring the intellectual property behind our software.
