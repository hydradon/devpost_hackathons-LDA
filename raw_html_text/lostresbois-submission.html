                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Need for a consolidated source of events in College Station. We have all been on a python web scraping kick for the past month
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapes several pages containing events in the BCS area and utilizes a twitter account to disseminate the information. The entire process is completely automated and requires no manual posting of tweets/events
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python and the Twitter Developers API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some pages were difficult to web scrape or did not allow web scraping at all. Formatting the tweets was troubling at times. It took us a long time to figure out that tweets could be deleted easily using an online tool instead of having to manually delete 40+ tweets at every iteration of testing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It Works! Successfully created a consolidated source for events in the College Station Area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work, caffeine consumption is a must at hackathons. Our web scraping skills improved dramatically
                </p>

                    Attempt to implement the idea of consolidated information from web scraping results to other areas (sports, food coupons etc.)
