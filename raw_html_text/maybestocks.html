                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My primary inspiration was from a trading course I have taken about a month ago. The teacher has presented various highly objective technical analysis techniques. As those techniques are highly objective, I have the urge to try translating some of the techniques to code. Right now, my algorithm has an effective and working entrance strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an algorithm that determines a fixed trend somewhere along the, such as an artificial price floor or ceiling . This algorithm does not make any assumption about future. When the algorithm finds that the price is about to break the floor / ceiling (by recognizing patterns in opening prices, closing prices, high and low etc.), it will make a long / short transaction to try obtaining a profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is demonstrated by running simulations on provided datasets. (stock price from 20 years ago)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in clojure, as it is easy to reason about the algorithm in a functional manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have used a web app, written in javascript+clojure, to present most of the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learnt that functional programming is great and also got the opportunity to get my hands dirty with a little of web development using clojure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MaybeStocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the algorithm (to reduce false negatives), use proper stop loss and exit strategies to reduce loss and realize profits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's with the name MaybeStocks ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stocks should be apparent (i.e., trading stocks). Maybe is inspired from the "Maybe" type construct in Haskell.
