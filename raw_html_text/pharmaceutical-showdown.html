                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn more about the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries while creating
a game that would be fun for others to play and learn with me. I wanted to solve the problem
of people's lack of understanding of the pharmaceutical industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows for someone to form their own startup to attempt to compete with
pharmaceutical giants in the industry. You race to earn one thousand dollars before
the other corporations, while learning about the field in-between each round. You have
to react to the news about the industry presented each round and react accordingly with
your price setting. You can only control your price as the CEO; you have to react to
your production and other company's prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My program was developed completely in Java with the use of Java Swing and AWT classes,
along with a helper class to keep track of each business's statistics. Most of the reactions to the 
market is based on a random number generator inside of the Random class inside of the Java
library. These reactions are based on the price of other company's and how much is being sold 
within the company. The news in-between each round creates multipliers that change the ability
for prices, production, and stability to change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a terrible program for GUI design (Java Swing), that lacks any sort of graphics engine
or reliable text editor. This major challenge pressed me to explore the opportunities I had within
these constraints, and forced me to adapt to a new coding environment. Furthermore, I had no 
prior knowledge about the pharmaceutical industry, so I had to commit myself to extensive research
on the topic before creation of this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a multitude of information about the pharmaceutical industry and created a realistic
market that reacts to your decisions and random occasions. Each company appears to have a 
"mind of its own" and doesn't follow any other company in specific ways. I also made Java Swing
not look like Windows 95.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through my work I discovered what makes the pharmaceutical industry change and how they
operate. Furthermore, I learned about the process of drug creation and the history of the 
pharmaceutical field. Lastly, I established an understanding of the major corporations in 
the pharmaceutical industry and figured out how to create a game within Java Swing elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pharmaceutical Showdown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for this game would be expansion upon the number of businesses involved, more
individualization of your company, greater control over production of your drugs, a graphics engine, 
and several more songs on the soundtrack.
