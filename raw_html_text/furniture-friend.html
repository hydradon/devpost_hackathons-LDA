                    Motivation: We learned about this organization which helps people transitioning out of homelesness by collecting donated furniture and furnishing people&rsquo;s new homes. We had the idea for an automated tool which stores an inventory of donated items, loads a floor plan of the house, and automatically arranges furniture. Such a tool would save the organization time so they can focus on their goals.

                    Background Research: We research existing furniture design github projects and applications, which are presented below. There is no existing tool to create an inventory for new items and automatically arrange them in a room. However,  there are some useful existing applications to our goal, such as Magic Plan, which generates a room floorplan from a camera image. See below and Appendix A.

 These existing applications are the closest to what we want to create.

                    Procedure:
Our Envisioned Plan for how someone would use our application
Scan donated furniture (access width, heighth, shape, function) (maybe get access to data in storage) Roomle
Scan target room (size, height, empty space) Magic Plan   Floor Plan Crearoe
Ask for users&rsquo; preference (budget, layout)

                    Question list: 
Can we use existing APIs as an extension for our project? Sure, open source 
Is this project feasible? Yes,depending on automated vs user input
Advice for ios app development? Need a mac, they have code samples 
We can have emulation running, we would have to get app store approval for morehttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/
Team management, sync up great

                    How the Project Went/What We learned
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of our time deciding on ide and front end interface. Should we make a apple app, android app, website, should it run on an abacus?? We settles on mongodb for the main interface, and taught ourselves a lot about front end program. We where able to create login information, display a layout, and prototype the data input pipeline.
