                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds malfunctions on the rail Switches, provided with its data about the current consumed by the Switch motor, and control orders and measures performed.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python3 notebook, and sharing them using Colab from Google
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting the dataset into smaller datasets according to train signals, because we are not knowledged in managing data sets with many variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distinguishing all the possible types of erroneous behaviour that can happen on a switch, and knowing how to find them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good coordination amongst us, we did not need to make a big planning, and got to not repeat the job done by the other team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Checking the possible correlation between temperature and energy consumption of the switches, and finding it, it is a negative correlation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to be more modest on the amount of work that we can perform to bring into practise the solutions that we thought for the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lilo and Switch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicting and describing the deterioration of the switch among time, by using the data of the misfunctions we found amongst the monitoring of the switches.
