                    Over the course of the brainstorming session, we ended up deciding to work on a project that would aid those primarily affected by natural disasters with the possibility of endless applications in other emergency scenarios. The project revolves around improving connectivity between communities affected by these adverse conditions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main Features:-
Implemented a graphical user interface to enhance the user experience
Utilized the necessary HTTP python modules and Google Maps API framework to effectively retrieve GPS location of the concerned individual
Established an automatic text message and email delivery system through existing SMTP and Twilio infrastructure
Enacted text-to-speech conversion to yield an audio message attachment to be sent via email using the gTTS module
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The complexity with regards to mapping and API.
Ensuring cohesive overlapping between the GUI, SMTP/Twilio infrastructure and HTTP mapping framework
