                    Social Media is now ubiquitous and has been become a key part of events be they Birthdays, Weddings, Meetups, Conferences or Concerts. Event attendees at interact with other attendees and brands during events; but these interactions are often:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hard to visualise; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Invisible to most attendees (who may not be interacting on social media)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition existing solutions are
                    <em>
                        complicated

                    </em>
                    . The downside is
                    <em>
                        you can't use them at your party, wedding or meetup

                <p>
                    To date no-one has developed a service that makes it easy to visualise the photos from and event as it happens; sharing them with all the event participants easily on a shared screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There shouldn't be black magic in this; and it can be done with a simple website run on a laptop, tablet or chromecast.

                        This makes the solution simple and affordable.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aimed to keep it web based to ensure accessibility. This also doesn't lock us into a single display technology as anything capable of rendering a page is a potential endpoint (pc, chromecast, ipad, raspberry pi..)
A server exposes a JSON feed of content to a client, which visualises it. This content is currently located on the server however it would be possible to make offline clients which run from a cache.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We picked a new web framework we wanted to tinker with, it slowed us down at the start but was worth the effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boiling down the function into a simple elegant interface, while the product isn't feature rich we were able to get the primary function complete and stable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frequent user testing and gathering feedback on the product really helps provide direction. When your in the zone for a hackagong you become very focused on certain function and need to ensure you can step back and continue to provide a solid user experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LiveTags
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The moon... We've aimed to ship a fully functional product by the end of the weekend. With a defined scope for expansion in functionality.
Once live we want to start preparing some advertising for facebook and twitter, which will help drive some initial traffic. 
We're considering a crowd funding campaign, our approach would be that backers get promo codes for cheaper presentations and other merch.
