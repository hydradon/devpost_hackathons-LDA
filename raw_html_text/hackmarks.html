                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As there was no theme we came up with plenty of ideas, but in the end we decided to leave the fancy hardware aside and try to do something that could be useful for a potential user.  Everyone is using a bookmarks system (usually the browser integrated one), but most of the time the old links (even important ones) are forgotten and they get burried in the massive list of bookmarks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web platform takes an URL input from the user and it automatically categorizes, by analysing the english words and it assigns them to different topics (such as Art, Business, Home, Techology) using public classifiers. Also, it displays the most visited websites and a trend of the website categories which are most visited. A system such as this will be really useful for tracking the online browsing and make efficient use of online resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used php for back-end and html and css for the front-end. For the classification algorithm we used uclassify and heroku for deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We firstly decided to use Python instead of PHP, but unfortunately we had to change our minds and that made us run out of time. Also, as the sun rised, the long time with no sleep had a word in out focusing ability, but coffee and short naps solved the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Have a running platform for the demo
-Managed to work together even if each of us had a different background in programming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Loads of stuff: how to use new libraries, how to divide tasks to finish quicker and even how useful Linux can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackmarks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully implement all the detailed ideas we came up with, even though the hackathon is finished.
