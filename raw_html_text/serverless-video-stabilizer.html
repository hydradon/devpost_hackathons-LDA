                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My main inspiration was to create a universalizable application that would still be useful to a large number of people on the AWS Serverless Application Repo. Video stabilization seemed like a good choice: it could be used from anywhere from large media companies stabilizing camera footage to charitable organizations fighting human trafficking to process evidence.

                    When a user uploads a video to an S3 bucket, it triggers an AWS Lambda function that downloads them to the ephemeral storage in AWS Lambda and uses a

                    written by Nghia Ho. It then saves the stabilized video to the output bucket using the same key it was uploaded with.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the AWS Lambda Python 3 execution environment to run the code in the Lambda function and a modified version of the
                    <code>
                        vidstab
                    </code>
                    package. I modified the package to remove its dependency on
                    <code>
                        matplotlib
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        progress
                    </code>
                    . I was hoping to be able to get the code package small enough that it could be edited inline in the AWS Lambda console, but unfortunately OpenCV is a very big code base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used the Serverless Application Model to define and package the model for the Serverless Application Repo. The SAM Template defines several different customization options that affect the outputted video: the algorithm used for keypoint detection, and what to do with the border around the video. I also made the output and input buckets separate so that it could be integrated into a longer video processing pipeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the SAR errors were confusing, but thankfully the folks in Slack were extremely helpful in debugging applications. I also was unable to edit the function using the AWS Lambda inline editor, which meant rapid iteration on this application was harder.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could add to the SAM template in order to restrict execution to when video files under 240MB are uploaded to the bucket. I also would like to experiment with different architectures in order to allow bigger video files to be processed. The
                    <code>
                        vidstab
                    </code>
                    repo has support for stabilizing streams of video, which I could potentially use in the future to stabilize videos on the fly.
