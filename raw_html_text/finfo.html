                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A number of fisheries and related agencies have separate methods for the collection, storage, and representation of data that they obtain during their daily operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be so much more convenient if there was a single unified way to manage this data so that everyone can build apps and analyze the data that is available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And thus, FINFO was born.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FINFO provides a set of standards for the collection and storage of data. It also provides a standard for querying data through RESTful API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After browsing through various data sets provided by the NOAA and a few other agencies, we analyzed the data and looked for common points that we could use to produce a standard format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then implemented a server hosted on IBM Bluemix to process and serve data, along with a webapp that users can use to browse the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no prior experience with Bluemix, so setting that up was quite a challenge. We also had little experience with server technology such as nodeJS so we had to learn that as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had to learn some of the terminology that is used by fisheries, in order to understand the data we are looking at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working implementation of our server on Bluemix and our webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data interoperability is a difficult challenge. Defining standards is a difficult challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FINFO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development of the standard to support more data, along with techniques for querying and submitting data.
                </p>
