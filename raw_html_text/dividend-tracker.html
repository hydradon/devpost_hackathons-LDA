                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give people a resource to aid them and their clients to help them with tracking their stocks to invest their hard earned money towards financial freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also enjoyed the challenge of tackling a difficult professional level issue as a team.

                    Dividend Tracker is built to fully utilize the Dividend Capture Strategy (

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting our heads together, we tackled this project in the mindset of a professional workforce.
We followed a self led, self paced AGILE method; we designed, wrote a brief software requirements sheet, documented our own code thoroughly, and followed through with the entire process of, designing, coding, testing iteratively, until now the first release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We attempted to simulate and experience a fully fledged software development life cycle for the benefit of our skill sets moving forward.

                <p>
                    Our documentation, and the quality and readability of the code.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned lots of team building experiences, we also learned on what to expect and what to know for next Shackleton.
We found that our SVC strategy was not the best. We were having lots of commit conflicts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned to not write any code before designing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned lots of Python Library for web front end development.
