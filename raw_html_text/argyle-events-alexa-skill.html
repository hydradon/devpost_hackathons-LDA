                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love to create, develop and code projects. I've wanted to create a skill for the organization I work for, Argyle Executive Forum, for some time. During the week, I'm lucky enough to work on the sales side. I connect advertisers with our members, composed of C-Suite (CFOs, CHROs, CMOS, CIOS, CISOS) and their direct reports. At our events, we raffle off Amazon Echo Dots. I believe having a presence on the Amazon Skills Store would be beneficial for the organization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill allows anyone to find out and learn about our upcoming events.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the begininng of the hackathon, I was thinking about an entirely different project. Based upon iCIMS' CTO remarks, "build something, make sure you have running code and then adjust it," I thought this would be good for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to crank out an idea solo (not too many disagreements in the project), however, working with one other person (or two) would have been easier to bounce ideas off of.
                </p>

                    Run it by my management and content teams, make tweaks, upload to go live for the 2019 Event Season.
