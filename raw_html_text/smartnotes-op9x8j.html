                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app to make classes and note taking more efficient and effective. Often when you are in a classroom learning, it can be hard to take in, memorize, and notetake on all the information the professor is saying, that is where SmartNotes comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartNotes takes an audio file that the student recorded in the classroom through our app, and then sends that to Google Cloud Storage. Once the app gets a confirmation of the successful upload, it deletes the local audio file to save space. The SmartNotes app then calls the Google Speech API to analyze the recent audio file, which then turns it into a transcript and places it in a document file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was coded in Javascript and built in the React Native framework to promote cross platform capabilities between iOS and Android. We then linked the app to the Google Cloud Platform for speech to text analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some design challenges trying to figure out if we should call the Speech API in the app or use the Google App Engine. After testing, we determined it would be best to run the code out of our app instead of the App Engine.

                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for SmartNotes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add the capability to capture and analyze whiteboard drawings and slides using Google Video Intelligence.
