                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep trackers are difficult for children to wear so we wanted to solve this problem. Our solution to create a smart connected sleep tracker stuffed animal. This can also be used for children with illness affected by sleep. These aliments could include Febrile seizures, COPD, general Seizures, sleep apnea.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project monitors the child sleep habits from the metrics of sound, motion and temperature. The sound is processed is machine learning classifiers and a frequency analysis using Fourier Transform to ensure proper sleep quality. The data is also outputted to our smartphone for easy viewing via an app.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a microphone module, accelerometer, and temperature sensor connected to an Arduino Uno. That is linked to the ESP12E module which updates the Android app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primary challenge was the time constraint as we weren't able to incorporate the audio analysis into the app itself.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a very diverse project that helps out children's sleep quality.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be hard to pull all parts of a diverse project together.
