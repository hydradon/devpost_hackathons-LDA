                    Our group was inspired by a challenge one of our team member's mom faced while buying her forever home to move closer to family. She knew how much she wanted to spend a month, but couldn't find listings based on this. This is how our project came together as we set out to create a solution for many people like her. Our project is called "Fusion Mortgage Mentor".
