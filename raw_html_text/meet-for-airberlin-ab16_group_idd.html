                <p>
                    The purpose of MEET for airberlin mobile app is to enhance the travel experience for airberlin's business customers at the airport. Travel and tourism industry is a thriving business with business travel making up a sizable chunk of the industry making a total global economic contribution of
                    <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2439/global-business-travel-industry/" rel="nofollow">
                        1.11 trillion U.S. dollars during 2015
                    </a>
                    . Research data shows that business travel managers are expecting an increase in business travel this year which is expected grow even more so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we took a data-driven approach in order to identify the pain points addressed by travelers at the airport. By aggregating the airport reviews available on SKYTRAX, we were able to run a

                        data analysis of all airport review data
                    </a>
                    that were airberlin destinations. Through this research we were able to verify the key pain points addressed by actual travelers; the prospective end users.
                    <strong>
                        The biggest bottleneck that we were able to identify was the queue time at the airport that travelers were experiencing.
                    </strong>
                    And this inspired us to build the mobile app, MEET for airberlin.

                    Therefore, the problem that we are solving with MEET for airberlin mobile app is to allow travelers to generate more value with their time at the airport through networking with others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MEET for airberlin is a mobile app designed to connect you with fellow traveling professionals.
                    <strong>
                        By using this app, travelers are able to create networking opportunities and make better usage of their time at the airport besides spending their time waiting at the gate or picking up a magazine at the newsstand.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travelers use their LinkedIn accounts to register and login to the app.
                    <img alt="Alt MEET for airberlin" data-canonical-url="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110563024/airberlin-challenge/ab_meet_featured_01.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--V4S0Ruzl--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110563024/airberlin-challenge/ab_meet_featured_01.jpg">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once signed in, users are able to easily input their existing airberlin booking number to view a list of travelers that are on the same flight. The list will only show other travelers who have already registered to use the MEET for airberlin mobile app. Each users are prompted to share a simple greeting message which can be used for a more detail description of what they are seeking during their networking opportunity at the airport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also send a meeting request with the time and location within the airport after selecting a traveler's profile listed under the same flight. The app supports real-time native push notification which allows users to seamlessly receive any meeting request and messages between travelers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MEET for airberlin mobile app supports both Android and iOS smartphones. Ionic mobile framework was used for the mobile app development which was integrated with XAPI to support API calls to airberlin features. The app also supports native push notifications leveraging a 3rd party API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the idea of the app was planned based on the airport customer review data analysis. We took the idea and shared with a small group of prospective users from Asia, the US and Europe for feedback and to better define the idea of the app. Afterwards, prospective feature sets were mapped out and placed into weekly sprints to follow the agile development method. The final phase of the development was the quality assurance stage where we tested the app with an UX professional.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea was the biggest challenge. During the brainstorming phase, we came up with so many different digital experience that it became challenging to choose a single big idea. Idea that we thought about ranged from building a proximity-based game, wifi based ad network and so forth. But at the end, we were able to overcome this challenge by choosing an idea that addresses a real life problem that we were able to solve digitally.
