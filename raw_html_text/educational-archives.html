                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As FUHSD students ourselves we noticed that none of our teachers are on the same page when it comes to educational resources and we decided to take matters into our own hands and create an organized tool that could help students like us access a lot of information in very little time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an archive for students. Students are able to access resources for English, Math, and Science. This will aid their studying so that the students don't have to look for resources themselves while short on time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML and CSS. We used files since we did not have a domain. We created a homepage with 3 subjects, and each subject has units, chapters, and topics broken down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was that none of us in our group knew how to code. This was our first hackathon.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came a long way today by learning basic code, creating our own HTML files, and coding an entire website from scratch.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to create a webpage using HTML and CSS from scratch.

                    What's next for Educational Archives
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More resources can always be added and it truly has the potential to help FUHSD students in their education.
