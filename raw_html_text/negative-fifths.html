                    Why on earth did you make this?

                <p>
                    Good question. My core inspiration came from my times at Algoraves, where performers make algorithmically themed music and visuals, with tools like Tidal, Foxdot and Hydra, usually live-coded during the event. Giving creative power to the spectators is a little strange, as they in turn are spectating their own performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is fronted by a little web-server on google app-engine, which makes calls to a serverless function, which puts note information on a pub/sub queue, a . It feeds a hosted music sequencer, which sends MIDI signals to a Korg Volca Keys, a 3-voice analogue polyphonic synthesizer.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was getting a node app to send MIDI to the synth. MIDI is an ancient technology, and as much as I would have liked to use OSC, I would have still had to send note data to the synth, which only takes MIDI. Ensuring I was sending note-offs to the synth was another challenge. The rest was usual cloud-wrangling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned and understood why MIDI can be an arse, but if I had time I would have liked to have been able to send control signals to control some other parameters of the synth. Due to me focusing on a working application, I didn't get a chance to configure the domain, or implement any kind of voting system. I was also going to ingress this data and feed a little NN, but given that users aren't entering sequences, but single notes it probably wouldn't be too interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Negative Fifths
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably standardise it for other devices which take MIDI in?
