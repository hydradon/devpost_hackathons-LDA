                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My close friend, Michael, lost his house due to a blaze accident. By the time the firefighters arrived and found the central point of the blaze, the fire had engulfed all of the house including valuable stuff in his room. This has inspired me to develop blaze, and I thought, if the firefighter were able to find the central point of the blaze ahead of time, the house would have been saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, and like never before firefighters as well as farmers are able to fulfil their duty optimally using Blaze. Blaze helps firefighters to find central point of the blaze and farmers crops temperature promptly &amp; accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to leverage technology, so we used drone technology to make use of aerial photography advantages as well as thermal imaging technology to get the average temperature for farmers crops and central point of fire blaze wirelessly and accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Science evolved, and proved that the most efficient way to solve a problem is to tackle its roots and based on this scientific approach we have developed one aspect of Blaze, where we find the central point of the blaze. To figure out this approach itself was a big challenge. We analysed the causatives of firefighters historic failures, and we found out that most of which happened due to the incapability of the firefighters to determine the source i.e. the central point of the blaze at an early stage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We had no documentation to use for the thermal imaging camera.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We didn't know how to fly the drone since it was first time to use such powerful drone that can fly up to 2 miles.

                        <p>
                            we developed an app using flir one thermal imaging camera that is literally in candidate release and has no official documentation.

                            we managed to use the drone for the first time and incorporated a solution to hook the thermal imaging camera into the drone and fly it successfully.
