                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We play the IRL campus game assassins, where members try to 'assassinate' each other, often carried out with a variety of harmless toys or fake weapons which range from pens labelled as &lsquo;knife&rsquo; to water pistols and popular Nerf weaponry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to make an app which adds to the above game, players location is marked on a map visible to everyone, so that areas of high intensity fighting can be marked and used to a strategic advantage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app displays a map showing your current location. When a player dies, their death location is shown on the map. The app also shows a killfeed and the number of people remaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of a game, no one has any information on other players except for their target. The objective for each player to "assassinate" their targets. A player's target is dependent on the remaining surviving players in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a successful "assassination" occurs, the victim and the assassin both indicates this event by pressing a button on their apps. The location of the assassination &amp; the name of the victim will be immediately broadcasted to every other player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this player is the only player who is not yet assassinated, they will win the game.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client side XML frontend with Google Maps API, Java code on server backend for server side logic.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Short timeframe, lack of hot chocolate, difficulties in the selection of a free reliable map API as radar.io is not free.
