                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, almost a year ago, I was fiddling with a famous question-and-answer website, and I thought: Hey, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if I could access a worldwide question-and-answer community by just using my voice? And maybe makes it fun by organizing a global competition among users?
Thrilled by this idea, I decided to create QA Bazaar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QA Bazaar is a
                    <strong>
                        question-and-answer Skill
                    </strong>
                    that allow users to ask and answer questions by using their voice. To access the community, it is sufficient to enable the Skill, currently from
                    <strong>
                        US
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        all countries
                    </strong>
                    (26 across Europe) supported by the
                    <strong>
                        UK
                    </strong>
                    marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Q&amp;A experience
                    </strong>
                    In short: a user
                    <strong>
                        asks a question
                    </strong>
                    (there can be just one active question, but she can revoke it and ask a new question at any time).
When at least one answer is available, a
                    <strong>
                        notification is sent
                    </strong>
                    to the user's device. The questioner can collect as many answers as she wants, and listens to them as often as desired.
Then, when her question has been properly answered, can
                    <strong>
                        accept the best answer
                    </strong>
                    . Accepting an answer has two consequences: no more answers are collected for the question and there is a reward for both the questioner and the responder (see Game-like features).
On the other hand, users that want to
                    <strong>
                        answer questions
                    </strong>
                    (there is a reward in doing this, see Game-like features) receive questions from the community in an
                    <strong>
                        order managed by the back-end
                    </strong>
                    (see Premium experience).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Premium experience
                    </strong>
                    The Skill includes two kinds of questions:
                    <strong>
                        standard
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        high-priority
                    </strong>
                    . High-priority questions represent the Skill&rsquo;s premium offer and, as the name suggests, are delivered to the community with precedence over standard questions. Therefore,
                    <strong>
                        high-priority questions receive more responses, faster than standard questions
                    </strong>
                    . For example, a user could ask high-priority questions about events with a time constraint, or because she needs to receive answers as quickly as possible.
Users can purchase high-priority questions as
                    <strong>
                        consumable products
                    </strong>
                    , in three different sizes:
                    <strong>
                        singles, packs of three and packs of five
                    </strong>
                    .
The concept of a premium experience based on different
                    <strong>
                        Quality of Service for questions
                    </strong>
                    , is a
                    <strong>
                        cornerstone of the Skill&rsquo;s design
                    </strong>
                    . Soon, other types of questions will be released, as for example
                    <strong>
                        local questions
                    </strong>
                    , that is questions forwarded only to users residing in a specific geographical area. This will allow users to ask, for example, questions about local events in a city.

                    </strong>
                    By asking and answering questions, users earn
                    <strong>
                        knowledge points
                    </strong>
                    , a measure of their contribution to the community.
                    <strong>
                        Every week, on Sundays, there is a thrilling moment
                    </strong>
                    : the scores of all community members are compared, and each user receives the
                    <strong>
                        updated position
                    </strong>
                    in the global ranking and the
                    <strong>
                        status
                    </strong>
                    for the next week.
There are several statuses in the Skill, from the basic
                    <strong>
                        Novice
                    </strong>
                    to the most powerful
                    <strong>
                        Oracle
                    </strong>
                    . To obtain a specific status, a user must meet his requirements in terms of minimum score and ranking position. The higher the status, the more demanding his requirements are.
                    <strong>
                        Every status
                    </strong>
                    other than Novice, gives the privilege of asking a number of
                    <strong>
                        high-priority questions for free
                    </strong>
                    . The higher the status, the more high-priority questions a user gets. From one week to the next,
                    <strong>
                        users compete
                    </strong>
                    to obtain increasingly powerful statuses, and are thus
                    <strong>
                        encouraged to keep their activity high
                    </strong>

                    </strong>
                    has been implemented. First, in order to be sent, each question and answer must pass a

                    </strong>

                    </strong>
                    of known offensive terms. Secondly, users have the opportunity to

                    </strong>

                    The Skill features a comprehensive help organized by topic, in order to allow users to quickly get the information they need. Moreover, during the first sessions, users are guided through a series of first time speeches, so that they can gradually learn all the Skill&rsquo;s functionalities.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Skill took
                    <strong>
                        over 9 months to be designed and built
                    </strong>
                    , and the project complexity was managed through incremental Agile techniques. The back-end relies on
                    <strong>
                        10 different AWS services
                    </strong>
                    , for unrivaled scalability, robustness, security and performance.
To manage the delicate balance between questioners and repliers, a preliminary study of
                    <strong>
                        behavioral psychology
                    </strong>
                    was conducted, which then
                    <strong>
                        guided
                    </strong>

                    </strong>
                    . Among others, elements of the
                    <strong>
                        Fogg&rsquo;s behavior model and mental heuristics
                    </strong>
                    were used in order to make the user experience as frictionless and pleasant as possible.
To this end, all the latest Alexa features and best practices were used, such as
                    <strong>
                        progressive responses
                    </strong>
                    to minimize perceived latency,
                    <strong>
                        proactive events
                    </strong>
                    (notifications),

                    The main challenge I had to face was the
                    <strong>
                        Skill testing
                    </strong>
                    . QA Bazaar is a
                    <strong>
                        complex distributed application
                    </strong>
                    , consisting of different interacting parts, and with a lot of parameters related to back-end algorithms that need to be adjusted. Test it was really hard.
I wanted the Skill to be rock-solid in terms of performance, scalability and robustness, so I wrote a lot of &ldquo;side code&rdquo; to test a huge number of different scenarios, and all this was very tiring.

                <p>
                    I am proud to have completed such a complex project! When I started, the complexity seemed overwhelming, so I decided to approach it in an incremental way. Seeing the Skill in action after months of hard work was very gratifying.
For almost four months, I only focused on the Skill&rsquo;s design and basic principles, and I refined them until I was satisfied. During this time, I worked with a friend of mine (thank you!) - who is a psychologist - to bring some principles of behavioral psychology into the Skill&rsquo;s design. I studied a lot of new (for me) and interesting subjects, and all this was fun and rewarding.

Moreover, other features will be added (notably, voice profiles and APL).
Finally, a detailed monitoring of the Skill&rsquo;s usage will be paramount, in order to understand how users use the Skill and so how to improve it.
