                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us here today in this VR/AR/MR event were inspired by the capabilities and ideas brought by sci-fi writers and futurists. One of our team member was inspired by a book called Ready Player 1. Which led our team to come up with interactive way to reenact favorite movies or historical events. With the objective to re-live the moment that we love and cherish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's the Karaoke for Movies in Mixed Reality. Where multiple players can join a scene of their favorite movie and read-through the script. Throughout this experience the Virtual world plays a good part in the interaction of both players.
The juxtaposition of both the Virtual components (3D CGI elements) &amp; Real World(you, your friends, everything around) creates a unique experience like no other. This combination is allowed based on the way Hololens work

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, Hololens, HoloToolKit, Windows Speech Recognition, 3DS Max, Maya, SketchUp and lots of patience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.Developing without a second pair of Hololens, to create the multi share experience.
2.Generating Animated Scenes, since most of the 3D Models were not rigged
3.Dealing with the Network Connections - There is an issue with the Hololens starting the dictation recognition while holding a shared session as a server.
4.Making Shared Networks in the MIT WiFi
