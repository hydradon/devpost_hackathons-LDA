                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love developing for VR, and like taking opportunities like hackathons to pick a certain skill with it that we weren't too familiar with beforehand. Hit detection is prominent in VR, but one to one cutting is something that we thought would be interesting to try and create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any object that is given the "cutter" class has the ability to cut into objects through the point at which it was hit. This means it could be sliced horizontally, vertically, diagonally, in half, or in any other way you can think of. There is also a time slow down mechanic that allows users to slow everything around them to allow for more accurate slicing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unreal and Blender we were able to build a VR environment as well as make the cutting class through the use of Unreal's blueprint system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customizing the time dilation so that the player would not be affected in VR, and getting the cutting to occur depending on the speed, angle, and time between swings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cutting objects accurately as well as implementing a time slow down effect. The models created also deserve to be mentioned as we would not have been able to create them without the help of our modeler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to rely on Unreal, as great of an engine as it is, there were many occasions throughout the night where it would crash and give no help as to why it happened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cutting Edge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had our minds set on making a cooking experience in VR, and the cutting would be perfect for something like that. Adding onto this demo through challenges and possibly a time system to manage slow motion are the top two things on the list. Finding a great use for the cutting is really what we're interested in more than anything.
