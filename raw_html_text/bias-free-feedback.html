                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, ratings do not reveal the reality behind how good or bad an institution or business is due to inherent human bias. People have problems quantifying their happiness. Hence we wanted to bridge this gap in the market by building a tool that helps quantify user's feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does and how we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our platform and by using appropriate sentiment analysis we will be able to eliminate bias and provide accurate information. We have built a website that takes in voice from the user, converts it into text in real time and then does sentiment analysis to quantify their feedback considering everything they say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Psychology behind the problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two types of biases that come into play: Middle Category Bias and Extreme Response Bias.
Raters have a tendency to place ratings either in the middle of the scale this is known as middle category bias - these people avoid extreme positions.
Others rate in the extreme positions by avoiding middle categories on the scale - this is known as extreme response bias.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stuck at several stages during production especially while integrating the front and back end together. We also feel that we were slightly slow in writing code as most of the team was not proficient in JavaScript. We had a difficult time initially getting the API's to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we have got a prototype working within 24 hours and were able to learn tremendous new things throughout. Most importantly we are proud of the fact that our team worked well together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to improve our knowledge of JavaScript. 3 of our team members had either no experience or very little  experience from before. We polished our knowledge of web development and modern systems are implemented through websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bias-free Feedback
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimately we hope our platform will enable any business or institution requiring feedback in St-Andrews and beyond to know where they really stand so that they can understand their users and improve their service and we can play our small role in making the world a better place.
