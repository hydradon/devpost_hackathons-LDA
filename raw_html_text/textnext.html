                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Party DJ's suck. Why trust them to play good music? Instead, every person attending can compile a playlist they want to listen to. It's engaging, unique, and simple.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You simply text the given number the name of your favorite song and its instantly added to the playlist!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the Twilio API and ngrok to set up a server which can store and process incoming sms messages. Then using the Spotify API, access a particular user's playlist, search Spotify's database of songs and then queue the match.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time implementing API's and so there was some difficulty at first knowing where to begin when attempting to build our project.

                    Our first use of API's was a success.
