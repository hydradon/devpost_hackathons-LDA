                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan uses a lot of lists every day in order to keep himself on track, but found himself wanting something that would order his tasks for him, instead of doing it himself. So we decided to create an application that would take tasks with user-given attributes like estimated time to completion and deadline in order to assess priority and the order in which tasks should be completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters in tasks and gives them certain qualities, such as a deadline for when the task must be completed and the user's estimate of how long the task will take, as well as giving the user the option of assigning the tasks priority/importance level. The program will then use an algorithm to determine the tasks that should be completed first and order all of the tasks in terms of importance and in terms of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create a web application. We also used a few other open source projects and integrated them into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the calendar was a much bigger problem than we anticipated. We also had a lot of issues arise from using Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, and we actually managed to create a working product that we could actually use. Our website is clean, professional, and functional. We also managed to create a site that works almost as well on mobile as it does on the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are indeed capable of combining our experiences and expertise in order to create a fully functioning product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CAL 9000
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have some stretch goals for the competition that may turn into longer term goals if they are not accomplished during the hackathon, such as creating a mobile app.
