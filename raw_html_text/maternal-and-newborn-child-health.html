                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to recent study,every 90 secs a women dies because of pregnancy related issues. And when it comes to healthcare issues , UNICEF is the hope of light in the dark.
 Reasons for choosing this issue:
1.Lack of proper awareness among women in this aspect.
2.With the growing concept of nuclear families , women can't get proper guidance by the seniors.
3.Due to carelessness or some other reasons...no regular tracking of any kind of symptoms,diseases occurring or vaccinations required during pregnancy phase. 
4.Lack of knowledge/awareness of treatment facility in case of emergency.
5.No Proper information about Nutrition requirements of the woman and her baby , post-pregnancy.
