                <p>
                    Facebook is impacting lives and business round the whole world. And at the same time a large number of Facebook users encounter lots of challenges since Facebook is very broad in terms of features, especially to new users or people who are not technical users. This challenges are inability to use Facebook and its features properly, ranging from security, friends,wall, timeline, reactions,  messages and inbox, notifications, groups, Events, Market Place, Notes, Places, Platforms, Photos, Videos, Facebook paper, Facebook mentions, Facebook Credits, Graph Search, IPV6, Listend with friends, Live streaming , Mode faces, Poke, Tickers,  Subscribe, Like, Share, URL Shortener, Verified Accounts,  Hash tags,  Say thanks, Impressum, Call to actions buttons, Facebook Ads, and  Pages. Many times I have assisted friends, strangers, work collegues and family  to recover a hack Facebook account, create facebook pages, run ads and even simply accepting admin privilege in a particular  Facebook page and much more. Many instances in my life, i find my self technically assisting either family, friends or just a colleague on how to do a particular thing on Facebook which focuses on Facebook feature and i do this  because they are ignorant and find it very difficult to fix it up on their own. And worst enough, they encounter the same challenge again, again and again. Through this game in a fun free way, Facebook users will become  familiar  and well informed on how numerous Facebook features are used at a specific time and how to remain fully secured while using this features and Facebook as a whole.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a quiz software  that supports multi player to create the questionable task in the game. I further research Facebook features to create a challenge out of it. I further design some graphics to spice up the splash screen. I compiled everything in an HTM5 framework  and display in a Wordpress web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of time constrain. The game has just one challenge which is "Security Challenge".  But in the future, the game intends to have other challenges such as friends Challenge , wall Challenge, timeline Challenge, reactions Challenge,  messages and inbox Challenge, notifications Challenge, groups Challenge, Events Challenge, Market Place Challenge, Notes Challenge, Places Challenge, Platforms Challenge, Photos Challenge, Videos Challenge, Facebook paper Challenge, Facebook mentions Challenge, Facebook Credits Challenge, Graph Search Challenge, IPV6 Challenge, Listend with friends Challenge, Live streaming Challenge , Mode faces Challenge, Poke Challenge, Tickers Challenge,  Subscribe Challenge, Like Challenge, Share Challenge, URL Shortener Challenge, Verified Accounts Challenge,  Hash tags Challenge,  Say thanks Challenge, Impressum Challenge, Call to actions buttons Challenge, Facebook Ads Challenge, and  Pages Challenge. The future is now and we are working on those challenges already. Because of time constrain too, i could not add many questions and answer in the game challenge. But as september, 2019 ends, I will fix all the challenges i ran into. So for the purpose of this competition, the game is working well with just one challenge and that is "Security challenge". Its fun.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During research to find out features that Facebook has so that i can implement it as a challenge into the game, i realized that there are lots of features on Facebook which personally i have never used some before. I studies those features and discovered it can impact lives and business and the world need to explore those features deeply. Through the game i intend to explore and awaken all those those features to the game players in a form of challenge such as Notification challenge, Wall challenge,  Facebook mentions Challenge, Facebook Credits Challenge, Graph Search Challenge and much more as already mentioned above.

                <p>
                    The only challenge in the game is Security challenge and it has very few questions. So  What's also next for Genius Challenge is that i will be adding lots and lots of more questions in security challenge and all other challenge in the game which i am adding soon in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's also next is that the questions shall always be edited and update and also more questions and answers added since Facebook is very dynamic and features may change in terms of how it works and also more features tends to be added by Facebook team as need arises and as technology reinvent.
