                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to make Roskomnadzor activity more open to web community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product allows to show blocked hosts located on the World Map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It was not easy to find good way to get and parse source data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We have spent  too much time looking for approach to show &gt;200K points on the map. The right solution was : "Just ask mentors from HERE!"
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how not to plan the product,  and how to appreciate team's time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoskomGeo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        to show more data for hosts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to use timeline
                    </li>
                </ul>
