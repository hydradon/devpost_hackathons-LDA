                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love virtual reality, and we love space.  We saw that NASA just released this huge 3D map of Mars, and we found a feature where you could download STL files of parts of the map, so we decided to become rovers in VR and trek around the Red Planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are a rover.  Hear your tires screech.  Rove.  Rove really really fast.  Like fast enough it would be illegal on Earth.  All over the actual, real, data-based topography of Mars, beneath a super cool Mars sunset sky.  All in glorious 3d virtual reality in an Oculus Rift.  (only controls are WASD).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded a portion of the Mars topography map, turned it into an OBJ, put it in Unity, set up some super sophisticated physics scripts for the car motion, added the Oculus SDK and partied.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not worked with car control or physics scripts like that before and it took us a while to figure it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting this in on time, honestly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To figure out my idea earlier so I'm not so crunched for time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Whoa, Mars!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make this open source online and let anyone use and improve it!
