                <p>
                    Well, when we first knew our challege theme we really didn't know what to do. But then we remembered, that we are from Russiam, the country of bears, ballalikas, ushanka-hats and also Nuclear Plants. After that we realised, that the word
                    <em>
                        MELT
                    </em>
                    can be transformed into
                    <strong>
                        MELTDOWN
                    </strong>
                    . So we decided to make a strategy game, where player controls a network of Nuclear Power Plants, and tries to keep it safe from big explosions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Player controls a network of powerplants. In the beggining it includes only one power plant. But after some time he is allowed to build more. Stations need
                    <strong>
                        Uranium
                    </strong>
                    to work and
                    <strong>
                        Water
                    </strong>
                    to avoid overheat. Player is allowed to build
                    <strong>
                        pump stations
                    </strong>
                    near the lakes and
                    <strong>
                        uranium mines
                    </strong>
                    on uranium deposits. He also needs to connect them with
                    <strong>
                        Power Plants
                    </strong>
                    with
                    <strong>
                        roads
                    </strong>
                    for uranium and
                    <strong>
                        tubes
                    </strong>
                    for water. Plants int its turn transfer produced electricity to nearby
                    <strong>
                        cities
                    </strong>
                    . Cities can be upgraded to produce more money. If
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    run out of water or uranium, the game will ends with a beautiful, but deadly

                    We used

                        Photoshop
                    </em>
                    to create handmade illustrations for our project.
                    <em>
                        C#
                    </em>
                    to create game logic and object interaction. And

                        Unity game engine
                    </em>
                    to connect all parts to the real game.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Graphics was one of our most difficult challenges. Not to draw stuff, but to connect every possible position of roads and such stuff. Also a difficult challenge was to check connections between objects.

                <p>
                    Well we almost overcome all difficulties that we have faced during our work.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Actually, it was the first time we have ever used C# and Unity))) So everything that we did was new to us.

                    What's next for Meltdown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meltdown has Great potential for further development. It has many objects which could be included to game. We also wanted to include system of
                    <strong>
                        Random Events
                    </strong>
                    . After we will agree, that desktop version is made by 100%, we will adapt it to

                        Android
