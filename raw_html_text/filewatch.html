                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    87 percent of senior managers regularly upload work files to a personal email or cloud account.
51 percent have taken files with them after leaving a job&mdash;twice as many as office workers in general.
58 percent have accidentally sent the wrong person sensitive information.
Let me restate that: 58 percent percent of senior managers &ldquo;have accidentally sent the wrong person sensitive information.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FileWatch watches almost all files you upload the-the internet; Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Github. Any time a file is uploaded to any of these services, the service instantly starts analyzing the content for possibly sensitive information. If sensitive information is found, it immediately notifies the user via SMS and eventually a phone call. If permission is given, it'll quarantine the file until further action is taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this on top of an older open-source project I created. I made this version stronger by 1) extending the application to support more file sharing services. 2) Boosting model for detecting Credit Cards, SSNs, street addresses, financial information, phone numbers and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally implementing changes I've wanted to make but haven't had a push to do before. Using Twilio as a method of notifying users of potentially sensitive uploaded material was excellent, and boosting the accuracy of my classifier was also a nice touch.
