                        Long long ago ... *
                    </em>
                    (on Nov 12, 2016) we met the one, the only, the Jibo. A friendly, helpful, and intelligent robot for the home. That was when our adventure began with Jibo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an alarm clock with Jibo, but that failed. Since we were programming heavy past midnight with doses of energy drinks, we were reminded of our friend who likes to party hard, all day every day.  They became our inspiration to create a Jibo which was equally enthusiastic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Program
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Party Time with Jibo was made on the jibo sdk platform that provides an interface to control jibo's movements, actions, and personality!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, Party Time with Jibo was born where you get to party hard at every minute of the day!
