                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aim of our project is to raise awareness of the overuse of resources
and high emissions across the world, which are driving climate change and
destroying habitats world-over. In order to motivate this, we have developed
a Shiny App which enables the user to input details of their journeys, including
mode of transport, starting location, end destination, and then compare their
consequent carbon footprint with the national average of their home country. By
giving the app the element of comparison, it becomes less of a negative thing
and gains an aspect of improvement and competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does/how we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has been designed in Shiny App (because none of us have any expertise
in app or website development), using R, using emissions data from the World
Bank for the per capita country averages. We also used World Bank data on
automobile emissions for various brands, models and fuel types and similarly
for buses, trains and aeroplanes. By inputting the start location and end
destination of their journeys, the app calculates the journey distance for the
chosen mode of transport and thereby finds the resulting CO2 emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the app compares the total journey emissions against the national
average, where it can be decided whether the user has beaten their nation or
not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of expertise in app or web development. Different coding language expertise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The variety of parameters choosable in the app. For example, when travelling by car,
the user is able to specify brand, model type, year, fuel type... and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Shiny App and calculate carbon emissions for almost any journey, via
various modes of transport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Can you beat the average?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would also like to include calculations of the CO2 emissions
resulting from household gas and electricity usage and factors concerning waste
and food miles, in order to get a complete picture. It would also have been good
to make an actual app or game, for nicer user interfacing.
