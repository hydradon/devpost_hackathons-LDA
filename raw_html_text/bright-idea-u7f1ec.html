                <p>
                    Our goal was to build a safer light system for walkways, especially around campuses. As students who walk back home or to bus stops late at night, we have noticed that many walking paths are dimly lit and feel unsafe. We wanted to create a more energy-efficient and safe system so that students don't need to worry as much about late night walks.

                    There are three parts to our project. The first focuses on the energy efficiency where the lights change brightness based on the lighting around it. If it's sunny, they stay off, but as it gets darker, it proportionally increases in brightness. The second part is the emergency system where if the
