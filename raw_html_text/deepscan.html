                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of UC Berkeley graduate students who are passionate about changing the way the healthcare industry works in most parts of the world. Coming from third world country and having limited healthcare resources ourselves, we have felt the acute pain of the repercussions of inaccessible and unaffordable healthcare facilities. The very reason for embarking on this journey of Health ++ was to leverage our knowledge and approaches in fields not necessarily related to medicine and use them to find alternative solutions that challenge the status quo in today's healthcare industry.

                <p>
                    We came up with this acute need of providing accessible, available and affordable healthcare for the segment of the population that is devoid of these basic necessities due to economic, societal or geographic conditions. Our scalable solution makes medical imaging (MRI) affordable and accessible to everyone by using deep learning namely,  Cyclic Generative Adverserial Networks to generate MRI from CT scans.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We obtained two public datasets of images consisting of CT Scan and MRI images of some patients. We use these datasets to train a cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The cyclic GAN tries to estimate two modes- one to convert a CT Scan into MRI and vice-versa. MRI is generated from a CT Scan and then a model is estimated to generate a CT Scan again from it. The cyclic GAN is trained such that the loss between original and estimate CT Scans is minimum. The model thus gets trained to convert a CT Scan to MRI. It is important to note that the data of CT Scans and MRI used for training might not be a one-to-one mapping.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially were very interested in working in the mental healthcare domain. A challenge there was pivoting away from an open-ended idea and agreeing on the idea of a generative model for predicting MRIs since here we were more certain of the desired outcomes. 
Some of the technical challenges we faced were, collection of relevant good quality data, compute power, constraint training time and having lesser time to fine-tune our model.
For our DeepScan project, contemplating the validation of our approach was very tricky and trying to figure out what metrics, for example, AME or PNSR should we use to capture the accuracy of the model was debated in the team.
It was interesting for us as technologists to actively think about adoption at all stages of our solutions and to keep our patients in mind, limit our solution to not be a replacement of current MRI machines but instead, view it as a substitute for creating accessibility and affordability in regions that are devoid of such expensive facilities.

                    We have finished the end to end implementation of the project and are very happy about the above par results.
