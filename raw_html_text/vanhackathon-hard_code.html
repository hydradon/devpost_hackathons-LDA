                        What was the hardest part?
Learning new technologies on the go. I had done a few RSpec tests but I wasn't familiar with FactoryGirl for example. Also, I tried to use Redis as the database, ended up spending a lot of time searching for a good ORM gem for it, but either redis-orm and Ohm are a bit buggy. Also, when I tried to use UUID as the primary key for the

                            If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Don't underestimate the amount of time this will take. I thought building an API from scratch was easy, ended up having more problems than I accounted for. Also, perhaps I should have sticked to ActiveRecord instead of experimenting so much.

                            If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be? 
Well, I would give me more time. Seriously, I don't think there's anything to change, it was just about right.
