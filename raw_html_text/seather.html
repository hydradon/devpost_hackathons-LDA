                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lately, when I get out of class to go back to my dorms there always seem to be light showers, which while a small inconvenience gets me completely wet if I go without my raincoat/umbrella, which many times I forget. Hence I strived to create an app that will inform the user about the weather information before and after the class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    AIM| How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App would take the user's school schedule from Mon-Fri (User would manually input/take from google calendar)
Compares time from the 12 hours from the Accuweather API to check if there are any weather problems before or after the class. Would Send notifications to the user about the weather before class if there is a problem. There are 5 classes, 4 to retrieve the data from the AccuWeather API and present them.
-AccuData
-AccuRequest
-WeatherAdapter
-Schedule
-Main

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, in my android studio, the manifest files failed to work, hence I wasn't able to complete the project as it could not be compiled. Currently, the code only consists of 4/5 classes, and only works like a normal weather app, as android studio problems occurred early.

                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time and a fixed android studio, the app would be completed, and I would try to improve the user UI. Because if the UI is not good user will not use the app, hence the use of a UI is important.
