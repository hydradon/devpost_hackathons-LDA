                    We all know how hard it is to find a good movie to watch and with the vast amount of content to choose from the decision only becomes harder. So, how do you go about this problem? 
You can of course do it the old fashioned way of filtering by release year, genre, actors, ratings or similar, but this method still have a high hit/miss ratio.
We have seen that this can be improved by analyzing what you and others watch with machine learning. And this method of trying to get a computer to know you really does work! However if you think about it, your friends probably know you better than any modern computer does. Google does of course know more about me than I care to admit, but I would still trust the recommendation of a friend than google.

                    So now imagine a world where people watch movies and recommend the good ones to their friends and colleagues. One can easily see this a huge stepping stone to a utopian society. If it wasn't for the fact that you forgot the name of that awesome movie that mixes the good parts of the hobbit with the bad parts of Bridget Jones diary, that Greg spoke so highly of at that party one time. And what about that classic movie that you really have to watch, but constantly forget the name of?

                    Here is where Nucleus comes into the picture. We have created an app that allows you to create playlists of movies to watch. If you are lucky enough to have friends you can also suggest movies to them and they will show up in their playlists.

                    We solved this using enterprise java and react.js hosted on a tomcat appserver.
In the future we would look into more ways of interacting with your friends, by for example synchronized watch a movie together, or maybe with a stranger...or 5 of them!
