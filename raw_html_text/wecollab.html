                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was born from the concept of letting artists collaborate with other artists based on common interests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets users upload their music, listen to other artists' music and build playlists. It also lets users collaborate with other users based on what is trending and recommendations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The demo was purely built using Bootstrap embedding the SoundCloud widget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were how to not make this another Spotify or SoundCloud because all these apps play music and lets users create playlists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conceptually, we were still able to differentiate this based on the collaboration aspect where the app would recommend users  to collaborate with based on common interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a good team building project where we learned each others skills ranging from UI development to back end development and learning new skills like: consuming APIs, using GitHub, Heroku, Bootstrap, Ruby/Rails, etc.
