                    Inspiration &amp; What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love to travel. And tools like Skyscanner make that a lot easier for us. Recently Stephanie went on a surprise trip all arranged by her friend, but the friend took a lot of time to arrange it. That is what we want to change! By using Skyscanner we can easily generate a flytrip (roadtrip with planes) within your budget and time schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend was Django with REST. Frontend was a webapp using AngularJS.
We used the Skyscanner API for all flights and hotel information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've found that doing multiple hops within a certain budget is difficult to do. Or you can be way over budget, or you will only generate one hop. This needs to be improved in the future. Also, some regular programming bugs are still present.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    The spinning globe :D

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend team had never done backend before, which was quite a challenge for them. Through this hackaton they did learn a lot in a short amount of time.
