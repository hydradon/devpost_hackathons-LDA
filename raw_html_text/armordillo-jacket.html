                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from the happenings of the Kent State Campus on May 4, 1970 as well as the global climate today. What could have been different when Kent students in the 70s were utilizing their constitutional right to assemble peaceably? How can we make protestors today safer? To answer these questions, we derived ideas from suggestions of what to bring to protests and coupled it with optional armor within the jacket.
                    <strong>
                        Making change
                    </strong>
                    can be dangerous, but with the armordillo jacket, it
                    <strong>
                        can be more accessible for all.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This jacket serves as a hybrid bulletproof vest with several pockets for the essentials of protesting. These features include pockets for an ID, telephone sheet (numbers to call in case of emergency), first aid, and mobile chargers as well as a compartment that runs down the left sleeve to connect a phone's charge when it is being held in-hand. Additionally, the design features light tech fabric that reacts to flash photography and completely blacks out the face and hands of the wearer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the optional placements for Kevlar panels around the idea of a lining. Connected to this "lining" that opens to the top, there are pockets sewn to it as to not see the stitching on the actual garment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a jacket with multiple yoke-like pieces that have their own open linings sewn into the seams is unfortunately difficult and was not made easier by the light-tech fabric.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept has been well-received by many and it is rewarding to think that this creation could truly benefit people fighting for a better future around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kevlar is
                    <em>
                        expensive
                    </em>
                    and light tech fabric is a fascinating fabric!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Armordillo Jacket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this prototype created during the hack, we hope to recreate in the desired fabrication with Kevlar, as well as finding a method to make the pockets' contents more discreet. We also hope to integrate an insulated pocket for protestors who need to keep temperature-sensitive medications with them.
