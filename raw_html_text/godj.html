                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we are constantly overwhelmed about our school work and exams. It is important to balance between our school lives, and social lives. After a long week of tedious exams and school work, going out and having fun is almost a necessity to our sanity. The GoDJ app allows college students to have the ultimate experience on their night out and relieve their stress.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to request any song they would like to have played to the DJ at an event. This is a much more efficient way to request the song you want rather than pushing through a crowd to request a song from the DJ face to face. Users will also be able to "favorite" the songs that they like and add it to a playlist. The DJ will be able to see a list of songs requested in order of most commonly requested, clear handled requests, and immediately open the Spotify application with the requested song pulled up, so they don't have to take time to search it up.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put forth plenty of time to make a basic plan and outline of what we were going to do so we knew exactly where to start and what we needed. We then used Android studio to make the android app, and used Eclipse to make the server application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us was our time management. We overestimated the time we had and our ideas were a little too complex for our limited amount of time. In the end, we were forced to cut down a lot of the features we were planning to have. Another challenge we had was that we focused too much on the user interface and design rather than the basic functionality. A lot of our time went towards the design when we should have worked harder on the functionality.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the time crunch, we are proud that we were able to finally produce working code under all the pressure. At the beginning, we were stuck on one part of the code for a few hours. After we got help and fixed the issue, we were able to zoom through the rest of the code because of the plan that we made before we started coding which laid out everything that had to be done, making it easier for us to code along the way.

                <h2>
                    What's next for GoDJ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add many new features to our app. One of the things we want to add is a voting option, where the users can vote on which song they most want played. This would make it easier for the DJ to choose which song should be played and would also entertain the crowd. Another thing we want to add is abuse management that takes care of repetitive song requests.
