                    What did we create?
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    How we built it.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WebMD is built as a web application built with HTML and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated a Natural Language Tool Kit library in python for sentiment handling but ran into difficulties
with calling a python script from javascript and retrieving the data back in the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we have in store for CutieMD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Greater versatility in illnesses that CutieMD can handle, incorporation of a Medical API for symptom diagnosing,
and an option for livechat with a medical professional (medical professional not included).
