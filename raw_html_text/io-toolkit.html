                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am helping a professor with some research, and part of that entails running the output of a data scraper through a text analysis program. The problem is that the data scraper exports the data as a .txt file with multiple lines per entry to make human-readable, but text analysis program required a .csv file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This package contains a collection of helpful tools to assist with IO and data processing between existing software programs. The current purpose is for the .txt to .csv conversion, but it can be expanded to contain more tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built in C using the the stdio library so that it can both quickly and on multiple platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't used C very much, and it was sometime hard to tell if I needed scanf("%s", &amp;variable) or gets(str) to get the input in correctly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For having just started learning C, I got it to work well enough I could use it generate the output I needed to run the text analysis program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about file IO and Strings in C.
                </p>

                        Allowing for .csv files to have variable length rows
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making the conversion work the other way (from .csv to .txt)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allowing the users to create and load configuration file so they can run it repeatedly for files with the same headings (same output format with different data in it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add more types of converters.
