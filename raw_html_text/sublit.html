                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As University of Waterloo students who are constantly alternating between co-op terms and school terms, we have found ourselves either needing a place to sublet or looking for another student to sublet from us. Term after term, the process of connecting with others in the Waterloo/Kitchener region seemed to be a nuisance for both the subleter and subletee. Creating a simple, easy, and useful solution to this common problem that so many students like ourselves face was the inspiration for EasySub!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasySub is an Android Application that links individuals looking for a property to sublet with others hoping to sublet their properties. It does so through an intuitive interface that allows any subletter to view available properties in the Kitchener/Waterloo region, read the property details, and contact the sublettees of the properties that interest them. On the other hand, as a sublettee, you can post descriptive details about your property, including pictures, price, and amenities to entice the many subletters browsing on EasySub.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasySub was programmed in Java using Android Studio. A Google Maps API was implemented to help users view the available properties around them on a map.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Android Studio proved to be a bigger battle than expected.  The process of downloading, setting up, and gaining familiarity with the IDE seemed to be half the battle of the entire hackathon. Nevertheless, we were able to complete the app with time to spare.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the unfamiliarity of Android Studio came many opportunities to strengthen our debugging skills. This helped to reinforce our programming ability and learn coding techniques that we will never forget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Maps API and how valuable networking is at hackathons like Hack the North.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasySub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for EasySub are to continue adding features that will simplify the process of connecting students who are looking to sublet. Some of these features include sublet agreements between the subletter and sublettee,monthly rent transfers, and the ability to rate properties after subletting them.
