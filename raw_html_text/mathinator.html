                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living with a kindergartener and a third grader at home, I understand that math is one of the more difficult skills to practice. In tutoring centers like Kumon, it's taught through rote memorization and practice, while in schools it's often taught ineffectively for students with different learning styles. Considering the universality of Amazon Alexa skills, I wanted to build a skill that would allow users to easily practice math problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathinator allows users to initiate math quiz games. You simply download the skill and then ask for quizzes of varying levels, which then test addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. The games are set for a pre-determined amount of time, and high scores are recorded over time to allow players to keep track of their highest scores for the day. Points are rewarded based on quickness to respond and accuracy, rewarding fast answers with more points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was build in Javascript using Amazon Lambda Management Console and the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to figure out how to store scores, as well as how to keep track of scores over time (especially since there was no easy integration for locally hosted databases to be used in the Amazon Alexa development environment).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first skill that I've published, so I'm excited to be sharing this with the rest of the Amazon Alexa community!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about building skills and intents in the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit environment, setting up databases via AWS, and how to integrate Lambda functions with my application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mathinator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to upgrade Mathinator with even more features, including a customizable timer, more math skills, and custom levels.
