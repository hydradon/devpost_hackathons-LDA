                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Play Services to get the current location and send it to the Yelp API to get a list of restaurants.
Once we randomly select one, with a given radius, we use Google Maps and Google Directions API to show step by step directions to the unknown restaurant. The Map is drawn with help from Google Roads API to make them smoother and more real life to actual driving paths.
                </p>

                    Making the directions as accurate as possible and gathering the correct GPS Data.
