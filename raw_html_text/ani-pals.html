                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pets get lonely just like humans do. We wanted to build an app that connects pets and owners so that your pets can have friends to have fun with.
Our inspiration was dating sites like Tinder or Eharmony that allow humans to connect with each other, We thought we could do a similar thing to allow pets to connect with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user signs up as a pet owner looking for play mates for his/her pet. The user then adds their pets to the app and can swipe right on other pet profiles for pets that match the personalities of their pets so they can organised a play date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to help us code the app. This used java mostly and allowed us to work on both the front and back ends of the program easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were unfamiliar with android studio we struggled at times with the syntax and methods we were able to use but we were able to find solutions using online tutorials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our features to work collectively on the app such as the swipe feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to effectively create apps on Android Studio
                </p>

                    What's next for Ani Pals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some features that we did not have time to implement such as messaging other users (pet owners) and also you can currently only register one pet per user but in the future we would like owners to add multiple pets on the app.
