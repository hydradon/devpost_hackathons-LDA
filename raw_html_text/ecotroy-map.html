                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our want to help the community. With CGI's challenge of creating something for the community, we figured creating something that any student or visitor to Troy could utilize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In its current state, only the map is fully functional. It allows any user to see a map of Troy campus as well as see a series of icons that explains points of interest, in this case places that have recycling bins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EcoTroy has been fully deployed to both a website and an Android application. It is also hosted on GitHub, so if another institution wants to make their own version of the map, they can go right ahead!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the main map using a mixture of custom HTML, CSS, Javascript, mixed with Bootstrap to help with the quick prototyping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the art, we had our graphic designer create our map and icon images by hand, and then digitally scan them to use on the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Android app was created using Cordova and some custom XML configurations in order to convert the web pages into mobile app that can work without internet connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile port had many issues due to our lack of experience creating Android applications. Due to our lack of experience, we had to spend significantly more time than we were expecting in order to get it completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a nice looking, fully functional, and completely deployed application out! We are proud that our product has not only met our minimum functional vision, but surpassed it by also being available on Android and accessible from the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several things while developing the EcoTroy map. We learned how to do more in depth customization of bootstrap themes, how to port a web application to Android, and finally, how to incorporate more complex art in our app design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EcoTroy Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to learn how to work with Databases and ReactJS to make the map more dynamic and allow users to submit their own points of interest or suggestions to the map.
