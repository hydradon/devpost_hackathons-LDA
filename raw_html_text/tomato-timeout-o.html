                    Tomatoes...and the theme of the hackathon.

                    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed in the 1980s by Fracesco Cirillo based on a tomato-shaped kitched timer he used. The technique uses a timer to break down work into 25-minute intervals followed by short 5-minute breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro (Italian for "tomato"). At the end of four intervals, an extra long break is awarded to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a tomato purely using html and css. Then, using JS, we animated the tomato to open up and reveal a timer. The timer would then count down notifying the user with alerts when they were on a "work" or "break" period. Additionally, a progress bar beneath the tomato keeps track of which pomodoro the user is currently on. Finally, we included a table below that the user can update with the tasks that they are working on, much like a to-do list.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, ironically. A lot of things we wanted to implement turned out to be beyond our reach. Additionally, getting the pieces of the tomato to fit perfectly into position and move the way we wanted them to was really complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the tomato with pure html/css was pretty cool. Rather than just chopping up a picture of a tomato, we made it ourselves. The timer was also a bit complicated to get perfectly right, especially when it had to be tied in with the progress bar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Version management is really important. And having everyone be up to date on how to use github as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We originally wanted to include several other components such as API integration with random trivia APIs so that the user could have fun on their break or APIs that gave health and relaxation tips, such as meditative activities. However, these features didn't end up fitting our timetable for the hackathon and we chose to instead focus on refining the components we had in place.
