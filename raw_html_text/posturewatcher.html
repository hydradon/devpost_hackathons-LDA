                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that there were a lot of people with very bad postures at the hackathon and around school so we decided that they needed to find  a product that could help them.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using Shopify. Our group worked on logos, the website layout and how we could market this product to create a successful business model.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the day, we went to the workshops for Web Design and met a lot of people with very bright minds who gave us various insights on our ideas. We tried building the website using HTML, CSS, JS, at the start. But, as time went on, we realized that this idea was not a feasible goal if we kept coding with HTML. We decided that we should make the website look as good as possible by using Shopify. We also talked to the gentleman from smile.io who gave us some information on the company. We wanted to implement this into our site, but unfortunately, we did not have time to add this into our hack.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we could have the honour of coming to StarterHacks. During this hackathon, we accomplished a lot of things. We went to the workshops and learned a lot about different things like Web Design and Marketing. We are proud that we could have a final product that functions to our liking. And most importantly, we are proud that we could work together collaboratively in a group to provide a product to present today.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate and work together as  a team to produce and end product. We also learned a lot about marketing and implemented it by making different ads for certain demographics that we would like to target
                </p>

                    What's next for PostureWatcher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we do not think that we will further this this idea any more than it is at today, we will certainly use this experience to move forward in the e-commerce field. We will certainly keep working together in a group to create more products in the future and maybe create another e-commerce business.
