                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time programming and I just wanted to make something fun for me and my best friends to use! It has a lot of fun/funny links in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It links to several websites/videos, including tumblr, rainymood, YouTube, and ifunny,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and some Javascript to make this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Psych major and half of the time, I was just trying my best to keep up with coding and the rules of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering I have never coded before and had never even heard of CSS before this event, I am proud that I actually made something that looks decent, let alone something that works. Hopefully, I will get to share this with my friends and we can have some fun with it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through building this project from the ground up, I was able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, possibly some slightly more difficult techniques from rigorous web-searching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Best Friend Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, I would want to add a menu bar and a few more pages to it.
