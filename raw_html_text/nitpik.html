                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our many years as friends who play video games together, there have been a lot of times that each of us have done things that others have not agreed with. In those moments either our personalities prevented us from offering constructive criticism or we didn't communicate our disagreements as effectively as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NitPik allows friends to offer constructive criticism anonymously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NitPik uses Android, React &amp; Redux on the client and Koa &amp; Node.js on the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a long time to successfully implement a method that would extract a user's friends from an endpoint on Facebook's development API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In less than 36 hours we managed to create an app on both the web and android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NitPik
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scaling NitPik to an alternative Social Media platform that will encourage people to give more constructive criticism and enable more people to receive and digest constructive criticism. In the future _ NitPik _ will have features like anonymous friends voting on wether or not a criticism is constructive and notifications when someone has posted a criticism or voted on a criticism.
