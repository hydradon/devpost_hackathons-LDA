                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of their 3rd-to-last semester, every college junior starts talking about their "senior trip" ideas: some want to travel to Thailand, others to Italy, and others to Zion National Park. We realized that a social media platform could effectively aggregate everyone's travel wishlists and thus make vacation planning easier for users. Enter WeTrip!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeTrip is a social media site exclusively designed for travel. Users can share their travel wishlists with others, bookmark destinations, create vacation groups, post pictures, and leave reviews. This creates an interactive environment where 1) users can easily form travel groups based on their friends' benefits, and 2) users benefit from crowdsourcing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end of the website was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The back end of the website leveraged linear algebra in the form of Python and Django to create databases of multiple attributional relationships. Key attributes included in our databases included the users, their reviews, the destinations, the groups, the bookmarks, and the photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backend was built from Amazon's cloud services. We used S3 for hosting media files and elastic beanstalk to deploy our Django application. The model for our website was housed in RDS in a postgres database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time one of us had ever done web dev, so naturally it took a bit of time getting used to HTML and CSS. Designing a social media website with so many attributes all interconnected with each other was also not an easy task to think of and accomplish within the alloted 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a technical perspective, we brushed up a lot on Django, HTML, and CSS. From a personal satisfaction standpoint, this was Mickey's first ever hackathon and Kevin's most dedicated hackathon: we were able to finish our hack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a multifaceted website from scratch is no easy task, and we have certainly gained an appreciation for those who work in web development. Tasks need to be efficiently split between front end and back end with a smooth integration afterward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeTrip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of the Yelp API for more granular tourist attractions, using NLP to add news stories to different destinations, and machine learning recommendations for users.
