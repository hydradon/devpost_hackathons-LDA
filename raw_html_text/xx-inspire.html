                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we are in some pretty dark times in society. This is why our team built an app which allows for people to share their opinions on an app and build community. We felt that if we had some sort of image gallery online for people to see, we would be able to make an impact of women and civil rights everywhere. One voice can be something, but many together can really make a difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users draw an image onto a browser-based platform, prompted by the line, "What is feminism to you?" The user can then submit their image of feminism to a community-based gallery. Users can then browse this gallery to see what people currently think feminism is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this site using a combination of HTML and CSS. Since all of us had no experience with either of these platforms, we found this to be extremely difficult to learn. But eventually, we were able to finally build a (kind of) working prototype of the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since all of us were beginners, we basically had to crash course on HTML and CSS. Luckily, however, there are many tutorials online that we were able to stumble through. However, we were never able to get the drawing part of the site working because we didn't have a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to build a site in less than 12 hours. We also learned a ton through this experience. I think all of us can attest to the fact that we learned a ton through this crash course experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about HTML and CSS programming. Since our app was rather intense in how it needed to be built, all our of us always were looking up how to do certain things, such as using the  module in HTML to make a drawing. Even though we were never able to get our canvas completely working, though, we learned a lot about cross-coding between HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                    What's next for XX Inspire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kat has made XX Inspire her personal project for the upcoming winter break :). We plan to keep working on it as a team too throughout the duration of the school year since we all go to the same school.
