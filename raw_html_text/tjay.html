                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students sell SAT books on the Facebook Groups, but TJay provides an organized website to exchange these resources to benefit the school community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it's incomplete, TJay is meant to transfer educational books among students and in addition, incorporate a tutoring program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a database to store "items"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to using html, javascript, and firebase (firebase being the most difficult), in general, it was difficult to get the code to work without spending lots of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite not finishing, it was great to see the database work and being able to store the values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of javascript formatting and code as well as how to use a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TJay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue working on TJay and hopefully make use of it in school.
