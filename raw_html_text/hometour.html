                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom is a realtor and I thought it would be much more effective to instead of having both the realtor and the client to have to drive out to see each house individually they could just look at a 3d model of the house being sold from their laptop from the comfort of their own house and decide whether they like it or not.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program starts of by showing a satellite view of the map and on that map there will be red dots representing houses on the market, by clicking on that the user will be taken to a google street view outside of the house they choose and from there they can look around the house from the outside, look up and down the streets the house is on or go inside the house. Once they're inside the house our program will use 3d images to create a 3d model of the house and from there the user can navigate the house.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google VR and Unity, we created an Android based application in the virtualization of a room. Many of our groupmates were inexperienced in both VR and the Unity software. Using YouTube and various other sources, we managed to create a camera encased in a sphere in which a 3D image is projected stereo-graphic. In addition, we used multiple scenes and scripts as to act for movement throughout the environment and create a more smooth experience. We then changed the build settings to match those of an Android, tested, and optimized it for use. Thus creating a completely 360 virtual world in which the user can explore.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With little experience in virtual reality as well as the use of the Unity API, we ran into many hurdles throughout our development process. These included passing the learning curve on using GoogleVR within our project. Initially, we were planning on not making our app a VR style app; instead, it would work like Google StreetView. The user is able to look around by swiping rather than physically moving. Fortunately, with the help from mentors and other amazing resources at HackDFW, we were able to move passed this and jump over the other hurdles as well.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first experience at HackDFW has been very pleasant with a great deal of knowledge gained. This project has been an amazing stepping stone where we used our skills from class and parlayed it to a real world situation.

                    This project has greatly excited our passion for Computer Science and its wired variety of appliances. We hope to attend more events in which we can do the same.
