                    This game simulates the process of running for president, allows you to test strategies, and provides feedback.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and Canvas in HTML, as well as data from the arcGIS API for our interactive map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the map in canvas required some effort, and the many islands in some states posed an early challenge. In addition, we had to learn JavaScript along the way.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an interactive map, allowing users to simulate campaigning for political office.
