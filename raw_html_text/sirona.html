                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friends recently went to Nicaragua as part of a Global Brigades health development program. There, as a student volunteer, she got first-hand insight on how doctors spend an unreasonable amount of their time scribbling patient notes onto a piece of paper due, which becomes highly inefficient due to the sheer volume of patients in need of help. Furthermore, after these documents were collected, student volunteers spent several hours uploading this barely legible data online each day. As a result, this process was neither time-efficient nor accurate, posing problems for storing and retrieving medical information.

                    Why Sirona
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sirona is a Celtic God of Healing, which matches our mission of aiding doctors and patients in underdeveloped countries.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first built an android app that uses Google Speech Recognition to perform speech-to-text conversion. This platform then sent that data to a web server that we built. Our web server was run on an AWS EC2 instance, using a Django backend with MySQL to store data. We then served the app data to a web page that doctors can use to view their patient data in a legible and organized manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was bridging the gap between the Android app and the web server. Part of the process that was difficult was creating a post method that could successfully send a form with our input data to the Django endpoint. Apart from that, we faced some challenges like getting the MySQL databases to work with the Django backend and with the Android app to establish a connection with the Django endpoint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Establishing a continuous system between the Android speech recognition and the website database that enhances the doctors' workflow. Furthermore, the fact that we were able to understand each aspect of the project and bounce ideas off of each other to simultaneously attack each issue from multiple sides is something that we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work cross-platform by integrating different development environments successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sirona
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the different types of information that a doctor can store about each patient on our platform. Additionally, allowing multilingual support so anyone in the world can store information easily would be a vital component to add. This idea can be pursued in the form of a non-profit startup in order to expand the reach of this technology and have a real impact on third-world countries.
