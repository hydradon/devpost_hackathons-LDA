                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the increasing divide between women and men in STEM it can often be intimidating and discouraging for young girls to explore the various careers in STEM. We wanted to create a project that introduced young girls to STEM, hoping to decrease the divide and encourage more girls to pursue a career in STEM.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that contains a survey that takes users interests and skills to provide them with an accurate career path in STEM. Apart from the survey, we will provide information and a link to an info page regarding the career suggested. Apart from our survey, our website offers a mentorship program where mentors in the specific career/field  get in contact with users to help plan their futures and guide them on a path to success in STEM.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Our website was built with wix.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Our biggest throttle as a team was organizing our thoughts and coming up with an idea we thought was original and worth creating. SheCan brings together both our passion for science and the strive for equality amongst women and men in the work field.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to take all our ideas as a team with both STEM and non-STEM team members to create a non-profit website/program that could change the dynamic of women in the work field. Taking both our skills of technology and coding as well as marketing, expanding, and creating a plan for our project in the real world.

                    What's next for SheCan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to expand SheCan by partnering with schools across the nation to make sure we can refine our matching algorithms and reach out to as many young girls as possible to introduce and inspire them to go into STEM.
