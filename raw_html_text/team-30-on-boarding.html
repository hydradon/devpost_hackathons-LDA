                    Meet Linda the head of HR, she is trying to figure out how she can improve the new hire onboarding process. One of the feedback she gets is that new hires do not know who to approach and are also scared to approach people since they are afraid that they might start of on the wrong foot. THe other problem also is for the SMEs to be available all the time to answer the queries. Also, she wants the onboarding process to be more fun and self-paced for the new joiness. Hence Linda wants to automate the process and still have a human feel to it. But she also had a mandate from the CFO to keep the cost at the minimal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the on boarding package, Linda decides to give everyone her bot called Linda. Meet &ldquo;Linda&rdquo; who runs on Alexa. She will be your personal assistant and help you with your first day at work.
