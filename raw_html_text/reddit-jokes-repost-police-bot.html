                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try building something different from our usual projects and reddit is a website that we frequent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People on r/Jokes are always complaining that all the jokes are not original and are just copies of previously posted material.  This bot checks the newly submitted jokes for keywords and then uses them to search through the previously posted content.  It then checks for matching phrases before commenting and linking the original joke if it determines the joke is old.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the jraw java library to give our program the capabilities of a logged-in user on the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our new account had restrictions on posting frequency.  This is meant to prevent shill accounts from creating lots of spam, but also slowed down or ability to test it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really cool to see how good a job our bot could do of identifying keywords from big bodies of text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    String manipulation is not something we have worked on before, but I think we now have a much better understanding of it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Reddit Jokes Repost Police Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not entirely sure.  We'll have to wait and see how it is received by the community.  It is definitely possible to extend to other subreddits.
