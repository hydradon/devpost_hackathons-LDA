                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever had problem to communicate with your friends on IRC? Well, we did, as pinging our friends wasn't reactive enough. Now we've got possibility to send push notification to registered mobiles!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server sends push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging. It facilitates managment of these notifications so we don't have to worry about sending information to Google, as the server does the work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server is written in Python using Django(REST) framework. The data about users' mobiles is stored so push notification can be send to all of their devices. Another major advantage of this solution is that many token keys are generated, which can be used by external applications to send notification, additionally giving us information about information provider.
Website was built with AngularJS and Bootstrap. It manages user registration, sending own notifications and generating tokens for external applications.
Android app is simple client which sends mobile's GCM ID to the server and receives push notifications.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making use of GCM, setting up the environment for the website (especially Boilerstrap).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of our 3 independent parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To never give up! In first 24 hours nothing particular was made, but despite lack of motivation at the beginning we made the whole app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for push.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create IRC plugin to send notifications to own's mobile.
Possibly rewrite the server in Haskell using servant and persistent.
??? Create your own app, it's just one line in curl to send notifications!
