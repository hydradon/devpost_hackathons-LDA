                    Designed as the only necessary application for consumers to explore businesses, Proximity is the community amalgamation.  No longer do users need to download one app per business that they like.  Instead, all businesses can house their application within Proximity.    Proximity provides location-based business Adsense and services by using the phone's GPS coordinates.  If a user comes within proximity of a business, that business's custom application or webpage appears (such as a menu or a special discount).  This encourages users to walk to business locations rather than shop online, thus giving businesses better opportunities to provide positive experiences.

                    <em>

                <p>
                    Want to claim your way to fame?  Proximity will provide a second way to claim space on the map.  Users can claim space and show off where they've been in the world by temporarily claiming tiles within a grid and placing any website link.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Claimed tiles are reserved for a certain period of time so the user can show off to friends and passerbys with both images and weblinks.

                    Want to see the Proximity world from above? Grid view would allow users to see and inspect the grid blocks around the area they are standing as a grid overlaid onto a map of the nearby area.

                    ## How to Use
 ### Claiming Land on the New Frontier
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are currently standing in a tile within the grid that is unclaimed, you will see the following icon:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img data-canonical-url="https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/Proximity/blob/master/imgs/claimNewLocation.PNG?raw=true" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--tuGnJqK---/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/Proximity/blob/master/imgs/claimNewLocation.PNG%3Fraw%3Dtrue">
                    <img data-canonical-url="https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/Proximity/blob/master/imgs/enterURL.PNG?raw=true" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--Qj_W1omL--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/Proximity/blob/master/imgs/enterURL.PNG%3Fraw%3Dtrue">
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, you can add in the weblink that you want users to load up when they step into your territory.
                </p>

                    ### Seeing Others' Claimed Land
                </p>
                <p>
                    If someone has already claimed land (and in this particular example, they posted reddit.com as their link they wanted people to see), it would look like this:
                </p>
                <p>
