                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we brainstormed, Roshni remembered her story of when she came from India. An idea formed, and she wanted to code an app that translates between languages. She told us her idea, and we worked as a team to build on it and create a better app than any of us could have alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WX translates speech into text and text into speech. As of now, this app is intended for deaf people who want to understand hearing people. We are looking to expand the app so it will help many differently abled people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by looking into the Google APIs, however, we realized it did not work well for us. As a result, we experimented with java on android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we faced is that we were not able to obtain the speech to speech translation. We realized that as soon we clicked the microphone, the program will not play our sentence back to us. We still were not able to fix it, however, we are optimistic that with more time, and some guidance, we would be able to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment was getting the speech to text translation the first time. It took hours of research and refining to allow us to compute the right code so the program will correctly output the sentence we spoke.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team under a time constraint. We all split the work and worked hard. Yet, if we needed help, we would not be hesitate to ask each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to fix the speech to speech translation. Afterwards, we want to recognize emotions through keywords and facial expression recognization so it can help those on the spectrum and the blind. Furthermore, we want to able to analyze pictures for blind people so they can "see" through sound.
