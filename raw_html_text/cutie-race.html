                    Our original idea was to create a game whose central mechanic was to use a grappling hook.  A heroic spider was to use his swinging skills to navigate its environment and take out its enemies.  However coding the actual grappling mechanic proved difficult, but we were able to create movement not unlike the steering of a rocket in space.  Thus, Cutie Race was born.  By generating a force in the direction of the cursor, we were able to create an interesting method of steering against a few AI racers.  While most definitely not a finished product, it nonetheless serves as a proof of concept which can be built upon in future projects.  For many of us it was our first experience with C# and utilizing the Unity engine and we are pleasantly surprised with how much we were able to accomplish with minimal prior experience
