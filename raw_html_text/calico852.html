                    calico852 outputs stars that display a long-term dimming trend, which is not typically observed on the main sequence of stellar evolution.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the MAST
                    <em>
                        Kepler
                    </em>
                    Field of View search form to acquire all the target stars that were continuously observed by the satellite and were bright enough to have been observed historically. I converted this list into a format that would be accepted by the DASCH website, and downloaded files with all recorded magnitudes for the stars. I ran linear regression on the magnitudes over the observed timescale, splitting the data at 1962 to avoid the confounding influence of the Menzel gap. I displayed the
                    <em>
                        Kepler
                    </em>
                    Input Catalog identification numbers for all stars that exhibited dimming behavior both before and after the Menzel gap.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered difficulty with the DASCH archive request form and opening tabs in the browser programmatically.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to download and work through large sets of data with this project.

                <p>
                    I plan to read the data from the DASCH website programmatically, make a more attractive user interface, display the significance of the observed dimming trend, and cross-reference the outputs with lists of known variable stars and eclipsing binaries.
