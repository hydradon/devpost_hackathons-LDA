                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us have always wanted to invest in cryptocurrency, especially after seeing its meteoric rise in popularity as well as value since November. However, we didn't know how to invest in crypto: what were the best coins? Was there any way to test our investment skills before entering into the highly volatile cryptocurrency market? 
That is how we came up with CryptoEx. CryptoEx allows users to buy cryptocurrencies at current prices, which simulates the current crypto markets and allows users to see how investing on cryptocurrencies would be without actually spending money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users create accounts on CryptoEx and they are given $10000 in virtual money to invest in cryptocurrencies. They can quote for the current prices of cryptocurrencies, or they can buy and sell cryptocurrencies to simulate owning a wallet. Also, if they are running out of virtual cash they can add more.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Flask and Python.
