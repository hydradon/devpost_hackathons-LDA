                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you like to waste time on Reddit and want to do so more effectively? Don't worry, RNA can help!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jokes aside, we built RNA as a tool to improve our Reddit browsing experience by helping us become more aware of what we were reading about. Whether we're reading a text post or browsing the comments section of a linked article on Reddit, it's incredibly important to be aware of what is being discussed, as well as being actively engaged in the discussion. RNA can automatically detect content in Reddit posts and recommend highly-relevant articles to read, allowing us to get a more complete understanding of the post's topic. In other words, our inspiration for this project was largely our commonly felt need to be able to easily delve further into current events. In order to appreciate and understand any given event in the modern day, we want to make sources from various networks and different perspectives available to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RNA parses the Reddit post currently being browsed by the user, and sends a request to the web server to analyze the contents of either the post itself of any linked articles in the post. This information is used to find relevant keywords using the IBM Watson API. Then, these keywords are sent as a search query to the News API in order to find other recent articles that the user could use as related supplemental reading. On the UI, these keywords and articles are displayed, and the user is given the option to narrow down their search by selecting a subset of given keywords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows you to:

                <ul>

                        Learn about other, closely-related events
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find out more details about what is being discussed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify the accuracy of claims being made by commenters

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The functionality of this application is split into the usual frontend and backend components.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Backend:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The backend is built with Python, Flask, IBM Watson SDKs, and the News API. It performs the following tasks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Accepts any URL (including that of a Reddit post itself) to be analyzed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding library to find the categories and concepts that uniquely identify the topic discussed in the linked content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Performs some pre-processing, sorting, and selection on the data to filter out categories/concepts that might not be relevant to the linked content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses the News API to find other news articles relating to the filtered set of categories and concepts, giving content that the end user might be interested in reading
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Frontend:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The frontend is the most critical part of this project since it provides a coherent and seamless RNA experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frontend is effectively a Chrome extension built with React &amp; Redux that is dynamically injected into "old" Reddit pages as a sidebar that can be toggled open or closed. This required the following functionality (roughly in the sequence followed by the extension's logic):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Background scripts to monitor the sites being visited and inject site scrapers into Reddit pages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Content scripts that interact directly with the DOM to find the most important content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Usage of the Chrome messaging API to communicate between content scripts and background scripts on the completion of scraping
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making API requests to the backend for relevant articles and the tags associated with linked/relevant content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dynamic injection of a pre-compiled React &amp; Redux application into a Reddit post
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Usage of Chrome's storage API to transfer fetched data from background scripts to the injected application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A React application to present all relevant articles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Usage of Redux and redux-promise to maintain state application, specifically the articles to show, whether they be the initially-rendered articles, or new ones fetched based on tags. (Redux came in clutch by allowing us to maintain application in a fairly clean manner).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A fair amount of JavaScript and CSS to ensure that the injected application both looks nice and does not interfere with existing content
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into tons of challenges on both the frontend and backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backend, we were running into rate-limiting issues with the IBM Watson API in addition to their servers running slower than usual during the hackathon. Other than that, it was largely a task of data aggregation and making sense of connecting the Praw API, Watson API, and News API on the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the frontend, we struggled to understand how Chrome extensions communicate with the main broswer page, and how content could be injected into the page dynamically based on the results of API requests. This effectively led us to learning about the messaging and storage APIs Chrome offers, although the various roundtrips of communication between background and content scripts got confusing really quickly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is able to do a lot for the user with practically no intervention, making it a powerful tool to become heavily engaged on Reddit. RNA retrieves suprisingly relevant information, so we're proud of successfully integrating several development tools to vastly improve the Reddit browsing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embedding an entire React application into an existing webpage is a bit of a cheeky thing to do, but we're proud of being able to accomplish this succesfully while keeping things relatively performant. RNA also generally works quite consistently, much to our amazement.

                    We learned a

                        ton
                    </strong>
                    about creating Chrome extensions, as well as how to use the IBM Watson and News APIs effectively. We furthered our knowledge of frontend technologies, namely React/Redux and vanilla JS, and how these can be used with a Chrome extension to create something that's more than just a popup.

                    What's next for Reddit News Accessory (RNA)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned on generalizing the information retrieval performed by RNA to more abstract sources of information, such as any news article. This could make RNA more useful by making its functionality accessible in various platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also look forward to making RNA available on the Chrome Store.
