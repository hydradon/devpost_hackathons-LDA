                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning was what initially sparked our interest in stock analysis. However, due to time constraints and limited knowledge, we decided to take on the challenge of using API and Flask for the first time instead.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python Wing IDE for the backend programming logic, and we used Flask and HTML for the frontend presentation.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraint was hard to overcome, due to the endless de-bugging of the programs, especially since we decided to tackle a completely new domain.  However, with much help from the mentors, we were able to overcome many of the challenges.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the initiative we took to complete the task, as well as the learning experience that came along with it.

                <p>
                    We would like to continue to debug the program, as well as increase the array of factors available for the user, and implement more functions in the code to make it faster.
