                    What It&rsquo;s All About
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The &ldquo;spoon theory&rdquo; is a commonly used explanation of how people living with mental and physical disabilities have limited energy every day, and how they must budget that energy across every action they take. We created this project around the idea of explaining that theory using a short simulated day in the life of a person who uses spoon theory, and going through everyday actions, but with the threat of &ldquo;will I have enough spoons later?&rdquo; over the head of the user with every choice made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    From Beginning to End
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went through a few iterations of how, exactly, we'd simulate this life. We played around with some text-based adventures for a while, but eventually landed on something more visual, with buttons and options to pick from as you traverse through this person's day. Using HTML and CSS to create the user's playing space, and creating a little character to draw in various situations as the simulation continues, we did our best to make a nice little world where the user could learn about spoon theory in a calm and beautiful environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Obstacles We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we intended on building a complex simulator using an integration of Python and HTML. After installing Flask through the terminal, we realized it would be best to be efficient with our time limit. We ended up using HTML and CSS only, but still felt we were able to convey the core meaning of our work. Regarding HTML, we felt some obstacles as we were adding animations and links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Accomplished
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, our simple little "spoonie" ended up with a basic yet informative day as they traveled throughout their daily activities, guided by the user, who, at the same time, was learning more about spoon theory and the difficulties of living with limited energy (while we, ourselves, were creating this with very limited time). We hope that, as simple as it may be, this experience provides the users with some new knowledge and understanding on the spoon theory, and how mental and physical disabilities affects those around you in ways you may not have noticed previously.
