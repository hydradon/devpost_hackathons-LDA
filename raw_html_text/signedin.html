                    Inspiration - Our goal was to stay within the target of this hackathon, education, and develop technology that could be implemented for use within the community, specifically with ability challenged individuals, to broaden the spectrum of available resources for learning.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Uses a neural network algorithm to accept input from American Sign Language (and eventually other hand gestures) using a modified version of the Leap Motion API to function in a manner similar to speech-to-text input for verbally challenged individuals. On the web-end we created a community online to educate and discuss.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - There is no 'I' in team, and this was nothing short than a product of Team Machining. And teamwork. We built SignedIN with C++, Python, Atom, Sublime Text, Leap Motion's API, and massive amounts of caffeine. For the web-end we utilized WordPress to quickly and easily create a website that educated interested parties in our product and begin a community around it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - The WiFi was not working, which created massive issues with product development for our team, until the crowds had mostly cleared out at the end of the night and we were massively sleep deprived and starvation had set in and realized a floppy disk would be a better data-sharing method than attempting to utilize cloud services. Retyping the entire source code would take less time than trying to connect to the wifi, so, we just did that.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Despite WiFi problems and other event organization challenges, our team rallied, worked together, encouraged one another, and learned and accomplished an incredible amount in a short amount of time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - As a team, I feel we all learned a great deal and grew together and independently in ways that have enriched us for all our future endeavors.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SignedIN - Our team is determined and committed to continue working on the project after the hackathon is over.
