                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for this hack came from an introsem at Stanford called "Abortion in Fiction" that I am taking this quarter (Spring 2018). Even in the 21st century, maternal mortality rates in parts of Africa and Asia are far worse than those that existed in Europe in the 1700s. While we make medical breakthroughs every day, committing even small changes to the legal jargon and red tape that surround "taboo" topics such as abortion takes a long time to propagate from conception to being available to the masses. This problem is even more accentuated for women in developing countries in Africa and South Asia where the population, sanitation, religious practices and misinformation get in the way of acceptance. This leads to the loss of lives we can save if we have a better way of talking about these stigmatizing topics.

                    Jane Network, like its counterpart of the same name in Chicago in the 60s and 70s is a way through which women and couples who are trying to prevent a pregnancy, unplanned or otherwise,  and/or seeking gynaecological counsel can find certified doctors, medical practitioners, abortion providers and midwives around where they live who conform to the highest level of modern medical practices in order to receive safe and comfortable treatment before things get worse.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to achieve my goals, I deployed two smart contracts written in Solidity on a test network that I created using Truffle and Ganache. In the process, I learned some neat tricks that I can perform with the terminal on my Mac while gaining some super important insights into how decentralized apps work. I wrote the front end using of this decentralized app using a meteor container. I also

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into my fair share of challenges. Initially, I couldn't find a partner and decided to work on my project individually. Since this was pretty much my first time working with both Meteor.js and the Ethereum Blockchain, I had to go through tons of mind-numbing documentation to make a sense of everything. It took me an extremely long time to set up all my dependencies. I also ran into trouble while porting my solidity contracts in a way that they would play well with my meteor code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the fact that I worked twice as hard this week to get a chance to participate in this hackathon. I am also proud about getting a good idea of how apps on the blockchain work in the span of less than 12 hours. However, I feel best about the fact that WiCS has organized this hackathon as a way for beginniners to get interested in problem solving using tech and also thinking about the ethical challenges that surround technology.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that 12 hours was a very short span of time to accomplish everything that I set out to achieve this weekend. I feel great about my knowledge of decentralized apps and how to create/deploy some on the IPFS network. I also learned that I need team members to get work done faster in the future at hackathons.
