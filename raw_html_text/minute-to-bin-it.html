                    Realizing there is often a lack of knowledge about what waste items should be recycled, thrown away, composted, etc., we decided to create a fast pace sorting game that would subconsciously help people become more knowledgeable about sustainability.

                    Gameplay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our game, different everyday household waste items drop into the screen and users must toss them into the appropriate bins: trash, recycling, compost, or electronics recycling. Points are received for every correctly sorted item, and lives are lost for each item that doesn't make it into the correct bin.

                    We decided to build an iOS app to tap into Apple's wide user base and have a chance to learn swift, since none of us have ever had ever tried iOS development before.
