                    KnowPool is an innovative platform where the users can share their programming expertise with the other learners easily via the means of professional blogs and videos. Personally, we think that there is a lot of great study material related to programming, computer and internet in general. However, this material is scattered on various platforms, making it harder for people to get the best content at one place.

                    Various people have various blogs/YouTube Channels and some have dedicated websites for the same. However, it's hard to keep up with these various platforms simultaneously. Plus, there's another factor of switching to various different websites and then getting confused with the content, because of how the data is represented on different platform(s) is different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This creates an unnecessarily complicated Architecture consisting of Modules or Silos. Thus, instead of creating another Silo of this complex hierarchy, we aim to unify and simplify this problem.

                <h2>
                    How Platform Works :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, if you want to learn a particular skill, you go through various websites, or sources to find content with good ratings. Various platforms have various judging criteria for judging the content. Sometimes, there are people who want to share their knowledge about a certain topic, but they find it cumbersome to create a blog/channel/website manually to place their content. We wish to give these users a way where they don't have to go to such lengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whoever wants to share their programming knowledge, they can simply sign up on our platform as a "instructor" and start writing blogs or sharing their tutorial videos on our platform. This way, anyone can teach whatever content they have superior skill(s) in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The learners will have the ability to rate/comment/share those posts. This will also give the new learners a unified review about a particular content source. We also wish to keep this platform completely free, because we ourselves as students believe that education can be free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we will be having a donation section for maintaining server and architecture costs.

                <p>
                    We've used C# (Xamarin Framework) to develop the client-side and on the back end, we have developed our own PHP based APIs to POST and GET the data to/from the database. For database, we've used MySQL.

                            If you're a developer or any user who wishes to test this application and run this android project, it's recommended to install Visual Studio with Xamarin Support and Android SDKs on your system. Remember that Android SDKs should be in your local path for you to be able to compile the project properly. You can find the source code in the "

                            If you do not happen to have Visual Studio, it is recommended to get it because it'll download all the required packages on its own, if they're not present. You can use Visual Studio's Free Community Edition. It'll work, as we've developed this application on it.
But, if for some reason, you don't want to or can't install Visual Studio, you will need to have .NET, Xamarin, Android SDK and required Packages in your system's local path for you to be able to compile and execute this application project.
