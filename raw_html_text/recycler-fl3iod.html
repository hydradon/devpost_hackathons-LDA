                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past, I wanted to recycle more, but I'm very forgetful, so it would always slip my mind. I thought that a good way to address this problem would be to turn recycling into a game. This way, recycling stays at the back of your mind because you're trying to increase your stats.

                    Tracking Count
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I thought tracking one stat well would be better than tracking many poorly, so I decided to just track the number of items recorded at first. It seemed like a good way to see your progress, as it kind of feels like you've "reset the game" every time you empty the recycling bin. Also, I thought that if people knew what items they recycled most often, they'd be more conscious of either find alternatives for that item or making sure that they always recycle that item when it crosses their path (e.g., I know that water jugs are my most recycled item, so I might think about switching to reusable jugs).

                    The idea to add this component came from the sidebar widget "Save Energy by Recycling" on the

                    . I thought it was as a good way to understand the effect of recycling, as hearing that your efforts generated 10-kilowatt hours of energy really doesn't mean much to most people.

                    Put simply, the skill records the number of items you've recycled and how many kilowatt hours of energy you've saved by doing so. It also calculates the length of time that you could power an appliance with your energy savings.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My initial plan was to write a skill that could track a wide range of recyclables without having to hardcode each conversion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought the best way to do this was to collect the item being recycled using two slots. The first would identify the material of the object (e.g., aluminum, paper, plastic, cardboard, etc.) and the second would identify the object itself. I would then multiply the amount of energy generated per ounce for the specified material by the average weight of the input item.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of possible recyclables was too large, so I decided to only support the most commonly recycled items. I flagged these "common recyclables" by doing google searches from the perspective of someone wanting to start recycling. Luckily, there were many blog posts on this topic (
                    <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/how-do-i-recycle-common-recyclables" rel="nofollow">

                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did the same thing for the average weight of the items, no info on this or the common recyclables were in the open source data, but it was much harder to find good information (especially for items like a soda can where you need the "empty" weight). Still, I was able to find a few documents on specific subsets of items (
                    <a href="http://www.aspower.com/aspaweb/bids/RFP%20NO.%20ASPA14.1216%20ASPA%20AND%20PUBLIC%20JOINT%20VENTURE%20RECYCLING-Appendix%20A.pdf" rel="nofollow">
                        Example 1
                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I had the average weight of commonly recycled items and the energy conversion of the different materials, all that I had left to find was the energy needed to power various appliances. Again, this data wasn't in the open source suggested resources, but I was able to find a
                    <a href="http://energyusecalculator.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        site
                    </a>
                    with all the information I needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After collecting all the data that I needed, I then started to write the code to perform the calculation. I used the EPA widget to check my conversion. I tested each item at a time and everything was looking good at first. I had to make small adjustments to my numbers, but it was within the expected error range given my crude methodology. However, when I went back to test all the items one final time, I found that my results no longer matched the EPA's. To make a long story short, it became clear that my formula and the EPA&rsquo;s were different in some non-trivial way.
I pulled the assets being used by the EPA site and went through them looking for the code for the widget. When I found it, I saw that they had an additional variable in their formula named &ldquo;savings&rdquo;. The EPA&rsquo;s formula was clearly more valid than my own, and I wanted users to have an accurate account for their efforts, so I decided to scrap the weeks of work I&rsquo;d done up to this point and use the EPA&rsquo;s method instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still not entirely sure what the savings variable is meant to reflect, so my skill&rsquo;s use became limited to only tracking the handful of items found in the EPA widget. This was a big disappointment, but I&rsquo;m confident I can figure out what this variable represents and add more recyclables to my skill.

                    Utterances
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Because I wanted to make up for having to restrict the kinds of items the skill could track, I wanted to make the utterances extremely flexible so that users could issue commands in the manner in which they naturally spoke; I wanted them to not have to say the word &ldquo;magazine&rdquo; for the skill to pick up on the fact that what they were recycling was a magazine. Continuing the example, I thought that having slot values for all the different top magazines would be enough to accomplish this, but I was wrong. In order for this method to work, I would have needed to add an utterance in the form &ldquo;I am recycling a {magazine} magazine.&rdquo; But then I realized that someone could have the same intent but instead say &ldquo;I am recycling a copy of {magazine}.&rdquo; Even if I were to account for all the ways to say you&rsquo;re recycling a magazine, I realized that allowing this kind of leniency would make it hard to determine where someone who said &ldquo;I am recycling a coke&rdquo; meant a can or bottle. I could code a conditional to catch this and elicit an answer from the user, but this wouldn&rsquo;t be scalable when new recyclables were added. So, I had to give up my plan and force the user to issue commands with a strict structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a compromise for the strict structure, I thought it would be nice to allow users to be able to use brand names to identify items rather than being forced to use a general term (e.g., &ldquo;coke can&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;drink can&rdquo;). I thought this would make the interaction feel more natural. Since finding all the drinks that come in an aluminum can would be too difficult, I decided to look up the most popular canned drinks in the US. This was somewhat successful, but a lot of the top drinks are just alternative flavors of things like Coke or Pepsi. I wanted to get a wider range of items, so I resorted to using google image search to find images of convenient store fridges or super market fridges to get more options to include (

                    Although I did take the time to plan ahead, I feel like if I&rsquo;d planned better I could have saved myself a lot of wasted time. Before I started to collect all the data, I tested to see if my method resulted in the same answer as the EPA&rsquo;s widget, but I only used one item for testing. If I&rsquo;d tested with two, I would have realized sooner that I was doomed to fail and could have maybe used that time to add more features to the skill.

                    A lot of times I found myself getting overwhelmed with the idea of having to account for all possible was to express an intent or the large number of items that can be recycled. But I slowly realized that I could (loosely) apply the pareto principle to this issue. Yes, there are may items you could recycle, but the majority of people will only recycle the most common household items. So, account for that first and then widen the scope over time. I think understanding this will help me with product development for years to come.
