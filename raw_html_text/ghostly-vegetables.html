                    The Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a mysterious island overrun with ghostly beings that hides a darker secret... A traveling peddler arrived at the island to sell precious swords. However, little did she know, there was a hidden lair that belonged to a dragon. He was furious that she was trespassing and used his ghost minions to kill her to claim her treasures as his own. It is the player's objective to discover the secret of the island of how the dragon had cast a spell on the people of the island to turn them into his ghostly minions. To complete the game, the player must save them.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by one of our teammate's drawing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with assets made in Maya and blender, and primitives were coded with html in A-frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so we were unsure about how to approach this project. First of all, it took us hours to figure out which platform we were going to use and what exactly we wanted to do. Second of all, we had to learn how to use A-frame and html. Finally, we had to realistically finish creating a scene with the time we had left and the limitations of A-frame. We were most concerned of using Auteurist because it was laggy and wouldn't render for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really surprised at how much we were able to accomplish when utilizing A-frame to make a VR project in html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use certain programs and that we can actually accomplish a lot in a few hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ghostly Island
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can clean this up so that we can submit to Mozilla's other contest. It would be nice to take this concept and turn it into a mini-game.
