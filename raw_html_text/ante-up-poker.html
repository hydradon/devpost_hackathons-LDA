                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How often are you with a group of friends and someone has the idea to play poker, but alas no one has the cards or poker chips to play with. For us, it happens all the time. That's why we decided to make a fully digital poker game that only requires computer/smartphone and internet access to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole point of the game is to be played with a group of people in the same room (or it could also be streamed via Twitch). One person needs to run the Unity interface, which contains the majority of the table state including the card pool. Anyone who wants to join the game acquires the room code, and then joins via a web browser on any device (meant for smartphones). The group of people then proceed to play a game of poker, with their "face down" cards seen by them on their individual phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All code was done by Ian, all artwork was done by Matt. Main interface was done in Unity/C#, individual player controller was done using php so as to be accessible by web browser. Communication is done through SQL database communication (mainly due to lack of time)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a lot of work, and still has a long ways to go to be fully playable, but to achieve what we have in just this weekend is pretty incredible if you ask me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ante Up Poker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Betting (still not fully done yet but almost), making the web interface a lot nicer, automation instead of buttons in Unity, animations, faster server communication times, more card games including different iterations of poker and blackjack. This game will eventually be made available to the public to play. If you are interested, you can follow @itwbaer or @foundryeprises on twitter for updates on its release :) Thanks!
