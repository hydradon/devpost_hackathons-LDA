                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When going to parties, we always take awesome selfies with cool people that we never see again, so our app allows you to maintain those connections that you would've otherwise lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans faces and gives you links to their social media information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Microsoft API for facial scanning and wrote the app in Java in AndroidStudio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Microsoft API is really difficult to use, so it took us most of the night just to integrate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Microsoft API!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android dev is really dope, and microsoft has really cool APIs
                </p>

                    What's next for WhoDis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're gonna polish it and eventually launch it to the Google Play Store, and one day the App Store.
