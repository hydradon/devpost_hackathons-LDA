                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While driving to Montreal, on just a 6 hour journey, we noticed how a lot of people drive when they're pretty tired and possibly doze off a little bit due to that. Well we won't lie, it happened to us once. We figured that enough is enough! We were wondering why no one has made something this simple yet but we're willing to give the world an antidote for dozing off and risking not only theirs but others lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeDoze is a web-app (Soon to be iOS and Android) that can be built in with camera software or used by it self. It's main purpose is to wake up a driver once he starts to dose off. Most of us mount our cellphones with the car and using its front camera, we use google AutoML which we trained to detect if a driver is drowsy or falling a sleep. It will then attempt to wake the driver up by either playing a song on the radio, or any other mechanism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DeDoze was built with Google Cloud Vision specifically, Google AutoML, php, html, css, javascript for the prototyping purposes of this hackathon. We trained the AI with 6000 images and some special sauce and got great results to detect if the individual is drowsy or dozing off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing GoogleCloud vision on a hosted sever (for which we could'nt fetch data from the AutoML api's).
Using https non https servers were not allowed to take videos/streams directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the IDEA that we generated and we all want to work on it further. Even though it was tough to finish the whole thing within the span of a hackathon, we still intend to take this prototype, improve and advance it further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Machine Learning in general. We also got some additional knowledge about how to implement different API's and dealing with website back-end and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DeDoze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to actually turn this idea into a reality. We feel like road safety is a major issue that should be addressed and we believe that with this initiative we can reduce road accidents by quite a bit. We're hoping to take this idea not only to the Govt. of Canada but also pitch it to the massive car giants to integrate it with their systems as it's a very simple Idea that can save thousands of lives.
