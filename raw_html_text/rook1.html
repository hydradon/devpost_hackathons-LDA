                    So, we wanted to create a blockchain-based software engine that drives coffee machines so customers can create custom coffee configurations, share their creations with other users, and be rewarded for creating popular configurations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Shardus to create our blockchain environment due to its benefits in large, unlimited scaling benefits. This was especially important for us since the coffee market is so huge around the world. We wanted each individual to be their own respective node in the blockchain that would contribute. This contribution would then be awarded according to how much traffic that node receives (in the case of custom coffee, how many times that node's custom coffee is chosen).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was the coding experience we had on the team. We had two freshman CS majors and one MBA. This meant that none of us had ever worked with blockchain programming ever. From the front end UX development to the backend blockchain it was all new. We definitely learned a lot on all fronts. Unfortunately, due to our experience, we were not able to fully integrate everything we wanted. Another challenge was learning node and javascript from scratch which meant that understanding all the Shardus code was also difficult to understand.
