                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI was created in Scratch and the code was developed in Java and XML--using the android platform and IDE Android-Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending data between different intents in the app was easy at first, but required more effort when the app reached 5 screens/intents (Android parlance).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that it works!  That we were able to integrate UI (image files) elements effectively into the overall design and were able to make them interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that structuring an idea before a project begins is very important.
                </p>

                    What's next for Vivian
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would add customized tips in the future.
