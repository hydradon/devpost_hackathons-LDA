                    This is Matthew Bilik and I's project for the StuyHacks VI Hackathon. It is Proximeter, a tool for finding fun events for learning a new skill or hobby. This could influence any individual in a good way because they learn about stuff, and they become more productive, rather than just sitting on the couch.

                <p>
                    First, it finds your location automatically: It does this to ensure that the user can easily reach then event.

                <p>
                    Second, it asks you about one of your hobbies as a refrence, this can make the events appealing to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, it displays a list of events in a neatly styled order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the user can click through the events to learn more about them.
