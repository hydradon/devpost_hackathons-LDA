                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is troublesome and annoying to always download or use external apps to organise projects neatly.

                    Schedulo is a collaboration tool that helps to organize your projects while never leaving your friendly social media platform, Telegram. Schedulo offers a light contrasts to the heavy duty online project management platforms that are often built for big corporations and unsuitable for small once-off projects such as university projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Schedulo organises tasks according to 3 categories: To-Do, Doing, and Done and can assign personnel to their respective task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to Trello, it tells you at one glance what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Schedulo is a fast project management system as most discussions already appear on Telegram and its just a means of organizing the information, without a need to change platform.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we build it using telegram, flask and integrate with a web interface (javascript, html and css) using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges were to learn web development and python telegram bot from scratch, and troubleshooting as well as debugging took the bulk of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew how to make a website or telegram bot, and had minimal experience with firebase. We had to start from scratch but manage to pull through with a working prototpye
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt to do rapid deployment and integration via Github with multiple moving integrated parts such as our web and Telegram interfaces and our firestore backend.
