                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all highly concerned about global warming and how it's been having significant effects around us, so we decided to create a Web Application to tackle that problem. Our idea was to work on local level and bring it to global effect. By sharing bikes within the community we strive to reduce fuel emissions, provide accessibility and extremely low costs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShareYourBike is a 3rd party service that connects the bike-riders and the bikes in a local community using the open system of bikes. Bikes are provided by the community members and for the community members. It creates an online environment for identifying the available bikes and requesting the bike service with only one small time investment of lock. It highly promotes accessibility within the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to combine several features together in order to build this web application. For the map tracker, we had to use JavaScript and Google Cloud Maps API. For the website, we had to use SQLite to create a database to store user information and python along with flask to create the web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coming up with our original idea, we quickly realized it was too broad and that we would need to narrow the scope of our project to make a bigger difference in the community. We had planned to use Python for every part of the project but we soon found out we would have to use many other languages many of which most of us had to use for the first time. We had to go through many tutorials and getting started guides to getting a rudimentary understanding of the languages so that we could get a working demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our first web application that uses a SQL databases. Half of our group used SQL database for the first time. Learning the nitty gritty deals of the Flask API, Google API and covering up every aspect of service was a great team effort. We are proud to contribute to this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to share ideas and feel comfortable in taking in suggestions , being able to learn on the go and not just implement what previous classes have taught us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Share Your Bike
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would build more on the lock system, feedback system and repair system repository. We would add in incentives to the clients who invest their bike for longer term. If there is a positive impact in our community, we aim to reach out to neighborhood communities to reduce fuel emissions
