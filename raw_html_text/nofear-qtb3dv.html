                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leila had a job interview in a famous company, let us listen to her story : "He was the director of a large organization who had just delivered a speech to my college class. I&rsquo;m a soon-to-be college grad who&rsquo;s looking for a job in marketing. And he had a position available that was right up my alley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it turned out, the job was right&mdash;but the situation was all wrong. He, a businessman more than 30 years older than me, was "attracted" to more than just the luster of my intellect, experience, and skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me share with you what happened that day. After his presentation was over, I approached him to ask a few questions about his organization. We decided to grab a table to sit down and continue the conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sat down, and then he took the chair right next to me&mdash;on the same side of the four-seater table. I found it a bit strange, but I continued on with our conversation, which soon turned to the position he was trying to fill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His next move was to put his arm around me. I leaned forward to separate the physical touch and continued with what I was saying. I was uncomfortable, but I wanted to learn more, so I went along with the conversation, pushing his uncomfortable gestures out of my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it didn&rsquo;t end there. As he was giving me his business card, he flipped it over and wrote his home address. Then, he invited me over on the weekend&mdash;an offer that disoriented me so much I couldn&rsquo;t even speak. A few minutes later, as we were leaving, I went to shake his hand&mdash;and he ignored me and kissed me on the top of my head. "

                <p>
                    Our main idea is to build an easy to use application that may reduce the impact of these malicious acts by notifying police and surrounding people who will help in case of exposure to harassment. This application may shake the attacker's self-confidence when he sees people interact with his victim and it ends up generally to arresting him.
