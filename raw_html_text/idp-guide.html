                    An internally displaced person (IDP) is someone who is forced to flee his or her home but who remains within his or her country's borders. UNHCR report in 2018 shows about 41.3 million people in the world were internally displaced due to armed conflict, generalized violence or human right violation. The Nigeria IDP Survey was conducted by the World Bank which compiles a socio-economic profile of IDPs and shows many are affected. As indigene of Borno State facing the pick of insurgency has the highest number of IDPs in the country, our team visited the camps to see the current situations and tried to generically provide solutions to ease living in camps. Findings from the study has however prove that IDPs go through numerous challenges, from shortage of food supply, poor sanitation and health care, to lack of security, and the prevalence of rape and abuses in the camp. It therefore conclude that peace building process of reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction are the most crucial component to resettlement of these vulnerable people. Government and establishments needs to be informed before taking proactive steps in providing the needed incentives and providing security for the IDPs. Our team came up with an App called IDP Guide that provides solution to some of the major challenges facing the internally displaced persons.
