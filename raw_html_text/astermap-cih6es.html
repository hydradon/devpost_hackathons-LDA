                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People don't notice all of the life around their feet as they walk through campus. Astermap increases plant literacy by connecting an Android map to a plant database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can interact with a mobile map that incorporates an OU-specific botanical database. Several tabs, including a functional login feature, allow for future modifications including a game and a genus-search setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app. In addition, we used C# to build an ASP.net API web application, hosted on Microsoft Azure and interfaced with an external Code First database, which also runs on Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every member of our team was new to Android app development, so there was a steep learning curve. We had some difficulties accounting for the differences between the OSes available on Android Studio, and those running on our hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our slick menus, working APIs and functional map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about building apps for Android. We improved our git skillset and thoroughly benefited from conversations with hackathon mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AsterMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can use the infrastructure included to expand our data-populated map into a location-based game. This will bring the enjoyment of plant identification to a wider audience at OU!
