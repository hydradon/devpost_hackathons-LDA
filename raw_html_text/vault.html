                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt it was counter-intuitive for sensitive encrypted storage systems to depend on 1 piece of string - your password.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VAULT allows users to store and access files only from one particular location. This filters out remote threats where unauthorised people want to access your files. It's essentially like your own personal safe at home - neatly hidden away from threats in the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two computing engines on Google Cloud Platform, and integrated our NodeJS server with Cocroach DB via Postgres. We used the extended functionality of Cocroach DB to make our storage system possible, in particular ALTER TABLES without locking the DB as you'd normally do with SQL and Replication safety nets that helped our DB be more consistent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating CK DB was not easy for us in the beginning, but it was rewarding at the same time. A crash course in Node could be developed from learning CK DB. Additionally, we considered building a Desktop app but server required attention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully implementing a SQL DB on the cloud with high scalability for multiple users.
