                    Speech therapy is expensive and there aren't many options available. Our goal is to make an easily accessible, online application that children can use as a supplement to speech therapy. We will be using Microsoft's Speech to Text API to make an interactive storybook that can detect speech issues and help kids work on and fix them in an entertaining way.
