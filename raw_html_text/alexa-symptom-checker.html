                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really drawn to the idea of creating something that could benefit human health and wellness. We were also interested in what could be done using Amazon's Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is an Alexa app that can be used for getting descriptions for doctor medical terminology. You ask Alexa about a word or symptom, and she sends it to the IMO API. The API returns a good description for the term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Alexa Symptom Checker using node.js, the amazon-alexa API, and the IMO API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had every used the technologies we needed for this project. We had to do lots of research on node.js, Amazon Lambda, and Alexa. We also had to ask many questions to understand the IMO API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we made an Alexa app that works and that it has the potential to be useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use node.js and how to make Alexa apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Symptom Checker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of room for improvement with the app. There were a couple features we were really hoping to get to that we were unable to incorporate due to the extensive time we had to spend debugging. We would really like anyone to be able to ask Alexa about their own symptoms and return advice for them. We also had an idea for making this practical for doctors. We believe Alexa could be used to make filling out hospital forms easier. We believe Alexa could be used to save them time by allowing doctors and nurses to fill out patient data verbally.
