                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to solve a common problem faced in interviews , misrepresentation and miscommunication.
Through the magic of technology we have come up with a solution.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app scans for your data from multiple top programming platforms like TopCoder .
Using this data we give you a custom score and using this score we give you a custom sticker which is your AR badge.
Your AR badge can be put on your resume and can display videos of yourself or your projects and also shows your
strengths visualized in 3D. The visualization is produced from the data we gather about you from the programming platforms and data is easier to visualize in three dimensions which makes life easy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity combined with Vuforia and Image trackers to generate data based of the custom image.
We used API requests and JSON to get data from the TopCoder platform.
We then used this data to make a visual representation of your skill set.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting data from programming platforms was hard since some platforms like HackerRank discontinued their API and some platforms does not legally allow us to web scrape their data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn and build an AR app which integrates multiple different components and being able to work seamlessly as a team. Things that were seemingly easy ended up being harder than expected yet we over came all our hurdles.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about AR and how Vuforia works with Unity.
