                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are just beginners with coding and this was our first gaming code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This code is specifically for a few seconds of entertainment to a user who needs a quick distraction from his or her work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of old games like pac-man but implemented a similar piece of code that is easier to operate. (more space to move the rocket ship)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few glitches where the user could go out of bounds but the witch could not. This would defeat the purpose of the game and would be a potential cheat. We used trigonometry and geometry to come up with ways to make bounds for the user's rocket ship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a quick game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can definitely do a more complicated program soon which we will work on in the next 24 hours.
