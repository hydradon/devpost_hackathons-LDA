                    , which discussed how the best way to help people is to give money to organizations doing the work, Spare is built to make it as easy as possible for people to give.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spare donates your spare change to a non-profit of your choice. By connecting your accounts to Spare, the app can
                    <strong>
                        temporarily
                    </strong>
                    store and track your transactions. With each transaction, Spare will round up to the nearest dollar and set aside that change. Once your spare change reaches a user determined threshold, that money will be sent to the charity you chose. The transactions then get removed from the database and the process begins again.
                </p>

                    Plaid's API does not work well with Meteor initially so I needed to dig a little deeper into Meteor's internals and documentation to get Plaid to work.

                    We were happy to get Plaid working with Meteor after a lot of struggling with its API. We also enjoyed learning about and applying some newfound design skills to create a nice user experience.

                <p>
                    Our initial target market is anyone with a smartphone. The average consumer has about $10 in spare change per month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thinking locally, with only 10% of the market in Maryland, at $10 a month we will raise 72 million dollars per year for local charities. According to the
                    <a href="https://mdfoodbank.org/hunger-in-maryland/whats-at-stake/" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    , every dollar purchases 3 meals, so 72 million dollars provide over 216 million meals to insecure Marylanders.

                    estimated that an additional 26 billion dollars per year could provide every child in the world with an education. If only 10% of smartphone users join Spare, we will raise nearly 100% of that goal.
