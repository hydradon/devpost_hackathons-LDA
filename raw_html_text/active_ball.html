                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have motivation to keep our bodies healthier and would like to help more people stay healthy. By playing a fun game, they will access to get information about how much pressure they can handle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This 3D mobile game is designed for players to keep track with their body's muscle strength. The objective of the game is to reach the end of the path by changing the size of ball so it can go through all obstacles. The user can do so by squeezing the active5 device. The more pressure the device detects, the more the ball shrinks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the UI on Unity and running the game on mobile phone on Android Studio, we will bring to the players exciting experience. We use C# to write on Unity and Java and Kotlin to write on Android Studio. Also, we use the library resources that ActivBody provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When processing library sources, we have a challenge to convert from Kotlin to Java to make Java as a main programming language. Plus, when connect Unity and Android Studio, we have to update the newest and compatible version to finish the tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a good team and have learned more about building the game. Also, this is the first time that we build a game that interact with players in both computers and mobile phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use and collaborate lots of available programming languages and resources to build the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Active_Ball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to polish the 3D version for the game and create more challenges for players.
