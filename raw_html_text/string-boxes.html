                <p>
                    Part1)
What: A tambura model (ported to BBB for the hackathon) with physical buttons (to pluck strings) and knobs. 
Challenges I ran into: getting faust to work on BBB, Smooth triggering, CPU usage
Accomplishments that I'm proud of: it works! sounds good.
What I learned: how to code for BeagleRT, connecting stuff to it
What's next: Optimise complete model and have more fun
