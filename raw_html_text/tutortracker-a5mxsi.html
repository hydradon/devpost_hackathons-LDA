                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by how much we used to get bad grades and could've really needed a tutor to help to make our moms proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After you select which course you're seeking help with, it links tutors with tutees in an Uber-esque fashion, showing a list of nearby available tutors in real time, their location, and estimated walking distance. We also used Twilio to create an AI-powered chatbot that users can text to find nearby tutors for a subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had two people working on frontend, two on backend. Used Vue, Express, MongoDB and Node as our stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning on the fly, collectively having little experience in Web Dev apps. Google Maps API had a weird issue w/ billing.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a fullstack without having all the knowledge to do so prior to this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Vue, how to collaborate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adding tutee and tutor profiles.
