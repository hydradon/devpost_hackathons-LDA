                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood is a precious commodity, and everyone deserves to have access to safe blood transfusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around 20% of blood gets wasted, due to careless transport and storage, and in Pakistan only 10% of blood donors are voluntary donors (voluntary donors are considered safer than replacement donors). There is a need for more streamlined processes for tracking and monitoring the journey of donated blood. There is also a need to encourage more people to donate and a need for a publicly available data source / inventory for available donated blood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This a blood tracking application that tracks the journey of blood donated from donation till transfusion. This is an attempt to monitor and log the various changes in ownership and conditions (transport, storage etc) donated blood goes through, to bring transparency to the process for both donors and patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also an attempt to boost motivation for donors to donate blood by making the process more transparent. Both donors and patients will be able to see the path of the blood they've given / received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would also help build a publicly available data source for available donated blood.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Smart Contracts in Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js, Drizzle, Truffle, and Ganache
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is actually the first hackathon we have ever participated in, and this is also the first time we worked with blockchain. In fact, we didn't know anything about Blockchain, Ethereum, Solidity etc before this hackathon started, and we still have a long way to go. We ran into a lot of issues as a result, in both understanding the underlying concepts and in hacking our way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time was a little on the short side (practically speaking we had 24 hrs to do this), and more coding related guidance would have been super helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to understand this paradigm, and development environment to
                    <em>
                        some
                    </em>
                    extent, and that we managed to come up with an innovative idea and implement it to some extent. And we're super happy that we finally got to participate in a hackathon, and are definitely looking forward to participating again.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a technical perspective we learned about Blockchain, Ethereum, Solidity etc. We also learned how dive into something completely new, and grasp the essentials in a very short amount of time.
