                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to be a king. Not necessarily in order to wear a crown and have a nice throne, but to be able to say orders and they would be done. Now, this vision comes true. Just text your
                    <strong>
                        Concierge
                    </strong>
                    (butler, assistant etc) what you need to have done and, within limits, this will be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The base idea was to
                    <strong>
                        connect people
                    </strong>
                    who need simple services like cleaning, car repair, plumber services etc. with sole traders in order to help the people get their stuff done and on the other hand to give competitive advantage for suppliers who have a hard time competing with huge firms already dominating the market. The idea evolved to incorporating all different services like cab calling, flight booking, and ordering food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is only and as much as a chat. You text the virtual Concierge who then analyses it, agrees details of the order with you, and the service in its way. The whole magic happens in the background where the server is looking for contractors for your order and makes all necessary arrangements.
