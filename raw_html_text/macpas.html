                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help patients in need who struggle with ALS.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the press of a button, the app scans through sets of letters. After the assistant receives an indication from the ALS patient to select a button (ie. with the blink of an eye), the app then allows the patient to select the desired letter using the scanning method again. The purpose of this app is to draw on the manual aspects of partner assisted scanning but in the form of an app. The app also includes features such as text to speech and letter correction.

                <p>
                    We were not only able to learn Android Studio in less than 48 hours, but we also created a functional app that meets the requirements given by Hotel Dieu Shaver.
