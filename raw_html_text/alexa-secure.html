                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the lack of accessibility to affordable and easy to use home security systems.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our "hack" notifies a homeowner if their home has been breached when they are not home.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the twilio API along with AWS S3, AWS Lambda, and we constructed a physical Arduino circuit switch to detect when the door is opened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making outbound calls through the Twilio API has caused us some problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really happ to say that we've succesfully brought the hardware and software together to make an easy to use, affordable home security system. By using the Twilio API in combination with Amazon Echo, Amazon S3, and our switch circuit we've constructed, we were able to solve a real-world problem - something we're really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Secure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created the foundation for a successful product that someone could feasible bring to market. In the future we hope to add an additional app to allow the homeowner to turn off the security system remotely as well as other features such as the ability to listen to recordings by Amazon Echo. There is also potential in adding more skills to the Amazon Echo such as an audible password request.
