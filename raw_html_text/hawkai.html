                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    6 hrs on learning how to compile with dependencies. The rest was built on "free" electricity and Wi-Fi.
We took a bottom-up approach to building it. At least we think we did.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Lack of detailed Java API for Telegram

                    We managed to produce a working bot that is close to deployment.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How scrub we are. How inexperienced we are...

                <p>
                    Improve on data completeness (we lack price ranges, menus and opening hours, etc)
Providing access to such data that we lack
