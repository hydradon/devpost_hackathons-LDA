                    Finding an Airbnb isn't an easy job. Especially if you're planning with others, going through tens of hundreds of listings before a trip can be exhausting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two biggest concerns we always have when we look for Airbnbs is the price and what type of listing it is. That's why we built "The Price Isn't Right"!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've developed a chrome extension that automagically finds the current listing you're looking at and runs machine learning classifiers and clustering to give you the predicted price of a page and the classified listing type (with 5 types - "Modern", "Luxury", "Tourist", "Homey" and "Quiet").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Predictions and clustering is based on the Seattle 2016 dataset - so far it's going to be most accurate for Seattle Airbnbs!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        A quick dip into how we made this:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our chrome extension calls the Airbnb API every time someone is visiting a listing page and clicks our chrome extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We parse this data and feed this into our pickled classifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our price prediction is based on a few selected and engineered features from our dataset, fed in to a Gradient Boosted Regressor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our clustering also feature engineers data that we think would be indicative of a "cluster" of listings. Next we use a one-hot encoder to encode our features into a sparse matrix of one-hot vectors which we use feature decomposition (more specifically singular value decomposition) to further decrease the dimension of the dataset. Then we feed this into a Agglomerative Clustering algorithm to label our results (we used 5 clusters). Since this is a transductive learning algorithm, we need to feed these labels (and our original data) into a linear simple vector classifier in order to make a classifier that can make predictions based on the data we have.
