                    Much produce is wasted all over the US and this produce could be put into better use. Many children go to bed hungry and we wanted to reduce this amount of waste and the number of hungry with our hack. Our hack connects businesses and charities so these businesses with extra food will be able to donate this food to charities. We built this web app using Director, a TJ interface, that allows users to build websites. We used Javascript and SQL for the backend and HTML and CSS for the frontend. We ran into many challenges along the way and had to modify our idea as we went along. Some things we are proud of is the ability for users to register and login successfully. We learned that much planning is needed before starting a hack. For FoodShare, we hope to finish up our original plans in the future.
