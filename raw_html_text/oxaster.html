                    During natural disasters, emergency phone lines are often overloaded with call volumes beyond their capacity. This can affect the ability of first responders to prioritize and identify individuals who have the greatest need for assistance and arrive in time. Often, during situations like these, affected individuals will utilize social media to broadcast their predicament. The information posted on social media, if utilized correctly, can then be used to augment information acquired from pre-existing lines of emergency communication, and that why we need

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses a framework to get tweets containing some keywords, inside a circular area which has a center and a radius as parameters.Then it filters the tweets using Azure Text Analytics API, which extracts the sentiment of the tweet, and keeps only the positive ones and plots the areas related to the locations collected of the victims on the map using Goole Maps API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostely in front-end, no one had a lot of experience with that, and also we realized that the lack of realtime information turns out to be a core issue to many problems, because the Twitter API has a limit of requests per 15 minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The search for tweets &amp; sentiment analysis using azure, and integrating the google map on the website ( WE DID SOME FRONT, YEAY ! )

                    Twitter API, Azure, Google Maps and mostly to have fun and discover the spirit of a hackathon.

                <p>
                    We will try to add a mobile app, which would be more practical for a volunteer and the dashboard would be used to send notification for them.
