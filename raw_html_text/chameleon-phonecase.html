                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The phone case makes up a large segment of the accessories market. People buy several phone cases each year to match their outfits. We wanted to reduce the amount of waste produced by creating one device that people could alter to match their mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a phone case that has a screen inside that allows for the user to alter the image displayed on the phone case.

                <p>
                    We built it with a raspberry pi.
