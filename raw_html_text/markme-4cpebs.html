                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my classmate and friend, Mark went missing last Sunday, we felt hopeless. We didn&rsquo;t know where he went or why. We wanted answers and the community could offer them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bermuda Police (with a team of a mere 5 detectives) received hundreds, almost a thousand tips from the public, but commented how hard it was to sort what was credible and helpful in this time-sensitive search. They conceded most tips went to waste in the investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Mark was found dead on Monday and we still don't know what happened to him.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -JavaScript for FrontEnd, Node.js to help shift to backend 
-Google Cloud and MySQL for backend database
-Used the readings from Preceive API to perform sentimental analysis on certain tips
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We never received an authentication key from the API we wanted to use, so we had to create tips and test them through their online demo which took forever
-Connecting the front end to the backend on a hosted server was not easy and we were debating the best way to do it
-SAPUI5 was going to be our first move, but we quickly realized it didn't fully encompass what we needed/wanted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    -This product was made for a real life scenario and it actually has the potential to make a difference. We are proud that we have something of a potential demo to see if there is interest in this specific industry

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    -When the going gets tough, the tough get going
-Went to a few workshops and uncovered the power of React.js framework
