                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cardiac arrest can come out of nowhere. From statistic gathered from 2017, 46.1% of those incidents outside of hospital had bystanders performing CPR with only a 12% survival rate. We wanted to create a way for a bystander who hasn't has great training to be able to help. Our vision is that we want it to work for all kinds of medical emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rescu-AR uses augmented reality to guide someone who has never used it through CPR and AED steps to try and save a life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vuforia API and Unity for the main application with some C# running to provide logic to the augmented reality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our group had done augmented reality before this project. We also had no clue what project we were going to do when we showed up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a life saving device. Learning augmented reality and seeing what was just an idea flourish into a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality, C#, Unity, Vuforia, 3D object creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rescu-AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand to multiple emergency scenarios so that we can save as many people as possible.
