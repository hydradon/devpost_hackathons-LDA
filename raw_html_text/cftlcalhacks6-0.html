                    Ford Focused
Ford Focused is an app which uses Ford's Sync3 API to determine statistics about a driver's driving quality, while also pulling data from HERE's API to determine statistics about the area a driver is driving in. The result is an app which can help drivers adapt to changes in speed limit and other outside factors -- all built into Ford's native interface.
