                <p>
                    We have always seen that the TA's are not in the resource center during their office hours. We created this app to make it efficient for the students to know if their TA will be available in the resource center and the students don't have to waste time by coming to campus if they are not already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used raspberry pi which is our middle man to check in or check out the TA's . TA can just come in the src and use the app to check in or check out which uses device's bluetooth to find the raspberry pi. This is a single click process which is very easy to follow based on our UI. We have also set a range for the raspberry pi bluetooth to 3 meters, so that no one can check in from outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user's can see/search for their TA's since the data get's updated real time. We have also made a web platform where users can simply go and find their respective TA's availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our raspberry pi device doesn't allow pairing with devices so multiple users can check in or check out at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that this platform will be really useful for the students in different departments and save a lot of time for everyone. We have many more future goals with this project.
