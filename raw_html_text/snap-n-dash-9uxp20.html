                    Snap 'n Dash was inspired by an experience we shared as children: imagining a character running across rooftops, car tops, and other obstacles. We wanted to make this experience a reality by allowing users to seamlessly create a strategy platformer game based off the world around them. Our project employs many different resources, primarily utilizing the Google Cloud Vision API, Unity, and Android Studio, all of which were resources most of us were not familiar with. We played to our strengths though: half of our team dealt with developing the platformer on Unity, and the other half focused on using Google's Cloud Vision API to find specific pixel coordinates in photos that could be used as the basis for the platform stages in the game. Our plan was to complete our respective halves and come together on the Unity-Android Studio integration, but we faced innumerable challenges and valuable learning experiences on the way &mdash; not all of which were surmountable. We managed to fully polish and develop the Unity Platformer and write an efficient algorithm to properly collect object coordinates, but since none of us had experience using Android Studio nor integration between Unity and Android Studio, we ended up being unable to fully finish the project as we had envisioned. Still, although the two halves were not completely bridged, our app still possesses the skill to consistently create platformers when manually fed coordinates using Google Cloud Vision, and we plan on finishing the final stretch of the project once the hackathon ends.
