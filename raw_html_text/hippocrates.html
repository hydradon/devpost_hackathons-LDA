                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to
                    <em>
                        speed up
                    </em>
                    the communication process between patient and a doctor and also get rid of redundant tasks, such as having to go to see a doctor to get a prescription to medications. We also wanted to
                    <em>
                        shorten the waiting times
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a
                    <em>
                        chatbot
                    </em>
                    which is the first communication interaface between the doctor and a patient. It is not a replacement for a doctor, but instead a tool which saves time.
