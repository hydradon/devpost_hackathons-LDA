                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to realized this project by a discussion 1 year ago. We discussed this theme about by google example. Instead of informations represented by most linked webpages we decided to replace it by a trust-network.
In our scenario the concept of trust-network is included in news  ( or more how we get news ). 
News today are mostly common by a few media moguls like rtl group or others.
In this condition news are more preselected by editorial staff and a lot of news don't reach the ordinary audience ( for example in tv ).
One of this news were the xenophic attacs in south africa a few months ago. There were no news about it in german tv.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is about a trust-network where everyone is allowed to post news and everyone is involved to verify this kind of news. The end consumer designs his own 'newspaper' and decides from where he or she wants to be informed and by which people.
By deciding from where he or she wants to be informed and by whom news become a completly new plot in society.
Everyone is upto this point responsible for themsleve how he/she gets to be informed about what is happining in the world.
The technical part about it is to trust an author or not to trust him/her  and to select from whioch country you want to get news.
