                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SBB was looking for a way to increase Swiss participation in their rail system. They wanted to incentivise parking the car and taking the train.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a visual indication, using a light, of whether a parking spot has been reserved. This reservation is done through online through a web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used proximity sensors connected to a LoRaWAN to indicate if a car was in a parking spot or not. This data was then utilized by the web application through an API. Clients can then see how many of their desired parking spots are available. Once a client has made a reservation, this data is then transmitted back through the LoRaWAN and used turn on a light that will indicate to those who are not using the web application that this parking spot has been reserved.
                </p>
