                    A global epidemic is taking the world today is chronic stress affecting young professionals, especially in cities. Long hours, stress and lack of sleep, all lead to lack of productivity and burnout. Often, these professionals find it difficult to even leave their own office, let alone finding a park during their break; therefore, our team wanted to create a peaceful, tranquil setting for the user to recharge. With nothing but a VR headset and access to our website, they can be transported to a virtual heaven without major disruption to their daily lives.

                    To begin with, a concept was conceived through our own experiences. As students, we can relate to the demanding time and stress pressures of today's life. On top of that, lack of money makes it difficult to find the resources such as wellbeing instructors/classes/holidays to unwind.
Therefore, this concept really appealed to us, and, as a matter of fact, everyone we shared the idea with got really excited.

                    As a team, we achieved a landing page developed with html/css containing user profiles developed with php/sql to create unique users. Furthermore, Unity and MakeHuman were used to develop the Virtual Reality environment and the avatars that would appear in the simulation in order to provide mentoring about wellbeing exercises (at the moment, the possibilities are endless).

                    The future looks promising and we are keen to have feedback from our users for unlimited prospects.
