                    sed is a unix utility for transforming text. It provides a simple programming language for matching and replacing text. Given its limited features, it was never designed as a general purpose programming language. However, it is an extremely versatile tool and can be used to solve problems way beyond the domain of simple text transformation. This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a maze solver written in sed.

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is a breadth-first search expressed as a cellular automaton. The rules of this automaton  are simulated using sed's substitution command.

                    That's the high level overview. The actual implementation is challenging and ended up messier than I would have liked. The main difficulty lies in the lack of the luxuries usually provided in a regular programming language such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        arithmetic
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        data types other than strings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        more than 2 "variables"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Also, sed regex lacks features present in other regex systems such as PCRE (non-greedy matching, lookaheads, etc).
