                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having gone through the painful experience of losing our friends to suicides and depression, our team wanted to prevent friends and families of potential victims from such unfortunate events. The number of suicides in Singapore rose 10 per cent last year, with suicides among boys aged 10 to 19 at a record high. Inspired to address this societal concern, we ventured to find a way to sieve out potential victims, so they can receive help promptly.
Social media platforms are commonly used for the expression of suicidal thoughts and feelings, particularly by young people. Hence, we decided to tap on this open platform to help save the lives of youths in need.

                    Parents can monitor their child's emotional state simply just by entering their child's Twitter username. Our bot will sieve out their posts and run through algorithms and check it against our database of keywords to rate their emotional health. This will give parents a good sense of how well their child is doing. For critical cases, we will flag them out and advise parents to seek help immediately.
