                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that finding coupons online can be very difficult with many tedious tasks to perform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack scrapes coupon websites using uipath and javascript, and uploads the coupon information with links in a user friendly form. Information includes expiry dates, prices, and restaurants. Additionally, the data can be sorted by price, restaurant, key word, or expiry date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with UIPath to scrape data from coupon websites and then write the data to a csv file. Our website would then read from this file and then display it in an organized manner with the help of other technologies such as flask, beautiful soup, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on the project as a team had technical conflicts such as code sharing between multiple devices. We solved this by using github to streamline our code-sharing process.
Additionally, the learning curve for problem solving in unfamiliar languages such as java script proved to be difficult. Specifically, sorting the prices in different ways was a problem solving endeavor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our product is something that we could actually use in our day to day life. We were able to build a useful and effective software with little time and a team with little experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students with little work experience, the biggest learning experience was being able to apply our programming skills to build a useful application. By applying our skills in our own unique and creative ways, we were able to solidify our current knowledge in computer science and even gain some experience in technologies we have never experienced before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fast Food Haven
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to eventually host our website on a domain and have the option to add more restaurants to our coupon list.
