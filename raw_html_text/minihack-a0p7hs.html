                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and another software to get the code made.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a lot of work in 3 hours and got something nearly done. I think the pressure and the teamwork made us get better at code.
