                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a personal experience, after a night out, I gave my DD the wrong address on accident and had trouble flagging him down. The next morning I wondered if there was a more efficient way for DDs and riders to communicate their ETA, location, and contact information more easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hammrd is a user friendly interface that connects organizations, drivers, and users to share information quickly and easily. The app displays organizations the User is a part of as well as upcoming events they plan to attend. During events, users are able to easily message their location to DDs by clicking a "request ride" button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using Android Studio and the accompanying website was built on Sublime Text Editor using html, css, and bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our team members has any significant experience with app development, so there was a bit of a learning curve to overcome. The internet issues throughout Bitcamp made collaborating over GitLab slow and impractical so we waited until the last moment to merge our work. We also wanted to use Amazon Web Services to host our website and store user data but we had a bit of trouble dealing with the wifi and using the $100 AWS credit provided by MLH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 36 hours, it was hardly feasible to implement all of the methods we would like to see in this app but we did manage to connect our app to the Google maps API and successfully set up the driver/user ride request messaging system. We are excited to have produced these functionalities on an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Divide and conquer. Understanding that we would not be able to fully implement our ideal version of our app from the start was crucial in us being able to have enough of a produce enough of an application to demo today. We also have a better understanding of our team's dynamic and each member's coding strengths and weaknesses. This has helped us become a more productive team that learns from one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hammrd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hammrd is only in its beginning stages. We still have to fully implement the user profiles, add calendars to track event information, establish a database to track user information, create a ride queue for the drivers, and more!
