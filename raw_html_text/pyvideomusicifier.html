                    Procedurally Generated Music Videos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PyVideoMusicifier is an application that converts arbitrary input video
into a music video based on the accompanying song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How Does It Work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main processing techniques used in PyVideoMusicifier,
fourier analysis and beat detection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Fourier Analysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fourier analysis allows us to look at the spectral content of the video.
From this spectral content we can figure out what the maximum magnitude
of all the peaks are. From this magnitude we can adjust the brightness
of the video to correspond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Fourier transform is also directly visualized in the video. After
sampling the transform, the samples are overlayed on the vignette. This
allows certain musical effects to be seen as well as heard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Beat Detection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beat detection allows us to figure out at what timestamps beats occur in
the target audio file. From this list of timestamps we can grow and
shrink the vignette effect that is overlaying the video.
