                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think Bitcoin is pretty cool so I wanted to build something based around it, and spent some time looking through the blockchain API. After my research I was particularly interested in the interactions between foreign exchanges and bitcoin exchange rates and decided to build something around this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bitforex is a tool to visualize the interactions between foreign exchanges rates and bitcoin exchange rates. It pulls in real-time currency and bitcoin exchange rates and uses these to present you with profitable or unprofitable exchanges from bitcoin through multiple currencies, and back to bitcoin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decided to use flask for the first time since I wanted to work in python and I also wanted to learn it. I used the blockchain API and yahoo finance API for real time exchange rate information, and the front-end uses the jinja2 template as well as HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was using flask for the first time I came up with lots of "hacky" fixes that are far from elegant. The backend algorithm was a bit difficult to test due to slow internet and fairly long loading time when making API requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built something that looks cool, that I think is cool, and involves Bitcoin. Those were my goals going into CalHacks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about flask, a lot about bitcoin, and a lot about how much better I am at coding after a 2 hour nap!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bitforex
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add in lots of data visualizations so users can get a more visual way of observing forex/bitcoin interactions. Also speed is a slight issue, so I will look into better API options for pulling realtime foreign exchange rate information.
