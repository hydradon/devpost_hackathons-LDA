                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weariness of being asked what the value of each chip color is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its intent is to allow the user to set up a basic home game of poker by keeping track of time and the chips in play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end was developed through Node.js which is hidden by the HTML and CSS in the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into technical debt and not integrating back-ends soon enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of presenting this web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that for tasks such as this, it would be imminent to set goals at certain times to create a more finished product.
                </p>

                    What's next for easypoker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully becoming a fully developed web app that works as expected.
