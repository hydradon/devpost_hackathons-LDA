                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion's unique hand tracking technology allows for the opportunity to create new ways of interacting and interfacing with a game. Utilizing this technology in an interactive, two-player format adds to the experience through an immersive and novel approach to gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game relies on Leap Motion as an input device to build 3D-shapes using specific hand gestures. The conditions of the game involve providing one player with a random word and having the player construct the item using the Leap Motion. The other player attempts to guess what the constructed shape is supposed to represent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built using Unity at its core. Leap Motion API and networking were utilized for the input and the two-player aspect of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking and syncing the two clients together simultaneously was troublesome. Creating the unique gesture language and mapping them to specific actions also proved to be a challenge.
                </p>

                    What's next for Shapable Arrangements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having more than two players, rotation of player turns for drawing, more gestures mapping to more actions, further refined gesture language, and add more customizable shapes
