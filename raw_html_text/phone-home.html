                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For those times that you just want to go home. No need to check anything yourself. Phone Home calculates the best ride and gets you on your way. Inspiration to predict when you need a ride from thinking about how to use Sense360
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your home address is estimated form Sense360 or you can enter it manually. Open the app and the best ride is calculate. All you have to do is request that ride. Phone Home only integrates with Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Flywheel, EZCar, and Via currently. Text based (thanks to Twilio!) predictions on when a user may need a ride is calculated server based on the average amount of time a user is usually at a location. Phone Home will text the user 5-10 minutes before we anticipate them leaving. Timestamps of when a user uses Phone Home at locations is also taken into affect to determine when to text them.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple watchkit isn't that great to work with yet... Will need to find a better implementation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! Sense360 data is stored so the API can tell when to send a text message at the time we expect a user to leave a location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple watchkit development is fun... jokes.

                    What's next for Phone Home
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better Apple Watch implementation when watchOS 2 comes out. Add more Ridesharing apps! Leveraging Sense360 even more to extend the app to rides to and from work based on a user's calendar.
