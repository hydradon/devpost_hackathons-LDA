                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration of this project was to improve the software design skills of our group members
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has 2 main components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game component is a simple minesweeper game that runs inside your terminal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI player component uses a local optimization algorithm to play the game at a high success rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both the game component and the AI player component were written with Python3.7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole project was designed and written within a span of 10 hours during the Local hack day event at UTSC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing the strategy and method to win the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Translating the mental algorithm into concrete implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adjusting to poor design choices made earlier in the project's development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The moment that our AI player won the minesweeper game was a moment of pure satisfaction and joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we all came together and complete the project before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that rushing project design in the earlier portions of development proved to be a poor choice, due to all the troubles it has cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a valuable lesson for all the group members and we will work to improve our designing skills in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for minesweeper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to improve and polish the algorithm to increase the win-rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to polish the game further and create a better user experience.
