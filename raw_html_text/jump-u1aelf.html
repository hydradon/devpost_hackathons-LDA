                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to make a generic game with a twist
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It counts the number of times the player has jumped, and increments the difficulty of the level by the amount of times the player has jumped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Piskel to create sprite sheets for animations and sprites, and Unity for the bulk of the game creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with coding character movements, and switched from an initial idea with 3D rendering to 2D rendering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding a game is hard; we should bring more programming experience to hackathons, and stick with an idea that we like.
                </p>

                    Solo development(?), possibly 3D rendering
