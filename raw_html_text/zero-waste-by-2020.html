                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by UCLA's commitment to sustainability (hence the title) as well as efforts from the city of Los Angeles to provide citizens like us a healthier environment to learn and grow. We also wanted to create something that we could apply to kids in a cooler way to encourage them to be eco-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a 2D scrolling platform shooting game on Unity. The user will play as a robot who has to destroy all remaining trash in each level (representing a different part of LA) and collect recyclable materials. Each level also comes with a special fun fact about sustainability goals in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and wrote scripts in C#. We also designed our own video game graphics with online drawing/editing software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group had little to no experience with Unity to begin with, so part of the challenge was learning how to use the software. More specific challenges we ran into as we were implementing our game included putting everyone's contributions together into one working project, since some elements were either changed or destroyed in the sharing process. We also had a ton of bugs when scripting, because we were new to that (and C#) as well. While the algorithms themselves were straightforward, translating our ideas to C# and Unity's tools were difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we managed to learn completely new software and create a finished, working project. Our original graphics are adorable and really add to the spirit of our game, and some of our scripts were tricky to implement but we managed to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bunch! On the technical side we learned about how to code for a lot of different elements in a game using scripts. Some of our more difficult aspects of this included making the text appear as if it was automatically typed, and undefined behavior when dealing with collisions between our sprites. Additionally, we had to develop other important skills such as working under pressure, communication between group members, and making big decisions on the direction our team would take, both about the project and us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zero Waste By 2020
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to fine-tune the project and fix minor kinks in our code that still existed at the time of submission. We also want to find more ways to use the game to educated people.
