                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our lectures about IP routing.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The network starts with just two computers connected to each other. Gradually, more machines are added and connections are made and broke. The aim is to tell each machine how to connect to each other machine by giving it the next hop. But too many dropped packets and it&rsquo;s game over!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A combination of very bad programming practices and even worse ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted to use Haskell but the maintainers of the game library I wanted to use hadn&rsquo;t updated it in such a long time that it didn&rsquo;t want to install. So I fell back to Lua.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying awake for two days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various parts of the love2d game library

                <h2>
                    What's next for Routing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most likely a big rewrite and then some more features to make it a fun game.
