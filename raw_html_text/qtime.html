                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were frustrated at modern trip planning tools and how complex it was to plan for a vacation. The motivation behind taking a vacation is to relax and get away from work, yet the intricate planning required defeats the purpose. Additionally, there is often pressure to visit as many attractions as possible, and much effort is put into determining the most optimal ordering of attraction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QTime is a website that takes in start/end times and position of a trip and automatically generates the most optimal path to partake in activities based on user-indicated interest. Once a path is generated by a user, he is given a unique key which he may use to retrieve the path in the future. QTime also has a built-in share function where the user may share the path with other people via email.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the entirety of the backend using Node.js. Firebase was used as the database system to store and generate unique keys for paths. For the front end, we used vanilla HTML and CSS.
