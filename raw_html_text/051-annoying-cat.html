                <p>
                    There was a cat blocking our way while we were walking along utown green, and we found it cute yet annoying since it distracted us from our task of getting Starbucks. However, since it was cute, we forgave it.

                    Magically conjures up cute cats to block your view, and prevent you from using the site. Seriously annoying, but still cute enough to forgive. (We hope they are cute enough for your high standards, we tried our best).
