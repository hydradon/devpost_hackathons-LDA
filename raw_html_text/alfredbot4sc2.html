                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch itself as a platform was an inspiration. It provides an Interactive experience to its viewers and streamers. Viewers can digitally interact with their streamers live. With game matched extension now this digital interaction could be made more specific to the content of the stream. In
                    <strong>
                        StarCraft
                    </strong>
                    2, a strategy game, a player has to handle multiple functions at the same time, like building new structures, building new more powerful army units, attach enemy units, expand and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blizzard has published a library that helps in building SC2 bots. This was another source of inspiration, which got us thinking what if the Bot instead of being unmanned, could be remotely controlled by viewers from Twitch extensions. The streamer can play along with the Bot against an opponent. Hence, viewers also become a very core part of the gamers journey through StarCraft 2.****
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The streamer installs and starts AlfredBot(Twitch based Desktop App). The bot is then used to start SC2 in controlled mode. Now the streamer can play SC2 normally while the Bot also active is listening for commands on streamer's channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The streamer enables the Twitch Extension for AlfredBot on their channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Viewers can now issue commands like build Pylons, Assimilators or Cybernetic Core engine etc, from the Twitch extension. These commands are published and AlfredBot running on streamer's machine executes them live in game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the streamers can delegate some responsibilities in the game to their viewers.

                        First challenge was, how to interact with the Python program running SC2
                        <strong>
                            from
                        </strong>
                        Electron(NodeJs) code. Solved using RPC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Responsive Design of the extension UI.

                    <li>
                        A GraphQL Subscription Client in python. There were no mature solution available. So created our custom library for subscribing to the new commands in Hasura GraphQL Engine.
