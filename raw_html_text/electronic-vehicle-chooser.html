                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people choose their EV to help them to live a green life etc.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The EV chooser helps you pick an EV.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react front end with a Flask backend to enable python ML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regarding connecting the front end and backend we had a lot of difficulty because there were issues installing flask correctly in the virtual environment, and the path variables were not being set correctly. Additionally, we did not have enough data to train our machine learning model, so it proved to be difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud of setting up the back end and front end, with a machine learning model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to basically deploy a machine learning model on flask and react.

                    What's next for Electronic Vehicle Chooser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to get more data and then make it more full fledged.
