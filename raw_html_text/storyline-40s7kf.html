                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to unite people in an interesting and weird way. People love to share stories, it's just human nature. Many different mediums exist to tell a story. However, most popular mediums today are told in the perspective of one or a few people. What if we could change how stories are told?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Storyline is an iOS application for creating stories together. The powerful aspect of Storyline is the ability for people from all over the world to create a unique story. It completely changes the storytelling experience. People on the platform each contribute to a small part of the story. Therefore, no two stories on the platform will ever be alike. Storyline brings the power of teamwork to the forefront, allowing people to each share their different perspective on a story. Not only does the the application bring people together from all walks of life, it provides entertainment for those interested in reading the stories. In addition, Storyline includes a user curation system so that people striving to tell the best stories can widen their audience. Ultimately, Storyline celebrates the collaboration of people and the artistic value that can be generated by bringing people together.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire application is written in Swift 4 using Xcode 9.2. In order to support the content generated by the users of the platform, Firebase is used as the main backend infrastructure of the application. The application is meticulously designed in Sketch (by our head graphic designer) to provide the best user experience.
