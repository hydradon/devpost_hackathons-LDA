                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, we look for new ways to study with new people. Campus Connection is an amazing way to meet new people and learn misunderstood concepts from class.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Campus Connection allows students to find a study partner on their campus based on scheduling preferences and courses.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python's Flask microframework for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front end. To tie it all together, we set up a local database with MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The virtual environment and database configuration was different on all three of our computers, which made it difficult to push new changes to Github. As far as features go, we had a lot of difficulty with setting up a user interface in which students can select times they are available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two members on the team are first-time hackathon hackers. We are also proud of being able to build a functional web app in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate as a team using Github, how a functional web app connects throughout the entire stack, and database design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for campusconnection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build it further at Rutgers University and implement a calendar feature in which users can visualize what times they are available with other users. We also want to explore using MongoDB as the database infrastructure, which we were unable to do under time constraints.
