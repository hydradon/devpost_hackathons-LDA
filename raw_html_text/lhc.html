                    Hello, we are called LHC! LHC stands for Learn, Help, Connect! We started off with wanting to tackle many challenges, but we struggled to find the right idea that could correspond with all of them. We originally started with an interactive HTML website which would feature minigames where you accumulate points that resulted in canned goods collection for natural disasters. As much as we tried to go through with the idea, none of us knew how to code in HTML or JavaScript and we worried about false sponsorships to support people in need. With no progress done for implementation, we decided to try Facebook Messenger Chat Bot,

                <p>
                    We planned for the AI to crack jokes with the user. After hours of research and failed coding, we went completely out of the box. We knew that the concept, and our abilities would allow for us to execute our idea, so we went full steam ahead to create a mobile app focusing on mental health. No one except Jia Yu had knowledge in dealing with Android Development nor Java in general. The rest of the team learned how to utilize and implement Android Studio, as well as some XML coding to bring our idea to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After hours of creating our front end and receiving mentorship for hours for backend in API, we were finally able to come up with a product that we are very happy with and hope to expand in the near future! To get our final product, we coded and designed our application from scratch under a strict time limit. Even if we may encounter crashes and bugs, whether our project turns out to be a success or a fail, we are definitely proud of ourselves for learning so much and creating such a beautiful application that we think is totally aesthetic and inclusive!
