                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR sword combat can be improved to make up for the lack of force feedback.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Causes sword and arm to detach from actual arm position. This forces the character to regain control of sword and arm, which effectively causes the player to be blocked/parried as if there were force feedback.
