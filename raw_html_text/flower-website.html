                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that botany is the future of this generation. We as humans have to take care of the plants on our Earth which is why we believe that this site will educate others about the future of our world. This is what inspired us to take this beginner project and submit it as an entry. Although it is very simple and basic, we believe that we needed to spread this information with the public as it is vital to human survival.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is made for the purpose of people to learn more about different types of flowers in our world today. How it works is that there is a picture of the flower that is under the heading. Next to it, the user will find a link to a website (please note: those websites are not ours, they are simply off of Google) that is all about the flower under the heading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the hackathon, we attended workshops that were offered. We have never coded before, except for one of our members who is in a CS course, so we picked up all our knowledge from there. Hima, one of our members, actually started the website as a learning experience which we then turned into the final project at the very last minute. We used both HTML and CSS in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aren't a very experienced group of people. In fact, our least experienced member started the project on her own. It was a bit of a challenge to make this look as a standing website. We also did not have a lot of time as we decided to submit it at the last minute because we strongly believed in the cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we took knowledge we acquired at this hackathon and put it into something that will change the world for the better. We believe it is a very informative website and it will tell people about the importance of the plants (in particular, flowers), in our world today. We greatly appreciate and cherish the chance to share something we're very passionate about in a new way that we've recently learned and hope to master.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should probably start our projects earlier next time because we'll have the basic knowledge to do so. We also learned how to use HTML and CSS is a setting where it is actually useful and where we can make an impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flower Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to learn more about different types of software (such as JS) so that we can make our website more professional along with interactive. We really believe that this is something that will impact society greatly if implemented in the right way. We also wish to add more information as well as more features on the website which will reinstate the message we're trying to get across.
