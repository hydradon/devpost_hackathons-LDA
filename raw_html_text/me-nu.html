                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever ate out at a new spot and been unsure what to order? Don't want to have to turn the waiter down to ask for more time to look through countless yelp reviews all recommending different things? 
Or are you at a spot you've been to before? We wanted something that would take our custom preferences, past reviews, and perception of past meals we'd eaten and find us an optimal order.
                </p>
