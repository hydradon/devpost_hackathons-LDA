                    Inspiration- All of us experience the problem, of time management. An interactive time management app is something we wanted and needed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- Our app creates a schedule for you and changes based on your interactions with the app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- We used Android Studio to make this app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- One of the really time-consuming parts were when we had to build each box for each digit for the timings on the user's schedule. I couldn't copy and paste the format of the boxes because that messed up the alignments, so I had to create and format each of the 65 textboxes one at a time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- We figured out how to get an input from one activity and to convert it into a variable to use it in a different activity. Coding buttons to progress to the next activity proved challenging at first too.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- We learned how to add buttons on an app screen. We also learned how to use variables.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moment Management- We aim to introduce the concept of smart schedules in our model, and add push notifications in the future.
