                    <code>

                    </code>
                    : calculates a blob diff of two files. Unlike in "standard" diff, there's no preference given to lines. Output is in JSON.

                <p>
                    By normalizing input and computing changes against known texts, you can use
                    <code>
                        ∆diff
                    </code>
                    to calculate the likelihood that a certain text is plagiarized
