                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although Canada has free health care, it can be very difficult to meet with a doctor regularly and moreover many people find it difficult to start and adhere to a Nutrition Plan. By being held accountable to their Doctor, we hope to increase the chances of the patient sticking to the Doctor recommended regime, while streamlining the communication process as much as possible. Our goal was to create an app that not only helps a patient stick to a Nutrition Plan, but also provides them with support and guidance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website also allows doctors to track their patient's progress while on the specialized Nutrition plan. The App allows patients to access their Doctor's recommended Dietary Nutrition Plan on a day to day basis. The application also tracks their daily nutritional intake and compares it to their personalized nutrition plan. The application also allows users to create a grocery list to encourage compliance with their doctor's recommendation. The App also recommends healthy recipes using ingredients found in your refrigerator.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a brainstorming session on Friday evening, we divided tasks among team members. We built a SQL database - using the PostgreSQL database engine - to work as the link between the Website accessed by Doctors and the App which Patients use. We built the android app in Java using android studio and simultaneously built the website using html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After connecting the Website to the Database we found that, we were unable to connect to the database using the traditional Android Studio method. We then attempted to connect the database to the app using alternate solutions such as calling an API however, due to time constraints we were unable to finish this step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time hackathoners, we are very proud to produce a working Website, Database, and Application without any prior experience in App or Database development. We all individually learned a lot, and as a group are very proud of the progress we made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As well as technical knowledge such as programming in Android Studio, or sql; we learned the importance of dividing tasks and individual time management. We learned a lot about using a database in connection with a website or app and the challenges and benefits that it provides.
                </p>

                    What's next for FoodMD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FoodMD has a bright future ahead of it. Our next step is looking to hook the database up with the mobile app and provide increased functionality for both Patients and Doctors.
