                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to make a 2D platform game because 2D games are amazing and easier to make than 3D games
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that requires you to collect a key and fight enemies and get to the door at the end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're amazing, nothing can stop us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game that works and it has a player that is a ninja cat but it also moves and shoots so it's pretty cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to hate on unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ninka
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly adding a boss at the end and maybe different types of ammo
                </p>
