                    I came to this hackathon not knowing what to expect and what I was going to learn. At the beginning of the day, I started off slow, and wasn't really sure about what I was doing. When I entered my second workshop; Intro to Web Development, I knew I was going to have some fun. I really enjoyed working with GitHub in the tutorial, and decided to challenge myself by creating my own website independently. I was unsure of what to make my website about, and just decided to use my french project as inspiration. I expanded upon the workshop and researched different codes to make my website fit me.
