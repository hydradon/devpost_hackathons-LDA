                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People cares about wellness and health and we want to eat healthily. However, It is very hard to keep a balanced diet and it is very hard to not over consume some nutrients while under consuming others. Having an app for daily usefulness to keep track of our nutrients and food intake would help guide us in the right direction for a balanced diet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft-Cognitive-Services-Swift-SDK to take a photo and recognize the food and query the database for its nutritional value which is kept track of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python for the backend and can query databases for nutritional information received from Nutritionix api. We have an iOS mobile app for the front end which uses Microsoft cognitive services to identify foods we eat and communicate with the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our first time building an iOS app and learning swift in a really short term while making connections with servers using a mobile phone. Also, incorporating the photo recognition into the mobile app was a difficult process to effectively implement. The Cognitive-Services sometimes can not distinguish the food project we are trying to take from its background and give a very broad concept. We need to make sure the right angle to take the photo in order to have an accurate recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Effectively implementing the photo recognition of front end development was arguably the hardest yet most rewarding part of this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing in iOS app and how to create a Server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chiron
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate recognition of foods as well as options for more user input. On top of that, more options for health information as well as lifestyle recommendations will be implemented at a later time.
