                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought the Oculus Rift was way too cool not to try to make something for, and stress is something that impacts people daily. Combining the two, we came up with Oculax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oculax essentially utilizes the Oculus Rift to help relax people. Through the use of the Muse headband, the brain activity is scanned to determine how relaxed someone is. This can be used to help the future of VR technology and its functionality  beyond video games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a ready-made Android app by Muse that collects the brainwave activity. The data was then sent to a node.js server ran through Cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The VR code was extremely complicated. Oftentimes, it had little to no documentation. The Java application also would not send the data to the node.js server. However, the node.js server is 100% functional. We could not figure out how to connect the Java app to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were amazed that we were even able to make the node.js server. None of us had an experience in writing any of it, so the fact we had a functional one running was cool. The learning experience was the biggest accomplishment of all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Oculus Rift is currently very difficult to use. There are many bugs in the code and there are few examples available. Also, the general experience of a hackathon was a learning curve. After staring at code for 12+ hours, the fatigue hits you like a train.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oculax
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oculax is extremely viable. If given more time, it has the potential to be a piece of technology. There is ample  psychological research that can be done.
