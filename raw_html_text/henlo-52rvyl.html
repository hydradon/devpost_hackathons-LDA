                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work on a civic hack.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a Slack app that sends a user a response for onboarding when the user types "henlo."

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a tutorial for using the Slack API, we used Node.js, and the Slack API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of challenges. We took a long time to decide on which project to work on. Eventually we decided on doing the civic hack. We wanted to find a way to use the Slack API to send direct messages to new members but we could not find much documentation on how we can do that using the Event API. We tried building off of the pre-existing channel messaging but it did not work. After many attempts, we decided to stick with channel messaging. Then we worked on formatting the JSON message. Every time we made changes, we had to rely on one member to test the changes as only he had access to stdlib. We also needed to redeploy/reinstall the app in order to see the changes take effect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to explore and work with the Slack API and learning a bit about Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about proper directory organization from the tutorial. We then learned how to use the organization and where to make changes. We learned about the Slack API and looked through some of their many events they support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Henlo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to delve deeper into the Slack API, possibly take a new direction and change the implementation of the app.
