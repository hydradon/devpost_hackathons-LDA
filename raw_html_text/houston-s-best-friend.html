                    Inspiration: As a dog friendly office, we wanted to design and develop a website for the City of Houston that showcases dog friendly patios and parks.

                    What it does :A single page website that filters all the dog-friendly restaurants and park in the city of Houston

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Finding current data.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  We got it done in time!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: You sometimes have to call the city for current data, but they were VERY helpful.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Houston's Best Friend: We plan to add more photos &amp; maybe an instagram feed that picks up on selective hashtags like #houstonsbestfriend.
