                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heart disease and hypertension are two of the biggest killers in America today. By providing an affordable, easily implemented program for study of heart vitals, lives can be saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device predicts blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), calculates heart rate, and displays a 3-lead EKG.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Purchased an Arduino kit and EKG arduino PCB. Using a clothesline clip with a hole drilled in it, we implement a laser and photoresistor setup to quantify levels of absorbance through one's finger. This can be used to predict blood pressure (in conjunction with published datasets in scientific literature) and is coordinated with the EKG arduino, which relies on three electrodes to develop its waveform image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a profound lack of documentation when it comes to using Arduinos, so we struggled to integrate the Python and Arduino environments. Furthermore, we experienced a great of inconsistency with the blood pressure device itself because of light bleeding in from the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we managed to develop a device that takes computationally intensive and technologically sophisticated methods and implement that at a simpler level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are multiple ways in which to assess blood pressure and bring down resource costs for routine heart checkups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Increasing Accessibility to Heart Vital Measurements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to increase the accuracy of both the EKG classification tool and the blood pressure detector in order to make it  usable in the real world.
