                    ER - # The Meal Wheel (mw)
This app is designed to generate a random meal based on one's chosen range of meals. 
The current scope is limited to meals in canteens in NUS, where we found that many students often find it difficult to choose what to eat, given the wide variety of choices.
Wheels are categorised by canteens with the respective meal offerings.
