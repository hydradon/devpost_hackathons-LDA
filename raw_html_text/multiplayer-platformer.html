                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puzzle games like Portal, Platformers like Super Mario Bros.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Photon Unity Networking to connect ten friends to race each other to the end of the level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity game engine to build the level and physics. We used Photon to make it multiplayer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we planned to export to mobile to end with a cross-platform, mobile, competitive multi-player game. Unfortunately due to challenges in getting mobile input to move the characters, we were unable to export to Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the technical knowledge we gained in intensively using Unity for the first time. We also effectively split up our time and effort among a team new to Hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of technical knowledge in using the Unity game engine, and how multi-player gaming works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Multiplayer Platformer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully with more time, we can effectively export to mobile devices. We will use the experience gained at Hack Western to implement more games and participate in teams effectively!
