                    With more and more inexperienced drivers, driving can be dangerous. NavSafe aims to return the safest directions between you and your destination.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the data provided by ServiZurich and navigation routes provided by Arcgis, NavSafe gives alternative routes to streets which have a high proportion of bad driving.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system has been created in GraphQL using the Apollo framework running Serverless on AWS with an API Gateway, Lambda functions and CloudWatch. The driving data was converted into JSON, and the locations at lower levels of driving are mapped as barriers. These barriers re-route the navigation, so the car cannot drive through them unless it's the only path to the user's destination.
                </p>
