                    inspiration: We got inspiration from our day today experience to come up with ideas of this project. For example; seeing a foreigners having trouble understanding the the direction of route in NYC when they don't speak English.Also,
                </h2>
                <p>
                    having friends who speaks a different language and can't properly express what they trying to say because of their primary language isn't English. Additionally, having friends in social media who doesn't speak the same language as you but still can be able to chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does: So basically the way our web app "Speakly" works is when two person speak two different language. and they need an interpreter to translate their language, through this app they will be able to communicate without having a third person involved in the chat because  whatever one person write , will be translated into other person through that person's preferred language. And then when that person replies, it will be anti translated to the other person's preferred language.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    #why is that unique:  our idea is unique because it allow two person communicate with their own language even though they will not able to understand each other's language at all. It's unique from goggle translator or Alexa or Siri Because you will literally seeing the response of the other person in your preferred language as if that person is speaking a different language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:  we used react as our js as our language and used goggle API as support .
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: We had few challenges whiling developing the app which wasn't that major.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We came up with an idea in just 1 day ago and we were able to accomplish it together and that's the thing we are proud of. It was really fun experience for all of us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: we have learned teamwork as all of us are from 5 different colleges and we were able to coordinate perfectly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpeakLy: For now due to having limited time, we have only 2 languages that works with our app.later on we will have all languages can can the translated from one language to others.
