                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about New Story's struggle about offline data transfer and felt we could develop an app that help ease this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is able to create new families for New Story's project. The data is stored locally in .csv format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original intent of the project is to create a SQLite data form in the Andriod port and send these data to cloud MySQL. However, we have problem implementing this feature because it required proficient knowledge of backend and PHP development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team with no experience of Android development, we finished a functioning app within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android, SQL, UI
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Look to implement SQL feature and data retrieval into Android port.
