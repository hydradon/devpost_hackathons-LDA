                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired from the most recent Microsoft Cognitive Service announcements on BUILD17, we intended to take out one of their new end points for a spin e-commerce:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We apply reinforcement learning to increase the conversion rate in e-commerce. By analysing the click behaviour together with the historic conversions, we learn about the intents of potential customers on the booking portal weg.de. This enables us to better predict and anticipate the interests of potential customers and show them more relevant offers in an meta online shop environment that immediately adapts to your likings and explores new strategies to increase sales.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Monetisation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see the technology as a key component in unlocking revenue through Big Data Analytics. From utilising advanced A.I. in an traditional operating areas such as booking portals we expect and increase in revenue of several percent.
