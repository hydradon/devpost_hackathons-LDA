                    What it does

                <p>
                    Each of the 5 food categories are listed. People can use the stepper to mark when they eat a serving. The label becomes red if they eat to much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image of the food (ie bread or vegetables) become more opaque as the user comes to completing their daily needs for that category.
