                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was wondering if a game would go on sale, decided to find out

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicts how likely it is a game will go be on sale in the future

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logistic regression machine learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unicode characters that were not English, steam developers not standardizing 
We wanted to make it predict on a certain day what price it would be, but we would need access to data we couldn't get
                </p>
                <h2>
