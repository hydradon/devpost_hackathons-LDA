                    A Google Assistant Bot that automates interactions with the Zagster bicycle* SMS bot to help save money.

                    *Zagster is a company that operates bike sharing programs for cities and universities. Zagster bikes are secured through a Kryptonite lock that is unlocked through the use of an iOS or Android mobile application or text message sent to a Zagster operated SMS service.

                <p>
                    This Google Assistant application will only work with Android devices.This Google Assistant application is only used to its full potential when the user has the Yearly Membership Plan or One Month Pass. This Google Assistant application will only work as intended when the user does not plan to lock up his or her bike during his ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Problem I'm trying to solve:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the user has a yearly membership plan or one month pass, he will notice that those plans only grant them free rides that last a maximum of 1 hour before he will start to get charged $3 for each additional hour he has the bike. Now, Zagster doesn't count simply locking up their bikes as ending a rental. When using the Zagster SMS bot, which is noticibly faster than Zagster's mobile app, users need to type "end" after starting a ride to end the rental. As you can see, users who are in a rush will oftentimes forget to end their rides, which most of the time means that they will be charged money. The creator of this application believes that Zagster profits off their users lack of awareness. This application essentially solves this problem and enhances the user experience by allowing a zagster bicycle to be started via Google Assistant and automatically typing "end" to the Zagster SMS Bot.
