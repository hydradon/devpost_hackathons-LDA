                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that we were getting scammed on Amazon for certain products that we wanted because when we looked at the changes in price over a month or 3 months, we would see that the prices fell by as much as $5 or $6 from the average. We wanted to figure out if there is a way to predict price movements based on the price history of the product in order to save money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Price Predictor takes in an Amazon link, finds a price chart associated with the product corresponding to that link, and uses LSTM, a recurrent neural network, on the price chart data to predict the price of the product a week later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Heroku and Flask to host our model and website, and Python to create the neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Flask and Heroku to work together, and getting the model onto the Heroku platform
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a functional website that can perform the train and prediction operations on price history data
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding it to more products (for now, we tried only a few products that had a varying price history), exploring different neural networks to better increase accuracy, sending an email/text reminder to the user to tell them to check Amazon for an updated price
