                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a full repo for any projects that need revision control is way too complicated for the uninitiated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users who have no idea how to use revision control the ability to have a small version of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++ on Linux Mint, this allowed us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Qt Creator was a bit a challenge at first, but after that it was really the fact that I was in a trail by fire
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of the fact that at the start of this weekend I had no idea about the basics of C++, Qt, or nemo were and now I can add C++ and Qt Creator to my tool box, and I can add some pretty neat features to my linux flavours.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mario: C++, because I have never used it before this weekend. Also Qt and what it brings to C++, along with what signals and slots are.
                </p>

                    What's next for Rehistoric
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next big thing would be cross platform functionality to have versions for both OSX and Windows.
