                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been hearing a lot lately about food insecurity, especially in our community. We feel like tackling food insecurity as a whole is hard, so our system breaks down the problem into simple actions that anyone could take such as making a one-time cash donation, donating food supplies that are always in demand, or volunteering their time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system helps people in need find local pantries, and helps community members donate their money, food, or time to these pantries. Additionally, you can create an account to become a Food Friend and receive updates from the fight against hunger.
                </p>

                    How We Built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application with Android Studio, and use the Google Maps API for locality.
                </p>

                    Challenges We Ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was making sure we all had the same versions of Android Studio and Gradle installed such that our project would build on all our devices.
