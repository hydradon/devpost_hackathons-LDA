                    Provides a fun story to read, with subtly hidden dino-facts. There is also a quiz, testing your knowledge of said facts.

                <p>
                    I started with BlueJ, using Java. However, I am new to java, and while I knew what I wanted to make, and that it was possible in python, I couldn't figure out how to do it in java.
So, after several frustrating hours, I figured, better the devil you know, right?
So I switched over to Idle, and wrote my code with python.
At 2:30AM I looked at my watch, looked at my code, and decided I needed a nap, So..... I went and got myself more coffee, fizzy drinks and sugar. Good times.

                    Sheer exhaustion causing silly mistakes, like not closing a while loop, so I crash the text editor (which in turn crashed my laptop), like, a lot.

And some completely useless dino facts.

                    Better graphics.
Somehow linking the story and the quiz so they are in the same program and run from one into the other. I'm sure this shouldn't be as hard as I'm making it.
This could be used as a fun teaching method for primary school aged children. You are more likely to remember information that was delivered in an interesting way, than a boring way. For instance you remember the characters in your favourite story, but you quickly forget the names of people you met somewhere boring, like ... I don't know, I don't go to boring places. But it took me 8 years to memorise the names of the people in my church who I saw every week, but I knew my favourite story chacters (like Frodo).
Anyway, what was I talking about?
Right. Interesting delivery of facts. Also, being quizzed after reading something creates pathways in the brain called recall pathways (I may have made that up, I'm not sure).
So interesting story with hidden facts, plus quiz.... equals remembering stuff. YAY!
