                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the
                    <em>
                        Association For Safe International Road Travel
                    </em>
                    along with few other global surveys, there are more than
                    <strong>
                        1.3 million
                    </strong>
                    accidents recorded every year, which implies every month on average more than 100,000 lives are lost. In-spite of major enhancements in technology, we still witness such casualties because of irresponsible driving such as being drowsy, distracted, drunk and many more.  We identified the necessity of a
                    <em>
                        cost-effective technological model
                    </em>
                    which can prevent accidents and also be accessible from low to middle class sections of the society.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our prototype is a
                    <strong>
                        creative, compact and cost-effective
                    </strong>
                    solution which can seamlessly prevent dangerous accidents in commute by intelligently alerting the driver in
                    <strong>
                        lethargy and distraction
                    </strong>
                    using Computer Vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used a
                    <strong>
                        facial landmark detector
                    </strong>
                    to identify facial features in order to extract
                    <em>
                        eye and mouth regions
                    </em>
                    , which are the main identifiers for a driver to be lethargic and distracted respectively. A couple of major libraries namely
                    <strong>
                        dlib
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        open-cv
                    </strong>
                    in python are used to build our solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Distance
                    </strong>
                    between the
                    <em>
                        upper and lower regions of eye
                    </em>
                    is used as a parameter for assessing lethargy. Distance between upper and lower lip is used as a parameter for distraction (continuous speaking or such). Calculation of above statistical parameter that is distance, in order to get the eye-ratio and mouth-ratio was a daunting task.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully accomplished the working prototype of our intention, along with nullifying the challenges we faced for parameters extraction
                    <strong>
                        without using any sensor.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have explored the realms of computer vision and realized how the similar thought-process can be extended to other use-cases which could be very fruitful.

                    We plan to deploy the complete prototype on a single-board computer like ORDOID XU4 and make a portable and commercially viable product.
