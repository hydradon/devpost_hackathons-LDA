                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that there are over 10 million people in LA and not all of them are natives like me so I wanted a more personable way for people to connect with than friends and family for special events specially when their away from loved ones.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used iOs swift with the help of a bunch of videos and a few Hack attended that made sure this first timer coder was able to create her first app
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! I literally came with just and idea hoping to form a team and ended up not getting one. So I have to watch code tutorials and learn for myself.

                <p>
                    I did not give up. I represent a underrepresented demographic in the tech world I couldn't throw the towel in no matter how bad I wanted to.
