                <p>
                    Our solution is based on the idea of a system that comprises of a unique ID and proximity sensors. Briefly describing the solution, the cameras capture the unique IDs on the containers and transfer the data to be processed by the processor in order to differentiate the products. In addition to this, the proximity sensors detect the distance to the last container in each row with the help of the processor to output the inventory levels of each row. In the entire, refrigerator or cooler, a camera and proximity sensor on each row work together with the other aspects in order to output the necessary information constrained by the goals of the system.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    The system continuously measures and updates inventory count and the types of product that is placed in the cooler.

                    Does the retailer/bottler/distributor have to do anything different to make your solution work? (if yes, please explain)

                <p>
                    The system is a non-invasive and non-destructive solution. They system should seamlessly integrate with the existing infrastructure.

                <p>
                    Our system consists of a processor, cameras, proximity sensors, a unique ID placed on the products, and an output screen.

                    Best guest on cost to implement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on an estimation of the costs for a 8 row, 5 shelf  cooler, a working prototype for the entire cooler would cost about $1442. This cost can be scaled down to about $100 to $200 upon mass production based on our conversations with the Coca-Cola Company.

                <p>
                    The main challenges our team faced were primarily sensor related due to our minimal experience given our Mechanical Engineering background.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and gained experience in working with various sensor technologies. In addition to this, as it relates to the problem at hand, we discovered that an ideal solution would be efficient, low-cost and easy to implement in existing and new coolers.

                <p>
                    Continue to refine our prototype in order to compete in the Georgia Tech Expo. In addition to this, we are also awaiting confirmation of our provisional patent, which we intend on further developing.

                    It has been a fun and educational experience working with The Coca-Cola Company this semester in order to provide them with a solution for a real-world dilemma.
