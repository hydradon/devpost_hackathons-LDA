                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a multipurpose bot with various functionality bringing together multiple tools and APIs one would never expect to be together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a machine learning regression model that predicts toothpaste cost, a text-based chatbot to brighten your day, an alexa application to provide additional monetary assistance, and a financial application that helps individuals manage their money better with some fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each focused on different parts of the project then integrated them together to create our final projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all the Different APIs proved to be very complicated.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us are first time hackers, so it was a brand new language and brand new experience for many of us.
