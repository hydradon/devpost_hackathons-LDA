                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired through a real life experience here in Pakistan there came an accident in which two people lost there life, due to vehicle belonging to a culprit of the past where the policeman shot the wrong person  because the person who was driving the car bought it from an unreliable source  -- the car  had several penalties, and the person became a victim, so this gave us an idea why people are buying cars without any prior knowledge to what sort of person it belonged to .. in short the previous owner would have been a good person but what if it's previous owner did something dirty and that came later to the current person -- so that's where it call came to be we thought why not maintain Vehicle history and help verify the vehicle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product helps verify and maintain a chain of owners
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it by thinking of multiple case seriousness this product of ours was vary vast we had to limit it into a single module for now only ; and that's verification only
                </p>
