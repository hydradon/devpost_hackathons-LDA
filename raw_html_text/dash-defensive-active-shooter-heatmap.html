                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The unfortunate reality of domestic terrorism affects hundreds of Americans and their families every year. Oftentimes these crimes are perpetrated using firearms. We believe there is a way to alert the community of active threats with higher accuracy and lower latency, with the goal of keeping students safe when tragedies occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DASH works by detecting gunshots using witness mobile devices, which are then used to provide timestamped geolocation data to build a rough profile of an active shooter's location. This data is then displayed to users of the Android app via an embedded map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application was created in Android Studio using Kotlin and the Google Maps API.
A serverless API was created with Azure Functions to handle the backend logic.
We built it using Kotlin / Android, and JavaScript on Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial location accuracy with GPS caused a lot of issues due to compound error.
Audio recognition of gunshots proved difficult due to a lack of previous experience with machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A novel solution for determining location within a building using WiFi access points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team members got to learn Kotlin / Android, the Google Maps API, as well as Azure.
Brainstorming about active shooter situations broadened our perspectives regarding potential defense mechanisms and triangulation techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DASH - Defensive Active Shooter Heatmap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more sophisticated algorithm could be developed to take into account additional statistics which in turn would increase the accuracy of the location model.
