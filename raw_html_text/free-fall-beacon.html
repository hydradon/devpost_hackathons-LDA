                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the pilots might panic or be unconscious to not be able to send out a SOS to the emergency channel.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project will detect when the plane is in free fall and about to crash.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Arduino 101, we hooked it up to a bluetooth module to send data over to an android phone. It sends the coordinates of its current location to the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting started with android studio and receiving bluetooth packets. 
Making the google maps api work with our app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making our first android app. Getting the arduino to detect free fall and shock from a crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting started with android.
Git
Android 101 and it's IMU interfacing.
Bluetooth from adruino to android
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Free fall beacon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full scale for this project would be a device that takes black box data (ground speed and altitude) along with its IMU data and determines if it is currently experiencing a free fall that might lead to a crash. This device then would send signals out to the emergency broadcast frequency with its current location and a SOS signal.
