                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to motivate you to complete your goals, we looked to add a gamification layer to Todoist. David loved using Todoist the past two years, but felt it lacked a 'motivation factor' that would encourage you to deal with your ever-growing lists tasks. TaskBanisher is about making your to-do list more fun and satisfying, and helping you rid your kingdom of tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TaskBanisher allows users to add quests in order to knock down to-do lists. As users complete tasks in their quests, they earn points and level up. In addition to completing quests, users can customize their hero and give themselves a righteous title.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came in knowing very little to nothing about the technologies we used. We split up time reading documentation on using the microframework Flask for building a web app, pytodoist for making API calls with Todoist, sqlalchemy for interacting with a database, and Bootstrap for setting up the basic layout. We tried to quickly organize a schedule and divide tasks, and frequency collaborated on each other's pages and feature requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all pretty unfamiliar with Python, so the biggest challenge was getting started working against a sea of syntax errors and other weird aberrations. Our dev environments also took an annoyingly long time to set up due to complications with the dependences needed by the app on Mac, as well as a weird partitioning error setting up an Ubuntu VM. We also spent longer than we wanted on using Flask forms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton in such a short time! We all built understanding in each of the areas of technology used to implement the project, like Python. We put together something that we are proud of, and it actually works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are fun. But building something using new-to-you technologies is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TaskBanisher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Quests page can use a lot more work. The user should never have to interact with Todoist when using TaskBanisher. Additionally, we had goals for Duels and Badges in addition to the Quest layer of the game that would really enhance the experience.
