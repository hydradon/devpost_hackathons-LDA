                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sexual assault is a serious problem that may cause life-long trauma if appropriate help is not provided. But, many victims are unaware of the resources that exist to help them report offenders and recover from such traumatic experiences. We have designed a personalized and effective AI that directs victims to the right resources and empowers them to stand up against sexual assault.

                <p>
                    Our friendly chatbot can provide information about Title IX, especially in the medical and counseling perspectives. Through asking questions, it tries to understand the user's needs and gives them advice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the chatbot using Google's Dialogflow, and we embedded it in a website made through HTML and CSS.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dialogflow is a little finicky and not too easy to use. However, we overcame this challenge through hard work.

                <p>
                    We're proud of learning Dialogflow and creating the website from scratch.

                    What's next for Sexual Assault Chatbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping that sexual assault victims can stand up from their adverse experience through following the advice and resources given from Sexual Assault Chatbot. To that end, we are planning to publicize this resource through Stanford's SARA office so that many people can benefit from our software.
