                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a prototype of a product that in the future can be used to automate even more parts of our daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our SMS Robot can move upon receiving SMS texts from a phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our robot with a Raspberry Pi model B+ and an Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product stopped working last minute and we didn't have time to implement all the features we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working product in less than 12 hours of build time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, we should come prepared and have a clearer idea of what exactly we are doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SMS Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making our product have many more features which can be used to make our daily lives better and easier on us. We also plan on making the product larger, etc, and it could even potentially become a more advanced car.
