                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to keep up with our events on Facebook, and wanted to make a hands-free way to interact with them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gets events that are coming up, and events that are happening in a given location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the Facebook API to get events
Uses bing maps to get geocode from a query
Uses SUTime natural language processing to parse time instructions (e.g. tonight, next week, before May)
All this included in an Amazon Alexa Lambda, written in Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook API keys kept expiring
The Alexa API is very difficult to debug
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a working interface for getting events
Used geocoding to get locations
Used natural language processing to get times
                </p>

                    What's next for Alexa Events

                <p>
                    Notifications
Interact with events (accept invitations etc.)
