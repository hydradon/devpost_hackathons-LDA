                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The reason we had this idea is because nowadays, people tend to eat too much unhealthy food like fast food, so they own a higher possibility of having obesity and heart diseases. Therefore, we want to change the lifestyle starting with our lunch habit. Our application has an abundant of recipes with nutrition advice, which list out all calories and ingredients content(like protein, fat, or minerals&hellip;), and the recipes also have clear instructions. Moreover, rapid pace of modern life makes people barely get a chance to sit down and have a healthy and relaxing lunch. They often just grab a togo-lunch and return to unfinished tasks right away. We hope to slow down people&rsquo;s lifestyle and have more leisure time by using this app. Besides eating more healthily, it also gives people an opportunity to meet new friends. Although many of meet up app such as tinder and skout have been developed, most of them focus on building love relationships. Our app not only pairs up people with different genders, we also match two same-gender users. As a result, it is a good platform for those who want to build up pure friendships. People can exchange lunchbox as well as their life experience. Let&rsquo;s get social by eating lunch!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will search for recipes and then match you with someone nearby
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Angular.js with edamam-api. Then we also added Facebook Api, google map and back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs, such as Facebook and Google Map API sometimes are incompatible with current versions. Another major one is the testing and penetration part. Sometimes it might be frustrating to break something but ultimately learn a lot from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to build a reliable and used lots of relevant technology in very short time. We really enjoyed learning from each other and stayed up all night. Especially, this is the first time for us to participate in a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is the biggest thing we learned from this hackathon. By taking with other hackers, we are able to be engaged in a great environment for learning. We also learned and exchanged ideas between one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lunchbox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe in the future, we will design an advanced system that counts the points of how many time people open or unlock recipes and ratings by others, and these points can transform to discounts of local stores like farmers market to increase the attempt of shopping and eating healthily
