                    As college students, we're always running around, attempting to keep up with our academics and not having enough time to ourselves. All of us in the team are big users of Google Calendar, but realize it is quite a limited app. It gets frustrating when we have to constantly update assignments we didn't have time to finish due to other commitments or personal reasons. Our inspiration for building this site was to automate this process, and be able to constantly redo it if needed with no additional effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second inspiration we had for this project was the mental health emphasis for this hackathon. We've all had personal struggles with mental health, no matter how big or small. And we realize that not everyone is aware that even the small things really do take a toll on a person's mental health and it hurts them even if they are not officially diagnosed with a mental illness. Our website takes into account your mental state that day to try to determine how to best meet your deadlines without over stressing you. If you happen to mark any emotional state that may cause distress, we implement a little bit of your day to do some relaxation or breathing exercises as well. We recognize that everyone needs to be able to stop sometimes.
                </p>

                    We all learned how to use Python Flask incorporated with regular HTML and CSS this hack. Many of our issues stemmed from the fact that we are all new to this implementation, and time was our biggest challenge overall. (In between all the midterms we have this coming week and the lack of sleep, this challenge inspired our website as well).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are grateful for the experience at HackSC, and hope you enjoy our hack, even while incomplete. We hope you look forward to a finished project in the future!
