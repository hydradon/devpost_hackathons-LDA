                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this weekend we have learned how KONE manages People Flow processes in diverse buildings.
And it has been amazing to learn how one push of an elevator button on another floor can override current Flow plan and force KONE to recalculate and optimize its operations.
And this all is, of course, invisible to the end user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, there is so much one can optimize when users needs are known at the very last minute. By this, I mean that user enters through access managed doors or order the elevator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For optimal operations the sooner KONE know where the end user is going, the better elevator operations it can provide. This translates less time waiting for the elevator and fewer stops on your way up or down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    flowPro turns one action to a chain reaction, that enables the end user to move to her destination effortlessly.  But the real value comes from the info, that flowPro provides to KONE and facility managers. The sooner accurate info about people moving needs and building utilization levels can is collected, better and efficient operations can be planned.

                <p>
                    IBM Cloud MQTT service was a bit too much work for the limited time. It was replaced with other MQTT provider
Proximi.io service crashed during the last night. Good for us theyt were committed to get their service back up and running and we managed to complete the challenge with Proximi.io.
