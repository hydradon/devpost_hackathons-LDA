                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been really curious to see what people standing at the bus stop or eating in a food court would say to the people around them, people they could see and hear, if they would remain anonymous. Speakon is a social feed that can only be written to and read by those who are within earshot of one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speakon allows you to communicate anonymously with people within earshot. Speakon brings a new level of intimacy to anonymous chatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speakon is built using Evothings and PhoneGap to wrap the Javascript into a native iOS app, and then utilizes Firebase for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way I built this app (unknowingly) did not allow me to compile it correctly in Xcode while still having access to PhoneGap plugins. But it does work in the Evothings workbench.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also spent a lot of time trying to set up AWS and host my images on S3. Little did I know that I could save them to Firebase since they were already in binary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first project that I have ever shipped at a hackathon. I am very proud of myself for doing so. This is also the first app that I have built myself, meaning I got to make all of the design decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also very proud of how much I learned doing this project. I know understand Angular on a whole new level. Getting those images to load via Firebase also made my entire weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a valuable lesson. I took the easy route in getting started - using Evothings, and now I don't have a native iOS app. That's a bit of a bummer but it happens. I knew Evothings was too good to be true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned a lot about Angular. I use it almost everyday, but to do work inside of a system that I did not originally design. Getting to design this app was a great way to solidify and expand on the Angular that I already knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Speakon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one of my design lab classes I am going to wrap Speakon correctly so that it works as a native app.
                </p>
