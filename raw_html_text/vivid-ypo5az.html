                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From personal experience in tutoring a child with ADHD, I learned how important it is to just help them remember the tasks they need to accomplish and to let them take a break if they need it to calm down to assist their concentration. Many young children I have tutored also get restless when working on homework, or often forget things as well. My team and I wanted to create an easily accessible webpage that is simple to learn and use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a checklist that a parent or guardian has access to edit to remind their child of tasks they need to complete, or items they need to remember to bring certain places, as parents often are not able to be constantly watching their child every hour of the day. The webpage also gives the child the opportunity to take short breaks to use activities and small games to calm down to refocus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Vivid by using GitHub and Mongodb with languages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We created all our own graphics, sprites and backgrounds with digital art on a drawing tablet, and also created our own music meant to soothe the player in the mini games and activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we began this project, we had planned to use Django, but we ran into technical difficulties, so we switched to use MEAN. We were also unable to properly connect to the Amazon Web Services, and are currently keeping our project on our local host until we can solve the technical difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of us were able to come in to this hackathon with little to no knowledge on JavaScript, or HTML, and learn enough to create and code this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but more importantly we learned the difficulties of working on and coding for 24 hours straight. Even so, it was a great learning experience that help us to work on a technical project cooperatively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vivid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add a scheduled calendar feature, and a more user friendly experience for parents to manage their children's schedule.
