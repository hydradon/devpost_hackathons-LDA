                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of students struggle with getting into college. Or then apply to unreasonable places. We were inspired by our own inner struggles along with what our siblings went through in the past. We wanted to know where we could go to college based on your PSAT/SAT scores, our ACT scores, and our unweighted GPA.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app sorts out reasonable colleges based on PSAT/SAT scores,  ACT scores, and unweighted GPA. It will create a list of colleges where your inputs are greater than the average for all three categorizes. It also has a search bar that searches google for any colleges that are not in our database.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to build this app. Split up the work in order to speed up the process of creating the app. We used multiple IDE's to test out certain functions such as Eclipse and JGRASP. This allowed us to find our what was wrong in certain parts of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to us splitting up the work, it was difficult for us to synchronize all of our work onto one platform. We also had a tough time web scrapping information from different websites. We also were unable to read a file from a android studio. We found out that the data must be inside the phone to access by the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete our idea, and that our idea was original to us. We are also proud that we were able to think of an idea that is so versatile among all students as a majority of the students go to college. We are also so glad that we were able to get the URL search properly working the first time. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to make it look professional.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that is very important to listen to what others have to say, and that teamwork is very important in the work place. This lesson can be applied to a real workplace setting, which shows how HackTJ can really teach important lessons in the future. We also learned how to web scrape and use Google searches in our program.

                    What's next for CollegiateCompanion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more data to our databases. Right now we only have a minimal amount of colleges that we have information from. This is due to the lack of information contained in anyone website. If we had more time, we would have been able to get more information on different colleges.  We would be able to get rid of this if we had more data. We would also like to further sort our data based on finance, distance, rank, and scholarship opportunities.
