                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to check our answers in physics class when we are trying to study for a test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    based on the surface, planet, and applied force on an object, we find the net force on that object, and then we use that in conjunction with newtons second law in order to find the acceleration of that object, and then we simulated its acceleration using graphics.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we wrote all of the code using our prior knowlege from AP computer science A and other knowlegle that goes beyond that with graphics based on a graphics course inour school.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There wes a silly mistake that we made that we spent about an hour looking at which was that we accidentally forgot to initilize and object, so then we had to use a bunch of print statements to realize which object was null.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we made a moving object, which i previously wasnt able to do, and partially my partner taght me how to do it, and partially I taught some of it to myself, so now I can make my older projects cooler by using graphics.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    How to do graphics

                <h2>
                    What's next for Net force and the acceleration that it causes on an object
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add then a segment for projectoile motion with having an initial velocity instead of starting at rest, and then we can, extend this to have the force that is acting upon it act as an angle rather than only horizonal as well.
