                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After an event or a party we spend a significant amount of time creating whatsapp groups or facebook albums to share photos or videos amongst our family &amp; friends. There is NO one solution that allows real-time collaboration of pictures and videos - right when they are taken, right there in the moment. 
This led us to the idea of "PhotoHub" - a real time collaborative media sharing mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "PhotoHub" is a mobile application that allows a user to create "event" based buckets to which they can upload photos and videos automatically. These uploads can be done using two modes:
a) Auto Share - The camera goes into a burst upload mode i.e. whatever picture the user clicks, it is automatically uploaded to the event bucket, of course with the user's consent!
b) Instant Share - The camera goes into a "Approve Before Load" mode i.e. whatever picture the user clicks, he/she is asked to approve, before it's uploaded to the event bucket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Family and friends can subscribe to these buckets (by Invite only) to receive photos and videos in real time as they are being created. In addition, they can also contribute to the same event bucket.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mobile application using Android Studio. Amazon S3 is used as a backend storage to store the media in real time.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dynamically creating event buckets for users and storing them in Amazon S3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amazon S3 went down 3 hours before the final submission. We had to almost pivot from our backend infrastructure.

                <p>
                    We want to be the facilitators of a truly connected, collective sharing ecosystem of multimedia for people across the globe. We intend to publish this application to the Android Play Store, after ironing out the kinks and making it production ready.
