                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At work we'd like to get out a little more, intellectually speaking. To make that happen, we want to show our company the value of cognitive computing. Once our bosses get the potential, we'll have a chance to lead the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal was to explore our data and dig up insights. Once we're back home, we'll turn those insights into tools and recommendations for our sales team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step by step:
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we used the Alchemy API to enrich thousands of sales chat logs with linguistic metrics (sentiment, key words, etc).
Second, we looked for correlation between linguistic metrics and successful chat outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We verified these hypotheses:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Chats with positive sentiment generate more follow-up calls from customers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Agents who talk like the customer generate more follow-up calls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keywords from sales agent speech are good for predicting call outcomes
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Present these observations at the next companywide Red Ventures meeting. Convince our bosses they want us to work on this full time.
