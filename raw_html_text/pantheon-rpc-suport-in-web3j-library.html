                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RPC communication is not standardized among Ethereum clients. Because of that there needs to be a specific implementation of RPC communication in libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an interface in web3j library to access Pantheon specific RPC calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've forked the web3j github repository and implemented the interface.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of the project was to get to know the structure of web3j library.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems to work :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how important it is to standardize interfaces among clients and how to use Pantheon client and it's interesting Pantheon-specific features.
