                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of on campus events, most of which offer food to attract more people. However, there is usually a waste of food because there is an overestimation of attendees. We want to reduce the waste by offering students who are willing to pick up the food that would have been wasted from these events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a platform with detailed location, time frame, type of food and available servings for event hosts and students that make hosts create a donation page easily, and also allows the students to see which on-campus event is giving away food in a clear and neat interface. This also allows the hosts to keep track of the people coming to pick up the food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build an iOS app with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all first-time coders for Swift. We ran into challenges while trying to learn and make the app concurrently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the flow of the app, with the many features. And being beginners in it, we are especially proud to create the public feed of events for students with live updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt Swift, utilizing iOS tools, and the entire process of building an iOS application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for foodShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more flair to the app with more aesthetics. We will also upgrade the features to include a chatroom between the hosts and students. We would also like to use e-mail verification and map APIs. Furthermore, we would like to utilize this app for the common public as well and allow a person to pick up multiple meals.
