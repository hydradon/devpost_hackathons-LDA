                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In lieu of Twitter controlled coffee makers, that possibility of controlling and communicating with devices through SMS created by LTE-M is exhilarating. To challenge ourselves and experiment with new technology, we decided to work on a project incorporating these aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In its completed guise, the system consists of a Telus IoT starter kit that receives sensor input and sends it Microsoft Azure via LTE-M. From MS Azure, sensor information is translated into a boolean that sends a SMS message via Twilio to the user. The user can then respond to the text to execute a mechanical action back at the Telus IoT starter kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, due to time constraints and technical challenges, the Telus IoT starter kit achieved connectivity to basic MS Azure and the Twilio runs through a local server, to connect to the cellular device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create two-way LTE-M communication with the IoT, we broke our project down into two main tasks: gathering data into Azure, and creating a connection between Azure and the cellular device.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure is a particularly challenging and intimidating platform for new programmers. Unfamiliarity with C# also proved a great challenge and hindrance to using MS Azure. Setting up the Telus IoT kit was also filled with many hidden pitfalls. Twilio proved too much of a challenge to feasibly tackle in the time of this event.

                <p>
                    Setting up Telus IoT starter kit with MS Azure and exploring the functions and potential of Twilio.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the great potential for long distance remote control through LTE-M and SMS messaging wich could revolutionize future connectivity, allowing greater control of devices, from farther away distances.

                    What's next for TExtLUS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Down the pipes, TExtLUS will need to see connectivity between MS Azure and Twilio fulfilled for full functionality.
