                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask many runners about their enjoyment of their current routine and they will probably tell you that they are "pun-derwhelmed." What if we could shake up our mutotinous routes and make them more enjoyable? Punning is our solution to the dilemma of working out or having fun, because now you can do both!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Punning expands the realm of possibility on every run or walk you embark on. Unsure where to start? Punning charts you a semi-random, curated journey of discovering the puns all around you. Upon starting your run, Punning directs you from one classic Ann Arbor landmark to another, discovering location-specific puns at each landmark. Pick your distance and pick your pun-tolerance, and Punning provides you a route with the mileage you want and puns you deserve. Maybe you're more of a comedian than a runner? Write up a pun and send it to a landmark to give runners a chuckle,
                    <strong>
                        or
                    </strong>
                    amaze passerbys with your ingenuity. That's right! You can use Punning whenever and wherever you want, finding puns that others have created or dropping one yourself. With the extra boost of motivation to start and complete your runs, Punning has something for everyone and everything for you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our puns and locations live in Firebase, and arrived via Insomnia. We built an iOS app with Swift to interact with Firebase through a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever written an iOS app before and building this app taught us the ins and outs of sharing our puns with the world.
                </p>

                    We learned how to build iOS apps and some things about Flask and Firebase.
