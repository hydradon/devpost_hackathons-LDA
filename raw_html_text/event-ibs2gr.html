                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always frustrating when people sign up for facebook events but then don't actually attend. As an event organizer, these people are the worst! We created this app for people who want to encourage themselves to keep their commitments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can sign into your Facebook, and the app pulls the events you're said to be attending. If you are not in the event location at the time of the event, then the app will donates 5$ out of your bank account into to the charity of your choice. This will hopefully help people who struggle with keeping their commitments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the app for the android platform. We attempted to integrate the Capitol One API to allow us to easily transfer money to banks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the Capitol One API was offline or unreliable for the weekend of the competition. We attempted to set up our app to work with their API, but progress was very slow because we were unable to connect to their servers for the majority of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the Capital one API code implemented, so when their servers are back online it will be able to move money from the user's sample account into another sample charity account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes you can be hit with unexpected problems that are outside of your control, and that all you can do is try to work around them as best as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Event$
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to take some time to improve the app visually so that it looks appealing. Additionally, we would like to switch off Capitol One's Hackathon API and move onto their real platform so that users can transfer money from their real account.
