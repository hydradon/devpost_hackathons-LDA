                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next Jump's motto of
                    <strong>
                        "Do the little things that let others achieve the great things they were meant to do"
                    </strong>
                    encouraged us to brainstorm the issues faced by people during the most difficult periods of their lives - for example, the stress faced by a single parent raising a child. 
We realised that one way we could do this was to ensure the safety of the child if accidentally left unsupervised around the house as the most serious incidents occur in the kitchen and
                    <em>
                        64% of all these incidents occur to toddlers aged between 0-4 years old
                    </em>
                    which is an enormous 43,000 a year in England alone.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A photo of the toddler and the responsible adult is uploaded to our system and a camera is fixed at the kitchen. If the camera detects the face of the toddler without the face of the responsible adult, their computer starts beeping in order to alert the responsible adult.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along with a camera, we found components of the python code that we needed from the face recognition library from GitHub. This was used to program the camera to detect the faces of the toddler and the responsible adult. We then adapted the code so that it fit our specific purpose which was to alert the parent if only the toddler's face was detected on the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, but the hardest part of developing our system was getting the facial recognition aspect to work. In order to test our system, we used pictures of toddlers obtained from Google Images, and due to the low quality of our camera, they were often not detected.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest achievement was getting our facial recognition system to work. We were absolutely blown away at the fact that we built a visual sensor during the limited 24 hour time period.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both mine and Matej's first hackathon, and we both didn't know each other before this. We learnt a lot about collaboration and our working styles. As an bonus, we also learnt how to build a facial recognition system which is incredibly cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for safe environment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to build an interface like a mobile app that allows you to manage the images and sends you the alerts. The camera could also be fixed into smart fridges for more integration. Lastly, we would like to also develop a similar system for rooms with stairs as they are also a threat.
