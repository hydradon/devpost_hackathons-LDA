                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing how people with lots of followers struggle to keep the bots who flood their mentions with spam, I thought there had to be an easier way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you block a list of known twitter bots with a single click, saving you the hassle of blocking one by one and avoiding having to interact with them again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a simple Flask app with an SQL database to save the bot list, as the interface is so simple it does not need any more difficult technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of trouble getting OAuth to work, but once that worked everything kept rolling in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the idea this will help save people from social network stress and make Twitter a more enjoyable experience for everyone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with OAuth and the Twitter API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bot Killer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the bot list collaborative under the supervision of a set of trusted moderators which will ensure no real accounts end up in the list, even those like @realDoanldTrump.
