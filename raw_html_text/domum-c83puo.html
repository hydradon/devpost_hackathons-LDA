                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the current generation leaning towards sharing economy, people like to share apartment space with other people, especially with strangers. This sharing economy raised much concern in building management and utility fee sharing between each resident in one apartment having one account for electricity, Wi-Fi and gas. Residents need to have basic trust with each other that people pay their part of the fees and they are not using too much electricity to disbenefit another people paying equally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system gives a demonstration on a future blockchain application on smart building management geared towards sharing economy apartments for residents. Domum used the raspberry pi to set up a smart IoT outlet device put at the apartment&rsquo;s power supply box. It accurately checks for the amount left in the users' wallet and measures the usage of electricity for each room. We then used the IOTA blockchain for trustless and feeless micropayments for each residents' consumption and make sure the consumption data is valid and unaltered. On the user end, the experience is the same as using an app.

                <p>
                    The whole system is currently semi-decentralized. With a MongoDB server running to manage user experience and offloading some computational and storage need for the IOTA blockchain. IOTA handles the micropayment and each transaction could be completed and confirmed in mins as well as making sure the data integrity. For the data integrity, the semi-decentralized system will not have any compromise in data in integrity and decentralization for verification because the hash value of each transaction in the MongoDB server is stored to IOTA network.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Android user app is powered by the MongoDB to enable a smooth experience. The Domum IoT device is developed with Raspberry Pi to demonstrate consumption for 2 rooms.

                    Learning the IOTA blockchain and its development for the first time

                <p>
                    Blockchain can be fun!!! We really need to think about the real use case for the technology and focus on its advantages as a semi-decentralized or fully decentralized system.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We right now want to expand to other utilities than electricity, and then eventually build the future of smart building sharing economy.
