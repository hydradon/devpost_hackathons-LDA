                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was an interest to take up new challenge working with datasets and to help predict people of potential genetic disorder
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have not managed to fully develop the application. We had a bottleneck at analysing the data from the datasets given on AWS. We couldn't manage to analyse the data in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially approached it in building it with python but that didn't work, then I tried to approach it with php and it was still not very efficient. We finally managed to build it using lambda JSON on AWS, but it gave us an access denied issue
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I solved an issue with PHP that I later fixed.

                    What's next for AstroGene
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Astrogene has a lot of potential to help the people with their gene analysis program and find cure for some serious diseases and illnesses
