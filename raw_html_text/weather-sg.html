                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore's Weather Is Very Unpredictable, As such we decided that it would be interesting to develop web app on the chrome store that allows us and anyone to know the weather in detail before heading out
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works like all chrome app, select it from the top right and a drop-down will come out where you can see the latest temperature readings every 3 hours and for the next 3 days
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with Codepen to build the HTML and CSS but moved on to Atom to include the API's and Javascript, using Open Weather API, Google Fonts &amp; Codepen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add in PSI information from the Governement Dataset, However, the API and links were not working and We wanted to add a share button for them to see the app but we could not do so as it was a chrome web app and not a website/webpage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app and complied the datasets ourselves, had a load of fun and stress building the web-app in a limited time constraint, which was done from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, Understanding API's and building a web app in general
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather@SG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the PSI information, share button(share to your friends!) &amp; Uploading it to the Google Chrome Store
                </p>
