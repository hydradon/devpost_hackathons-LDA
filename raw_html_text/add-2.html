                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app people would enjoy
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in xcode using swift
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members have previous experience coding in Swift, therefore we had a LOT to learn during VandyHacks
                </p>
