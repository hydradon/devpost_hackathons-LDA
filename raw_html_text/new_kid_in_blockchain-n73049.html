                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friend moved out a couple months ago and started living on my own. He suddenly had to take care of things he didn't know about. His parents used to take care of things like rent, electricity, gas, TV, Internet, but now he had to manage it myself. To manage all these things we thought about using an app for that, however, we just couldn't find a proper app that suited his needs and was really committed to do one thing right: keeping track of subscriptions. Most of those apps required an account, had too many features or where quite expensive.
