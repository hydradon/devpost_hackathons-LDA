                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought that the FiscalNote data/API seemed interesting to work with,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two project files are getcode2.html and codespec.html. getcode2 links to codespec.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You type in a first, or last name, but not both, of a legislator. This is put into a query to the Fiscalnote API, and various relevant data is returned. Allows for fast and immediate identification of facts that are of interest to the layperson. Also
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a html based hack, with embedded javascript scripts doing the heavy lifting.
The 'frontend' getcode2 allows the input of a value into a textbox, which is then stored into a variable which persists across a change in webpage. The stored variable is then used as a query to the FiscalNote API. The API returns a big ol JSON object, which is a pain to manually look through. The program then extracts relevant variables, and displays them in a text box. A nice picture of the politician you are looking up pops up as well.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In chrome the error message "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access." Development continued in safari.
                </p>
                <p>
                    urlencoding of + symbols into %2B stopped the development of multi word searches. 
extraction of the photo url to display as an image
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it takes a while to connect to the Api. Such is life.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    The fact that the project works
-connecting to the API and extracting usable data after mishaps with JSONP encoding.
-the fact that a photo actually displays
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        extracting the photo url from the data was hard, because the variable i would save it as would not be compatible with the src="" part of the image tag. I ended up reading it into a hidden directory, and then reading it back out, catenating it with the &lt;img src= part of the script, and placing it into another directory.

                <p>
                    How 2 code better.
My last experience coding was with java in middle school, but I got a handle on dealing with JSON objects and Jquery now.

                    What's next for FiscalNote Reader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expansion into reading other FiscalNote databases: commitees, bills, etc
Improvement on interface, Greater information display. Increased search tolerance. Statistical analysis and interaction with the "friends" and "effectiveness" data.
