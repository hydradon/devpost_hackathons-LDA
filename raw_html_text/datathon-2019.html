                <p>
                    This project is based on 3 sets of data provided by Valassis which
contain various user and customer actions (details in
                    <strong>
                        Data
                    </strong>
                    section).
With a goal of identifying shoppers who are more likely to respond to
digital advertising and thus help companies to wisely spend limited
marketing dollars, we developed two methods described below to analyze
these data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two methods/programs can be used for different data sets and
different purposes to obtain useful information about target groups. For
example, with course selection data for undergraduate or master students
and whether they decided to pursue PhD, our programs will be able to
train am algorithm to predict PhD pursuing rate based on student
courses, and also show which courses may have the most effect on the
student's decision. This can also be used for non-profit organizations
such as science museums to predict interest of a new exhibit for certain
groups of patrons etc.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In digital advertising, a &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; refers to the event when the 
shopper clicks on the ad and performs a valuable action such as signup, 
registration, or makes a purchase.  Since &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is a measurable 
event, it represents a reasonable proxy for the number of customers 
acquired during the ad campaign.  Increasingly, brands and agencies 
looking to put a value on the Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) require
marketers such as us to optimize the ad spend such that customer 
acquisition is maximized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to wisely spend the limited marketing dollars, we need to 
identify the shoppers who are more likely to respond to our ad and 
convert.  While the number of devices to target is nearly one billion, 
the number of conversion events range from just a few hundreds to few 
thousands during the period of the ad campaign.  In other words, these 
conversion events are extremely rare.

                    K-Fold CV is where a given data set is split
into a K number of sections/folds where each fold is used as a testing
set at some point. Lets take the scenario of 5-Fold cross
validation(K=5). Here, the data set is split into 5 folds. In the first
iteration, the first fold is used to test the model and the rest are
used to train the model. In the second iteration, 2nd fold is used as
the testing set while the rest serve as the training set. This process
is repeated until each fold of the 5 folds have been used as the testing
set.
