                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing Pacman with a first-person view would be quite challenging. Not knowing how many enemies, where they could come from, and where the locations of the food items to collect would increase the difficulty level by a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was created using Unity. First the stage or map is designed. Food items are then generated on the board along with the enemies (Pacman ghosts and a Slenderman!) which will kill you upon contact. Powerup items periodically spawn on the map which allows Pacman to eat its enemies if met while Pacman is powered up! Enemies will run away from Pacman when she is in this mode! Take advantage of it! Upon collection of all the food items on the map, you are victorious!

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Automatically generating food items so that it is not generated within non-traversable space (Walls)
Detection collision between game objects
How to correctly texture game objects

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game works! Enemies kill Pacman upon contact, die if this happens when Pacman is powered up. Pacman wins if all the food items are successfully collected. A simple start and game over screen was also implemented to guide players on how to navigate in the game.

                <p>
                    Possibly a compass/radar function which helps guide players to where the remaining food items are
Powerup items which let you detect nearby ghosts or sounds alarms
