                        Inspiration
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    With the advent of doorbells that provide users the ability to monitor their  front doors at all times, we wanted to create an application that would give users the same control when using  virtual reality devices such as Oculus Rift. Since virtual reality limits a person to see or hear things in their surroundings, we made an application that would help user's to pay attention to the outside world.

                    It provides alerts into your game that notify you if someone is at your door based on facial recognition software tied to a camera. The facial recognition software that we developed updates every 3 seconds in order to provide an accurate and live update.

                    <br>
                    Setting up  the Oculus Rift for the first time and learning how to integrate different pieces of software together such as Unity, Clarifai, C#, and Python provided some challenges.  Additionally, troubleshooting software was difficult with our limited experience in using these technologies .

                    Simply being able to achieve the effect we were looking for amid unfamiliar programs and set-ups was quite the accomplishment.

                    <br>
                    We gained familiarity with C#, Python, Oculus, Machine Learning Libraries, and its support software.

                    We plan on further refining the program to add additional functionality such as giving the user the ability to communicate with someone standing outside of their house.
