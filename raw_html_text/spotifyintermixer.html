                        ## Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    My teammates and I use Spotify a lot. We're frequently disappointed that Spotify does not allow users to "Shuffle" songs across more than 1 playlist.

                    <strong>
                        ## What it does
                    </strong>
                    We decided to make Spotify Intermixer, a tool that would allow anyone to combine their playlists into a temporary playlist that lets them to shuffle across the playlists.

                    <strong>
                        ## How I built it
                    </strong>
                    We first started by reading up and researching on the Spotify API, where we could use Spotify's code to make changes to Spotify users' profiles. We use node.js to run the server that would host the web app and make requests to the Spotify API for the user. We used HTML5/CSS for the front end to display the Spotify playlists of the user.

                    <strong>
                        ## Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                    My team ran into the problem of not having any backend scripting language knowledge. This was our first time using Javascript, so we learned a lot after trial and error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran into the problem of merging our code files on Github because this was also the first time using Git as a version control system. I learned how to resolve merge conflicts and made the workflow more streamlined.

                        ## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </strong>
                    We were successfully able to make requests to the Spotify Web API and retrieve user data (with their permission), such as their basic information and playlists. We learned how the Spotify Web API authorized our application and returned .json files with the request information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## What I learned
                    </strong>
                    My team and I learned how to run a server using node.js, how to use certain functions of the Spotify Web API, and how to display information requested from the Spotify Web API to a web page.

                        ## What's next for SpotifyIntermixer
                    </strong>
                    Full functionality of the tool, where users will be able to combine the their playlists for "Shuffle" mode to play across more than one playlist.
