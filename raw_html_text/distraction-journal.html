                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the cognitive dissonance between lacking productivity and the stress that people face due to work is a paradigm that is frequently encountered among many. Solving this issue would benefit several aspects of society. It would result in more work getting done, more control over the user's life, decreased stress from the satisfaction of increased productivity, and allow people to unlock their full creative potential, reaching a state of self-actualization.
We strongly believe that this small website will cause a big impact on society, and it will be a key to accelerate amelioration in the world.

                <p>
                    The Distraction Journal essentially brings awareness to the user about what exactly is the source of any low productivity. The user logs their distractions in everyday life that lowers their productivity, with a counter for each, individual distraction to keep count of how many times the corresponding distraction has veered their focus away from work. This allows the user to visually see what things are causing them to get distracting, and gives them more control over how they will manage their time and combat these distractions. Accounts are free as well!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The composition of this code includes Vue, JavaScript, and CSS, working in conjunction with a Firebase database that will store all data pertaining to the user's logged distractions.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many little bugs and errors that needed to be fixed. It consumed much of our time, which seemed to be the real challenge we had to face.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of being able to set goals and completing them within the given time frame, given that we also had to learn new languages to accomplish this. With this in mind, we are also very proud of having reached the level we did in the languages that we did not know, walking into DeltaHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned coding languages, linking front end and back end smoothly, how to use git very efficiently in a team, and further developing our skills in coding in a team rather than by ourselves.

                    What's next for Distraction Journal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regarding the direction we want the Distraction Journal to go, we want it to act on these distractions the user has logged in order to aid them in managing there time. We want to potentially be able to potentially not allow the user to have access to certain distractions online; however, it is important to remember to not be too intrusive and do too much, for the goal of the Distraction Journal is for the user to control their life and manage their time better for their own good and for the good of society.
