                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No-one likes arriving in town only to find you can't move for the crowds around you. Our online tool allows you to easily check how busy your destination is likely to be, in the same way to checking the weather forecast, without having to leave the house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool queries historical data of footfall on selected days, months and times, in specified locations, to calculate average footfalls in certain conditions, and show the user what the footfall is likely to be. This footfall is modelled as crowding agents, displayed upon a map of the specified location, with the agents avoiding obstacles such as buildings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Coffeescript for modelling the boids, with the database in SQL, and JS and PHP scripts linking it together with google maps.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The google maps style API has some problems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our scripts and database stopped working together when we tried to host in all on a server
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JS wasn't made for image processing
