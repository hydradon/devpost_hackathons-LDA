                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rental process is very expensive and combersum for both the renter and the potential rentee. Background checks, and rental history inquiries can quickly become expensive while also making the process very slow. The blockchain is a perfect solution to solve this problem.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Renter's rental history (payments, late payments, evictions, etc) is encoded and saved on the NEO blockchain. As well as rental properties information (damages, condemnation, etc). Renters can also pay their rent/damages with NEO
