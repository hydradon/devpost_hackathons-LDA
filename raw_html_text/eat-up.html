                <p>
                    Ordering food is essential for working people. When it's raining outside, one might wanna order from a delivery service. What's more convinient to have Alexa helping you with the order?

                    <li>
                        A Lambda is invoked and gets a list of recently used restaurants is called from a RESTful API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The order is submitted to another Lambda function, which calls a phone number and says the order. The text-to-speech conversion is done with Polly.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to reduce the complexity. It would have been nice to place an order for a whole group of people. Accomplishing complex workflows requires to understand the way Alexa works. Doing things in a conversational way is very different than the common way to write software.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are all new to Alexa development, so first thing we are proud of is that we could wire everything together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, we were able to use Polly for synthesizing speech from text and actually do a phone call.
