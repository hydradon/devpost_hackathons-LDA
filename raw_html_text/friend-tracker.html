                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all the times people have set up a time to meet with friends, and been left waiting and wondering "Where are they?!?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friend tracker is a mobile app that is turned on when two or more friends are heading to a meeting place. Seeing your
friend via GPS on their way takes away the impatient thoughts of "where are they?", "did they forget?", or "did they get in a horrific car accident and need my SuperHuman assistance?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team worked using Android, Parse, and the Google Maps AP I to communicate real-time gps tracking between phones to show your friend's current location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having much experience with the Google API proved tricky at times but helped make for a great product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am so proud that we made an app that at I at least believe will have a small, but in my opinion, a meaningful impact on the lives of my peers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that one must be prepared to hack as soon as possible to make the best product possible, and that it is really rewarding to take on unknown material within Computer Science!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Friend Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, my hope is to polish the app until it is the best it can be and put it out and see if other people find it as useful as I believe it will be for me!!
