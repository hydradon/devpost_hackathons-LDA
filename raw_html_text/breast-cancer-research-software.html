                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    5,000 Canadian women die from breast cancer every year. It is necessary that we step up and find the source of this tragic condition. This is what drives our group forward. We need change, and we will be the change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application surveys a set audience that currently has breast cancer. Our goal is to discover new possible causes of cancer by using Microsoft Azure. The survey data consists of the lifestyles of cancer sufferers and is uploaded into a database, where it is compared to other cancer sufferers' data. Microsoft Azure will process the massive amounts of survey data and will find similarities between the lifestyles of people currently suffering from breast cancer. This way, we can further research these similarities and come up with a breakthrough for a potential cause of cancer, including not having access to clean drinking water or the diets of individuals. For example, if not having access to clean drinking water is something common in breast cancer sufferers, we can raise even more awareness about the health hazards mining or fracking creates to both individuals and the environment. This will pressure the international community into ending these hazardous practices. The survey is then conducted on people who currently do not have breast cancer. Their data is compared to the data in Azure of cancer sufferers to predict if their lifestyle could potentially lead to breast cancer. We will remain in touch in participants to ensure that they are safe and to improve the accuracy of our data to save more lives.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is built using a quiz made in Python and a cloud database using Microsoft Azure. We have tested a similar program with Azure to ensure that our plan is feasible. When the database for the lifestyles of cancer sufferers is created, it will be run through Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest learning curve was figuring out to use Azure. It is a software that is completely new to us, and we spent a good amount of time researching the program and watching tutorials to make a test program work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being the pioneers of the hybrid realm of cloud computing and breast cancer research.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, we did experiment and learn how to use a new software. However, we learned that teamwork is key to getting the job done. Without aiding each other in the formulation of this program, we would not have be successful in presenting it today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Breast Cancer Research Software
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This same process can actually be used to find a cure for cancer! The survey data of the lifestyles of cancer sufferers who have gone into remission can also be uploaded into Azure. This will enable us to see patterns in what may have caused the remission. We will then be able to pinpoint a specific field to focus our research on and encourage current cancer sufferers to follow that specific lifestyle. In addition to this, our software can be used to find potential causes and cures for other forms of cancer.
