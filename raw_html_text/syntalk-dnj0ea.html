                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be it your social life or professional life, one tends to face certain language barriers somewhere somehow!
We wanted to solve the problem of language barrier that hinders the growth. Better communication means a more efficient and better world. Students across the world can't experience the same quality of education everywhere. Moreover, Businesses would run more efficiently around the world if we have a better communication with the customers, but this comes with a huge cost of hiring candidates who can speak multiple languages. But, we'll give these organisations/people the necessary tools to overcome these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought to revolutionise the way we use video calling to overcome such problems faced by students, businesses and practically each person who speaks a different language. With this two people/organisations, who don't even have the same common language of conversation can talk to each other, this platform converts the real time audio in video call into a language that person knows or wants to talk in. It basically solves a big problem and makes life easier.
Video calling brought down to use with the feature of language translation and speech.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated a couple of latest technologies to bring this product into light, with integration of Google Translation API, Google Cloud Speech API and Responsive Voice API with stream of data being carried over on a socket connection. The idea of 2 socket connections, one for video and another for streaming and processing audio was to reduce latency and produce a better possible video chat experience.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project in the given time while learning new technology stack was a big challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have been able to solve a huge problem and create a working prototype with the core features in the allocated 36 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implement Google Cloud Speech API, WebRTC, Google Translation API, Socket.io, Responsive Voice API

                    What's next for Syntalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make this prototype more efficient, introduce new features such as audio calling and sync more people at the same time around the world, reducing any latency issues in the socket connection.
