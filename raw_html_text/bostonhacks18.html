                    Currently police get texts about warnings, but they have one screen that the texts come up on at the police station, and the texts basically show up in the same order they come in. There is no other information other than what's in the text body itself, and the only way to get any location data is to pray that the person reporting the crime included it, and to open and read the text. This can cause delays in police response time as they have to manually go through the data. We developed this idea after talking to police providing security at BostonHacks 2018, and we thought that we could provide a useful product!

                    On the civilian side, the people might not necessarily save the police number.
They also might not have the time to get their exact location. Our mobile application
automatically sends a text message and geotags the location.

                <p>
                    Once the web application receives the text, the location data is extracted, and plotted on a map for easy visualization to law enforcement. The text body is then extracted along with the date and time received, to allow law enforcement easy methods to to see the data and visualize. We create a roadmap for future projects, where machine learning could be used to determine the severity of a warning based on sentiment analysis of the message body.

                    The message is sent to twilio, which then sends the message to the web application.
The web application determines an address from the geo coordinates of the text.
The application then puts the data on a dashboard with the text, and will
determine priority for the police (example, if multiple tips come in for location A
but only two come in for location B, then location A would be prioritized over location B) (this was the idea, but we couldn't get it to 100% work...)

                    Background of this app, currently police get texts about warnings, but they
have one screen that the texts come up on.
They are assigned in order of them coming in, and the only way to get location
is to open the text and read it. This causes the police to sort through
the data mentally/manually, and is time consuming.
