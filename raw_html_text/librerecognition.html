                    Tired of having to rely on
                    <strong>
                        proprietary
                    </strong>
                    API for your image classification (ML) tasks?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can upload images to our web app and then the model AUTOMATICALLY build, training a choice of classifiers, which then becomes available to everyone to use. You don't have to choose parameters, you just upload your images, we take care of the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a back-end in python which does the actual ML. It runs on the server so the users doesn't have his CPU overrun by the ASTONISHING number of calculations which our app does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting our web app on the real web (and not on localhost). We also had trouble prepping the pictures for the ML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does work and we can tell between apples and bananas (most of the time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to extend our web app to accept other kinds of data and to support neural nets classifiers.
