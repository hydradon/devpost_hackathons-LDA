                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted free food, and also swag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users upload their resume. They are then sent rejection (or acceptance) emails from the server, with a link to a page summarizing which skills accepted applicants tended to list on their resume. [Not actually fully implemented]
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is written in NodeJS and python. The server is hosted on Heroku for now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were in the basement, they kept forgetting to inform us about important events like dinner, we also seldom got mentor advice and had to wait a long time to get our sweatshirts. Also: trying to put our project onto Azure proved to be more trouble than it was worth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We won trivia two weeks ago. Also, Ivan can juggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got some good practice with NodeJS, and got to maintain our Python skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Closure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking of maintaining the code line to make it fully functional, and include some basic security, as well as delineations for specific companies.
