                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are now accustomed to see phone videos of protests, fights, and police brutality, but these videos are only able to show us what the person using the camera decides to record. When you are limited to record solely out of your front or back camera without restarting important details may be left out. Face2Face is about telling both sides of the story by automatically switching the camera to record what is most important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using voice recognition, the camera will switch back and forth between the front and back camera depending on who is talking. The video will later be saved and recorded onto your camera library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using swift and many of its libraries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was the hardware limitation of the iPhone. We wanted to record from both the front and the back camera at the same time but this is not possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the AVFoundation swift library to access the phone's inputs and output on the lowest level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That your really good idea might not be possible and you have to ready to adapt.

                    What's next for Face2Face
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve voice recognition and additional activating triggers. Refine overall camera features.
