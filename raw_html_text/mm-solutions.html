                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the plethora of incredible APIs available for us to use, however we found that Microsoft's Project Oxford and Azure were the ones that most suited our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides companies with more data on their customers and their consumer demographic by using facial recondition on people that enter their store. Consumers also benefit by having the option to receive texts on sales that are not advertised or exclusive promotions.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first get access to the computer's webcam to take pictures. Using a  windows application form, customers are able to register and submit their picture that we save on a Microsoft Azure database. Every second, the program takes a picture and we run the pictures into the Microsoft Facial Recognition. We used the Twilio API to to send text messages to the registered members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project was challenging since we never used any of the libraries and APIs, so we had to learn how to use the API and the libraries.
