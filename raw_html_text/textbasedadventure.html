                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was a phone game called lifeline

                    Text based adventure

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using java, combining object orientated programming

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we accidentally named classes into the same names, and not using github. Small mistakes too like missing bracket. The code isn't neat either
                </p>

                    being able to have a finished product that is interesting

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    teamwork split up in between object orientation is interesting when it comes together
                </p>

                <p>
                    a bunch of tears. this is really the first work we made ourselves and not projects given from schools. it was enjoyable
