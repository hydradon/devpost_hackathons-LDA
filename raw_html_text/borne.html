                </p>
                <p>
                    Mosquitos impact the lives of people around the world in different ways, from nuisance and bother at our Callaghan campus, to serious health burdens from the Congo to Cambodia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst they vary in impact, both problems involve people wanting solutions. By uniting these two communities through shared experience, we can create a system in which the needs of everyone are met in a financially sustainable manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mosquito-borne diseases represent a substantial burden of disease throughout the world, and a number of  highly effective public health interventions already exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WHO's Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (2016&ndash;2030) set forth challenges in the fight against malaria, stating that,

                        &ldquo;the greatest of these is the lack of robust, predictable and sustained international and domestic financing&rdquo;.

                    Our innovative funding model.
                    <br>
                    We believe a social enterprise can generate funds via the sale of a product in areas of mosquito nuisance, which can then be spent on interventions in areas significantly burdened by mosquito-borne diseases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking to connect these two communities through their shared experience of the bother and burden of mosquitos &ndash; alleviating the nuisance and funding the fight against disease.

                    In Australia, we&rsquo;re an apparel company. We sell design-conscious clothing that&rsquo;s insecticide treated. We only source products that rank as the most environmentally responsible. The insecticide is odourless, colourless and repels mosquitos for up to 70 washes. This treatment is already commercially available by a third-party company who we&rsquo;ll engage. Unlike the majority of insecticide-treated clothing, typically designed for hiking, our brand focuses on casual wear, conducive to the average day of a uni-student or Novocastrian. Our target audience wants to have a mosquito-free day without compromising their fashion choices, and they&rsquo;re looking to give those in disease-affected areas a mosquito-free sleep.

                <p>
                    In disease-affected areas, we fund effective and research-focussed health interventions to decrease the health risks of mosquitos. The WHO (2016-2030), lists long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying as the pillars for vector control in endemic areas. We&rsquo;ll engage with partner NGOs who already have the skill and relationships to deploy these effective solutions. We&rsquo;ll provide the funds to our partners, and they&rsquo;ll implement their research-backed strategies.

                    Our main innovation is our social enterprise funding model; our research of existing social enterprises supports this innovation. Similar movements have been extremely successful, such as Thankyou (Australia; operating since 2008) and TOMS (US; 2017 annual revenue of $400million).
                    <br>
                    An online marketplace will expedite the creation, marketing, and sale of our products. We have located and priced partners who will handle the manufacture and insecticide treatment of the shirts, and we&rsquo;ve created initial designs for a limited product range.

                    In order to utilise the proceeds from our &ldquo;front end&rdquo; most effectively, we&rsquo;ll partner with existing NGOs, leveraging their prior research and experience in logistics and resource management. We&rsquo;ve researched and selected a number of suitable NGOs and will reach out to them in the following months.
