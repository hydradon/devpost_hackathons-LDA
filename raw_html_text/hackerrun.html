                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have worked a lot with Unity in the past, but never had the opportunity to build anything in 2D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a 2D platformer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used pre-animated and designed assets to create levels for our game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are going to build a website for it to be hosted on using Domain.com
