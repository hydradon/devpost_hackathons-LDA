                    The hive is everywhere. 
Everyone has opinions. And anyone could look for advice to everyday questions. In fact, we make an average of 35,000 decisions a day. We&rsquo;re connecting users all around the world so that any user can solicit opinions from anyone anywhere any time, in real-time. Just hive it on hiveit.org.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you could tap into a readily-available online community &amp; collect suggestions on these everyday decisions in real-time?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what if we could collect this data for a ML algorithm (fed onto a Messenger Chatbot or a voice assistant, like FB Aloha) that is enabled to make these simple everyday questions for you in a considered, human-centered way?

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focussed on one use case: deciding what outfit to wear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built two modules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Sourcing preference data through a fun user-friendly product that was designed using various UX tools and then put together on Wix and using JS.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Developed a ML algorithm that takes this user preference data &amp; predicts preferences for future uploads.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The ML Algorithm was built as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Using Google cloud automated machine learning vision tool to classify clothes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A recommendation to a product will be assigned based on the popularity in the market, people will answer the question by selecting the recommended item &amp; a percentage voting weight will be assigned to each item
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using the output from stage 1, the selection process will be determined by applying a mathematical model we developed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Initial challenges integrating our ML algorithms to the Wix Code since we were using Python. Transferred this over to node.js.
-Design issues around the mobile site, which we were able to fix by implementing changes on the mobile version on Wix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Designing &amp; building something that was usable and, in our opinion, very practical!
                </p>
                <p>
                    -There was a steep learning curve since all the platforms were very new to us. We're very proud of how we were able to pick them up together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Using Wix Code and integrating it with various back-end systems.
-It was our first attempt at building a complex ML algorithm
-Working with a very diverse team from all around the world, with a broad range of skills - this was the best thing we could learn!
                </p>
