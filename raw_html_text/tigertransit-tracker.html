                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The existing eta prediction functionality was dangerously misleading, but only if you wanted accurate information. So, we decided to do our part in the fight against the post-factual-era, and applied machine learning to predict bus ETAs. Afterall as Steve Jobs said, "If you can't trust your bus, then you can't trust your wife." And I think that's beautiful.

                <p>
                    This year Princeton acquired a new plot of land to build a Residential College. We see this as an opportunity to expand. Lets do the math; two years ago, Princeton bought no land. This year, they bought land. Plugging this into an exponential model, we find that Princeton will own the entire land surface area by 2048 (and all the oceans by 2052). Taking these predictions into consideration then, we can confidently claim TigerTransit Tracker app should have a global marketshare within the next half-decade. Math can't lie. That's what's next for TTT. But let's not ask what's "next". Let's ask the more important question, what do we, the developers of TTT treasure. Well, we'll conclude with another Steve Job's quote; "Without bus stuff, we are just cavemen."

                    Over and Out,
  Yours faithfully,
  TTT Playmates ;)
