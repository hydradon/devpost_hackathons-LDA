                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a fan of text-based RPG games, and I thought Alexa would be a cool new type of interface for a classic genre
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an adventure style video game that uses Alexa as a way for the player to interact
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I usually like to use this kind of an application as practice when I'm learning something new, so I've built similar ones before including web-based and Android applications, but I've never made one with random room generation like this, and adapting it to Alexa was definitely a challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't get Eclipse to work with Alexa no matter what I did, so I ended up using Node.js instead, which is part of the reason I adopted the random generation approach. I usually like to store all of the rooms of the game in a HashMap at the start, but that's not as easy to do in JavaScript so I rethought it a bit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't able to get as much functionality into the application as I wanted to in the time I had, I wanted to include an actual battle system for fighting monsters and a proper level up system, but I'm proud of what I did get done, the addition of treasure rooms as a way to win the game was a spur of the moment idea I had an hour or so before the deadline and it turned out pretty good
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how to use Alexa, something I've never worked with before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Based Dungeon Crawler Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a lot of fun to build, I might continue to add features over time
                </p>
