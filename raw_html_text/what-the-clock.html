                    2.5D Side Scrolling platformer with Tetris elements to create your own level. The aim of the game is to collect all the pieces of the broken clock. You win by collecting the pieces and fixing the clock. You collect the pieces by placing giant blocks on the ground (and ontop of each other) to reach certain locations where the clock pieces are.
