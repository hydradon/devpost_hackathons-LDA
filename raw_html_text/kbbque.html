                    Put KBBQ and your desires on hold because your health is too important to be part of your queue of priorities.

                <p>
                    Our web app allows users to visualize routes to reach coffeeshops in Los Angeles through healthy routes such as walking or by bus. The different layers and icons on the map makes it easy for users to sort through the provided data based off their location and ease of access from trails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our web app also serves as a calorie counter for common everyday food items that are consumed. This promotes a healthy lifestyle not just through day-to-day activities, but also through what individuals choose to consume.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Esri SDK to display the basemap, create the various layers for the map, and pinpoint the locations for coffeeshops in LA.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A majority of us are beginners, so we had to spend most of the time actually learning how to write code in Javascript and CSS and understanding the programs we were using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making our first web app and learning JavaScript and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to call APIs and set up a live web app.

                    What's next for KBBQue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand this app so that it can be used in any part of the world by extracting data from a database. We also hope to implement a time-tracking widget that would allow users to track wait times for nearby restaurants and make better decisions in terms of the way they choose to spend their time and lead a healthy lifestyle.
