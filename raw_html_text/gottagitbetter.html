                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to bring information to Lower-income families about local inexpensive health care and public transit.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application streamlines the process of locating inexpensive healthcare facilities and provides every local bus stop and train station through a customize google-maps-api.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the google cloud platform, I built a virtual machine in ubuntu 16.04 LTS and installed an apache2 web server on it.  Robert explored the google maps api and gathered the information he needed to create some javascript code that would create a customized map for us by default.  Nguyen then wrapped the whole thing up in a bootstrap blanket to make it look fancy.  Then Bao put some time in on the app development side of things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the primary challenges we had was with the API, Robert was attempting to ignore certain elements from the normal google maps experience(IE: Remove layers like recommended restaurants etc..).  Nguyen found a way to clear the whole map of every label and Icon and we decided it was easier to just add the few elements we needed, than try to remove the unnecessary clutter one normally runs into with google maps.  In order for some of the api calls to work, I had to have a SSL certificate, meaning our url need to be https, not just http.  So i had to go through the process of adding a DNS (Thanks Domain.com!) and then creating the certificate on my server(this was more difficult than I'm making it out to be).  Once everything was in place the web application would now prompt us to use our location.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not a front end or back end developer, most of my experience is in building desktop applications.  So being able to figure out how to attach a normal url to a web server and even secure it?  That was huge for me!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned more in the last 24 hours than in the last two weeks!  I love these events that puts a time crunch on you and forces you to get creative.  But I did learn some serious techniques to be a successful back-end developer, I'll be using the skills in future research.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fully adapt mobile integration and add some navigation via public transport.
