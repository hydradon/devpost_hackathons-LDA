                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that drones were available to be used, so we were interested in coming up with an application for one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we use the drone to take pictures of the various people's in a room. Then, we use Project Oxford to register the emotions in order to determine the overall mood of the room. We then play a song off a playlist depending on the mood that was found in the room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using node.js and python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems with the camera on the drone, and connection problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most relieving point during the project was actually getting the drone to take pictures that we could save to a computer, so that is probably the biggest accomplishment.
                </p>

                    Node.js.
