                        Developing the Dashboard
                    </strong>
                    We made a basic dashboard screen which displays google map, and
                    <em>
                        On the road
                    </em>
                    shipment order.

                    </strong>
                    We integrated the application with mobile application, and feed real time data into Dashboard screen.
