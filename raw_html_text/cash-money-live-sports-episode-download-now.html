                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we've made good progress against spam on Devpost, it's a never-ending battle between the forces of good and evil. Software built by villains is sold to sleazy marketers who post ads on thousands of legitimate sites with the click of a button. We wanted to look further into what spammers do, and how we can fight them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched spam on Devpost, wrote up some summary points, and made concrete suggestions for how to improve our efforts to fight it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did this research using exports and analytics, but did not access the database, which hampered our efforts to get a representative sample. However, the tools we have did give us adequate insight into what's going on, we think.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now better understand how they're using the platform, and we identified some additional steps we can take to stop spam. We also learned about many nutritional supplements, free torrents, and other things we're ashamed to mention.
                </p>

                    We're not going to tell you, unless you're a Devpost employee with access to the google doc. Sorry! (However, if you know a lot about fighting spam, please let us know and please flag any bad content you come across. Thanks!)
