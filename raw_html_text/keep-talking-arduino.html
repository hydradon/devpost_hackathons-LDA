                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoyed playing the computer party game

                        </em>

                    with our friends and decided that a real-life implementation would be more accessible and interesting. It's software brought to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each randomly generated "bomb" has several modules that must be defused in order to win the game. Here's the catch: only one person can see and interact with the bomb. The other players have the bomb defusal manual to defuse the bomb and must act as "experts," communicating quickly with the bomb defuser. And you only have room for three errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puzzle-solving, communication, and interpretation skills will be put to the test as players race the five-minute clock while communicating effectively. Here are the modules we built:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>

                            <em>
                                Sometimes, information is useful.
                            </em>
                            In this display module, we display the time remaining and the serial number of the bomb. How can you use this information?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                                Wires are the basis of all hardware hacks. But sometimes, you have to pull them out.
                            </em>
                            A schematic is generated, instructing players to set up a variety of colored wires into six pins. There's only one wire to pull out, but which one? Only the "experts" will know, following a series of conditional statements.

                            Decode this strange combination and figure out if the button saying "PRESS" should be pressed, or if you should hold it down and light up another LED.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used six Arduino Unos, with one for each module and one for a central processor to link all of the modules together. Each module is independent, except for two digital outputs indicating the number of strikes to the central processor. On breadboards, we used LEDs, LCD displays, and switches to provide a simple user interface.
