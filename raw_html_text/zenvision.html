                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have faced this problem before - rushing down to a shop only to find that it's closed, opting to take a bus only to find that it is crowded, heading down to a library only to find that there's no seats.
If you hate making wrong choices, then this app is for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects you with strangers, so that they act as your personal CCTV. Simply submit a request with location information and wait for it to be accepted. Anyone who happens to be there can easily snap a shot of the surroundings. You will then anonymously receive the status update of your desired location.
It's like an on-demand CCTV anywhere!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had 2 choices, whether to build a web app or a native app.
However, in the end, we chose a native app for better support of Google Cloud Messaging to push notifications and its location picker service, both of which are critical to our app.
The app connects to a backend server coded in PHP. This is then linked to a SQL database to fetch the best users to process such jobs and send them a notification accordingly.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding in Android is no easy feat for me. Being the solo Android coder in the team, I was from an era where Android 2.3 Gingerbread was the norm. With the new Android Studio, new APIs, new syntax and new quirks, getting this software was no easy task.
I spent quite some time trying to figure out the obscure error messages and had a really hard time debugging!
I had in mind a really nice design, but Android Studio simply refuses to make design as easy as it is on CSS!
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. In fact, I think Android Studio would win the most annoying hack award!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Isn't the ability to use Android Studio an achievement in itself? :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical skills wise, I was able to brush up my competency in Android programming.
I also learnt the importance of teamwork. With only a team of 2, teamwork was important because we relied on each others' input and output to make a coherent app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ZenVision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future for ZenVision is infinite. The use cases can be extended to set up constant monitoring of specific areas, to enable real-time video updates. For example, when a train breaks down, these real-time updates can be used to facilitate information sharing so that all commuters know which stations to avoid.
This can also be implemented on Glass for a seamless experience in which capturing photos and live feed would be a simple command away.
We aim to build a future where Information and Communication forms the core of our daily lives, and this is just a first step!
