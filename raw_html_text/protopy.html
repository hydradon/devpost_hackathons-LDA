                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main objective was to construct something that can be used to program in python through the use of blocks. It's main aim is to facilitate programming instruction and rapid prototyping of python programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program facilitates programming instruction and rapid prototyping of python programs through a drag and drop interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constructed primarily with node-webkit and python for compilation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parent to child communication and choosing the proper data structure to use to represent the data. Parsing the JSON was almost impossible and brought many tears to our hackers and caused raging meltdowns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to take a graph and turn it into legitimate python through the use of a directed graph and BFS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data structures are cool.
                </p>

                    What's next for Protopy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it run smoother and more efficient.
                </p>
