                </h2>

                    So, idea hub is basically inspired by Shark Tank wherein people present their ideas to the investors and if the investors find the idea to be promising, they invest in that idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea hub will help people to post their ideas along with some prototype and the tech stack that they used or propose for the idea. Some of the burning or hot areas of research can also be tagged which can then be rated by a hotness index such as machine-learning, image processing, neural-networks, and all the other topics in AI. For the first round of reviewing other participants can upvote or downvote an idea. Once they do that, during the final stages the judges or the investors can then get a curated list of ideas that can be ranked with relative ease.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tech stack we used for this project included angular at the frontend, spring framework for the backend, and used an in-memory database h2 for database interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging task was to find an algorithm that can help us devise a score for ranking based on the number of upvotes and downvotes. Also, I had not been in touch with Angular for a while and therefore, we found it difficult to come up with a frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with a basic web application that has minimal frontend and backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development is a continuous and extensive effort. Therefore, the skills that are acquired need continuous practice and diligence to be fluent in writing code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for idea-hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have a GitHub repository for idea hub, the extensive functionality required to fulfill what this idea is supposed to do will be implemented.
