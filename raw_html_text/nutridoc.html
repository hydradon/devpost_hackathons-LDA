                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After speaking to a doctor who wanted better insight into patients aside from just the health aspect, our team thought of NutriDoc. A website that will give doctors a basic online intake (under patients' permission) and any other personal details, stress, or something good they want to share with the doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The doctor we spoke to mentioned he'd like to learn more about his patients, and understand sometimes it may get busy at the office and doctors and patients may not have the best time to chat. The online tool will have a chatting option for patients and doctors to chat (free for patients) and is beneficial to the doctors because they will learn about their patient and a deeper level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used very basic web tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use many APIs, however, we were unable to implement them due to the limited time. The project idea kept changing as we were trying to make it reasonable for users and at times, we were unsure what to do next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of is the idea of the project and that it could be put to use to help people in their local community. We're that there is a chatbot feature that could provide more direct care remotely to patients.

                    What's next for NutriDoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working on this project and integrate many web tools. We want to ensure that both patients get the resources in the simplest form to be better informed in approaching nutritional health which will also improve their mental health. We also want to ensure that doctors have easy and smooth access to patient information, under permission of patient, get a better understanding of the patient at the health and a little on the personal level, and eventually treat them at their offices.
