                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was Nessie (Capital One's API). It gave us the idea to give a simple yet reliable data visualization web app to give companies some insight as to customer status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It collects data from the API, represents it as a clickable list, which leads you to that customer's financial information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Nessie API to create and collect dummy data (customers, accounts and transactions)
A python script runs within a controller in web2py and parses the json data obtained from the API
Oh, and Nessie also served as a database for our customers (Yes, Nessie is that cool)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a huge challenge with web2py, which doesn't support python 3. So we had a hard time debugging the whole system only to find that out. Then we needed to delete python 3 and replace it with python 2 to be successful.
The second challenge was to implement the data from the api in actual charts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the handling of the API, which we thought was going to be our biggest challenge but turned out to be the easiest part of the project _ eventually _. We're also proud of getting the website to run the main page successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a good opportunity to practice python, some nice web development, and even learn API's handling in general since it is a big part of programming nowadays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AnalyticsOne
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be pretty cool to implement a machine algorithm to predict the spending trends of the customer (yeah ... we are far from that, but still love the idea)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working on future projects together in software development to further our knowledge of it and get experience for possible internships/job opportunities.
