                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide nutrition facts to users in a simple and systematic manner, and allows users to visuallize their caloric intake
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android app keeps track of the food you consume and will provide you with nutrition info about them, as well as how much calories you've consumed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio as the IDE for building the android application, and we used the FatSecrets REST API to provide information about the various foods. For database, we connected our application with Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The FatSecrets API was very hard to use, and setting up HTTP requests was a pain. The UI was also a struggle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the organization of REST API, as well as database querying and mobile application development in general.
                </p>

                    What's next for Calorie Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add machine learning algorithms that keep track of users' eating habits and will provide recommendations as to which foods to consume.
