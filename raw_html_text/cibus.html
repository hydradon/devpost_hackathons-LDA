                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each year, over approximately 1.3 billion tonnes of produced food is wasted ever year, a startling statistic that we found to be truly unacceptable, especially for the 21st century. The impacts of such waste are wide spread, ranging from the millions of starving individuals around the world that could in theory have been fed with this food to the progression of global warming caused by the greenhouse gases released as a result of emissions from decaying food waste. Ultimately, the problem at hand was one that we wanted to fix using an application, which led us precisely to the idea of Cibus, an application that helps the common householder manage the food in their fridge with ease and minimize waste throughout the year.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, our app works in two ways. First, the app uses image processing to take pictures of receipts and extract the information from it that we then further process in order to identify the food purchased and the amount of time till that particular food item will expire. This information is collectively stored in a dictionary that is specific to each user on the app. The second thing our app does is sort through the list of food items that a user has in their home and prioritize the foods that are closest to expiry. With this prioritized list, the app then suggests recipes that maximize the use of food that is about to expire so that as little of it goes to waste as possible once the user makes the recipes using the ingredients that are about to expire in their home.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We essentially split the project into front end and back end work. On the front end, we used iOS development in order to create the design for the app and sent requests to the back end for information that would create the information that needed to be displayed on the app itself. Then, on the backend, we used flask as well as Cloud9 for a development environment in order to compose the code necessary to help the app run. We incorporated image processing APIs as well as a recipe API in order to help our app accomplish the goals we set out for it. Furthermore, we were able to code our app such that individual accounts can be created within it and most of the functionalities of it were implemented here. We used Google Cloud Vision for OCR and Microsoft Azure for cognitive processing in order to implement a spell check in our app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the challenges initially derived from identifying the scope of the program and how far we wanted to take the app. Ultimately, we were able to decide on an end goal and we began programming. Along the way, many road blocks occurred including how to integrate the backend seamlessly into the front end and more importantly, how to integrate the image processing API into the app. Our first attempts at the image processing API did not end as well as the API only allowed for one website to be searched at a time for at a time, when more were required to find instances of all of the food items necessary to plug into the app. We then turned to Google Cloud Vision, which worked well with the app and allowed us to identify the writing on receipts.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to report that the app works and that a user can accurately upload information onto the app and generate recipes that correspond to the items that are about to expire the soonest. Ultimately, we worked together well throughout the weekend and are proud of the final product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that integrating image processing can be harder than initially expected, but manageable. Additionally, we learned how to program an app from front to back in a manner that blends harmoniously such that the app itself is solid on the interface and in calling information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cibus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There remain a lot of functionalities that can be further optimized within the app, like number of foods with corresponding expiry dates in the database. Furthermore, we would in the future like the user to be able to take a picture of a food item and have it automatically upload the information on it to the app.
