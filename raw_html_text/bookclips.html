                    Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever read a (paper) book and wanted to quickly safe a clip for later.
On a eReader you can simple mark and store. On paper, not so much. You can 
use a marker to highlight parts, but how about finding your clips back later on?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Book Clips is a mobile app which allows you to take a picture of the section you
want to clip. On top of that, it will also analyze and tag your clip with important 
items in there, such as locations and dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Technical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is built using AWS API's. It uses Rekognition to find text and Comprehend
to analyze the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        note
                    </em>
                    : Rekognition has a limit of 50 words, so you can't scan a full page. I'm 
working on a workaround for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Current state
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is not yet available in the app store. I first want to extend the stored
data to also contain the book title and page number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also still a lot of debug information being output to the console and it's
not very capable of dealing with error conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is currently no S3 bucket cleanup code, which is potentially expensive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you want to work on this application, you'll need the latest Ionic version 
installed. All other requirements will be installed automatically when you first
run the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also need an AWS account with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An S3 bucket to store pictures before they are analyzed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some credential source, for instance a Cognito identity pool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A role that has access to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                read/write access to your S3 bucket
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                rekognition:DetectText
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                comprehend:DetectEntities
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You could use your own root account for a quick test, but do not release your root
API key to the public in an app!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the use of the camera, the only way to fully test this is in an emulator 
or on a real device, so this cannot be run in a browser (Please let me know if you 
know how to use the laptop camera.)
                </p>
