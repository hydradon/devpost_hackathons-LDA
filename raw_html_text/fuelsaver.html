                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The common commuter uses gallon after gallon of fuel without a second thought. We've designed a tool that helps the user track the amount of fuel they've saved through the use of alternative transportation. The goal is to make every user more conscious of their fuel usage, and even more conscious of how easy it is to save fuel. 

This app was designed with the consumer in mind by incentivizing one to save gasoline through a progress bar and achievements. FuelSaver has the potential to easily partner up with companies, which will provide our users with even more benefits. In the future there will be a Marketplace, where users can exchange points (earned from reaching saving milestones) for prizes such as giftcards, coupons, or discounts!

FuelSaver was built using Android Studio and Redbull. The initial challenge in developing FuelSaver was that no one on our team had ever developed an android app before! While we got the hang of the development rather quickly, the major challenge we faced was automatically detecting the user's activity, and differentiating between modes of travel. We overcame this challenge through the accidental discovery of documentation of an API (which was key to our development), and a good deal of 3am trial and error. 

Our team is thrilled with many of our accomplishments this weekend. Firstly, that our app works! Beginning with no knowledge of developing android applications and leaving with a functioning product is very exciting. That we also developed a finely tuned tool capable of differentiating between modes of transportation is an accomplishment we are very pleased with. 

FuelSaver is an app that we hope will become a small facet of peoples everyday lives. Our users could cut down on gasoline usage, and we as a whole can cut down the damage we are causing our planet. Our hope is to give the user an incentive to think twice about about their daily choice to drive their cars, and make thinking Green a little more fun.
