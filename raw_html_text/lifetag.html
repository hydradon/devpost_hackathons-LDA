                    Triage &ndash; the process of quickly categorizing casualties based on the severity of their wounds.
So in the current state, when there are mass casualties, the process of triage consists of placing color coded tags on people until everyone is categorized. Only then, are people sent to hospitals in the order of their severity. This is a slow and tedious process where hospitals do not know the symptoms until people reach the hospital.
