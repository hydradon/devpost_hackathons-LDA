                    The high number of intrusions and home invasions occurring and a desire to stop them.

                    Detects motion and changes sound accordingly
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using Arduino and a motion sensor and our knowledge of coding and a  motor.

                    Defective hardware and figuring out how to change the sound of the device

                <p>
                    We learnt about how hardware and software are connected and their importance to one another.

                    Developing it further and making the motion sensing better .
