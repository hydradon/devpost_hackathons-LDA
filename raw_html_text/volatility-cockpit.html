                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seemed like pretty fun challenge to work on.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone can input a stock, and it will generate a graph for volatility and price, P&amp;L, as well as showing some of the Greeks.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beacon.io has a custom IDE and platform where all the code was written.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Black Scholes model was returning zero. Variance calculator would fail -- and needed to try/excepted -- about halfway through the prices.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphs look okay
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about option pricing.
