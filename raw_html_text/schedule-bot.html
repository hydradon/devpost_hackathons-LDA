                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Schedule Builder for course registration is a pain! The website is laid out poorly, and each quarter requires endless scrolling back and forth to find classes that don't conflict with each other. We know what classes we need; why isn't registration automated?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedule Bot is a program that takes in the course codes of classes, runs it across the database, and creates a conflict free schedule for you. At the moment, the database is a mock database, but in the future it would be great to work with actual UC Davis scheduling data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was coded in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult keeping code organized. As we worked on the project, we would need to add new functions to the program and would sometimes struggle to adapt the rest of the program to the added code. We also spent much of the hackathon trying to explore creating web or mobile apps, something we have no experience in. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get a start on such a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schedule Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to add visuals and more options, such as preferences for classes at times of day, days of the week, or if a person prefers to have classes next to each other or spread out throughout the day. It would also be great to make this an actual application or a Chrome extension, instead of just a Java program.
