                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members had a sibling that did not enjoy doing homework because of the difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our skill helps kids to do their homework by solving math and spelling problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the AWS Lambda and Amazon Developer Console to set up the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with setting up our Math function and getting it to convert a string to a math equation that JavaScript could solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was really proud when we got our app to run for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was able to learn a new method called the eval() method which solves a math problem in a string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Homework Helper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to add more problems that kids would ask to the app.
                </p>
