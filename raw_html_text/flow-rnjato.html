                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build something that I knew I would find beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flow has two modes, one for studying and one for social media. The study mode provides resources for productivity and will eventually contain a series of motivational quotes and a to-do list. When the user is done working, they can switch into the social mode. This mode will have links to Youtube, Steam, Reddit and other fun sites. It's all about convenience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Flow in Webstorm using a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came into this Hackathon only knowing languages that were not optimal for bringing my vision to life. The idea for Flow came after the hacking began and I dedicated myself to learning as much as I could about web development in the time allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm honestly proud to have something that looks nice considering that I have never done this before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Google, Stack Overflow and Youtube are excellent resources. The technical problems I encountered along the way made me better at searching things up, problem solving and finding solutions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flow will be further developed in the months ahead to become a full web app.
