                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dispenses medication in controlled amounts. Reads medication labels. Sends notifications reminders. Uses a medication query API to determine information about a specific medication in the system.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through an iterative process of brainstorm: first we developed a rough prototype in which we aimed to lay the groundwork for the fundemental features of the project; then an app was developed to control the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything, especially that we didn't have parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding said resources/parts to create a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bring parts next time.

                    What's next for pill.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Global domination. In terms of in-home pill dispensaries of course.
