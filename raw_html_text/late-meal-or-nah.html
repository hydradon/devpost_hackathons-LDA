                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As new Princeton freshmen, we were constantly checking the dining hall hours page to see if it was late meal. We wanted to make the process easier and quicker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple as it may be, the webpage tells you whether it is currently late meal or not. It also tells you how much time until late meal begins or ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and JavaScript. The domain came courtesy of domain.com and hosting is through Linode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no prior experience in HTML, JavaScript, webpage domains, and hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a webpage that works(?).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of HTML, JavaScript, webpage domains, and hosting.
                </p>

                    What's next for Late Meal Or Nah?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beta testing, and maybe usage by the next freshman class.
