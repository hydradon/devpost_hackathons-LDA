                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of developers use and love Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code also happens to built on NodeJS (using Electron) and is highly portable to Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It also provides many built in capabilities for integrating languages and language support functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial version of this extension is very simple. It provides basic syntax highlighting support for Cypher files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the existing VS Code extensions from Jake Boone and Ionut Botizan and extended from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the fundamentals of writing VS Code extensions requires an investment of time. Figuring out how to actually publish an extension in the marketplace also requires an investment of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I actually was able to jump through all of the hurdles Microsoft throws up to actually publish a simple extension in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of constructing a VS Code language extension. I will build off this knowledge in the future to continue enhancing this extension.
                </p>

                    What's next for Visual Studio Code Cypher Query Langauge Tools for Neo4j
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A pretty ambitious roadmap is available in the project README.md file in the GitHub repository. I actually do plan to implement this functionality-hopefully with the collaboration of other members of the Neo4j community.
