                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Guitar Guru uses the Myo armband to track muscle movements, mainly the brachioradials and the carpi radialis. The pointer on the web application follows a specific tempo for each song, allowing users to follow the beat. When they manage to hit the note on the correct beat, the app lets you know. It then tracks the information for he user and presents analysis at the end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
