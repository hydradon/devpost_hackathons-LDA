                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found out that though there are lots of 'guided meditation' apps/skills, none is for guiding us to study properly!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes your boring study a fun and challenging task!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I researched the best method to study. I found that it is through Pomodoro technique by taking short breaks. I practiced few iterations of the planned guided study and finally came up with this Study Hack. I took the help of Audacity for making the audio &amp; used lambda for making an audio player skill and hosted it in Amazon AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this skill, making the audio was crucial as it is a single invocation skill. Selecting the right background music, timing, speech was quite challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The positive reviews I got from the users. One user even asked me to make a similar app for iOS :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process, I learned Audacity, making audio as per Alexa requirements, hosting the lambda function in amazon AWS, using the AWS S3, and many successful challenging study sessions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to make the skill more smart. With interaction with the user, It should configure itself its background music, could monitor number of sessions, and could warn if one is over doing there rest period during Study Sessions.
