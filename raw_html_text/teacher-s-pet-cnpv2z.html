                    We were inspired by large classrooms and sometimes lack of teacher-student interaction. In order to bridge communication between teachers and students, we built a web application that allows students to ask questions anonymously. Our program will then filter questions based on NLP to remove duplicates and disruptive questions and once the professor asks Alexa if the class has any questions, the Alexa will present the professor with questions with priority queues.

                <p>
                    With this, we hope that class structure will be data-driven, focused on what the students are struggling with, providing the class with a more comprehensive syllabus and the professor with a better knowledge of how to help the students.
