                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are TAs for the Computer Science department. We are frustrated by the way of our office hours executed. Therefore, we want to make it better

                <p>
                    There are two options: student and instructors. Students can add entries into the queue and wait for their turn to be helped. The intructors have the option of poping the queue and add student back in the queue in case of that student is not done being helped.
