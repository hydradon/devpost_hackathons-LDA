                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bunny Hole BI is a web interface that provides easy-to-understand statistics to merchants based on their transaction history. A quick glance allows business owners to immediately understand when their business hits peak popularity during the day, and closer inspection of color-keyed revenue sources allows merchants to gain insight on consumer purchasing patterns as well as identify their most-valuable products. No auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity involved!

                    D3.js --- A powerful data visualization library in Javascript that can provide for bespoke and insightful visualizations.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lack experience in the fine details of web development (but not in thoughtful design!). Along the journey of building Bunny Hole BI, we had issues implementing our desired toolkit of API calls. We'll be better prepared next time! That isn't to say we're not proud of Bunny Hole BI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bunny Hole BI is actually useful. We also managed to implement some pretty cool animations! It can function on a live stream of data. Bunny Hole BI is a truly usable business dashboard.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No project implementation will ever be truly seamless. The world of clouds and smart machines has ways of complicating things, when you'd rather they just be complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bunny Hole BI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bunny Hole BI's team hopes to take it onto a truly live and stable platform with user accounts and a more powerful tools for analyzing the data in order to present a better finished data product to the business-owner.
