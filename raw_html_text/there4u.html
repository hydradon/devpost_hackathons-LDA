                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times students stressed out in college go to social media to vent their feelings. This application promotes positive mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application displays random tweets that were characterized by the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API as sad or depressed. The user can anonymously respond to these tweets and a bot can push the response out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a Python + MongoDB backend, we used the tweepy python library to poll tweets, and used the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer RESTful interface to receive tone analysis data. We then stored tweets characterized as sad or depressed with a threshold level of greater than 50% into our MongoDB database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frontend was created with ReactJS, and communicated with API endpoints established on the Python server.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did encounter the occasional bug when writing backend and frontend code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're happy to have been able to complete this application within the 36 hours.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about pacing ourselves.
