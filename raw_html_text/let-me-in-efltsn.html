                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine this: you're at the Ubahn station and after several minutes of waiting, finally your train arrives. However, nearly all the cars are filled with people and you just can't get in! This can/has possibly been a common occurrence for any of us during peak hours of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is to give you, a passenger waiting at the station, an overview of the capacity of the cars of the incoming train. This way you see which cars are too full to enter and which ones are less filled and easier accessible. From this, you decide what part of the platform to strategically position yourself in order to access a less crowded car or to wait for the next train
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application was built using OpenVino, OpenCV, Python and on top of base code provided by Intel

                    <li>
                        Inaccessibility to ready data hence we had to create these ourselves by going into the Ubahn to film videos for image detection

                    <li>
                        The fluctuation in the number of segmentation per frame

                        Image detection didn't not work for people obscured by a glass panel

                    <li>
                        Drawings on posters in the trains were detected as well
