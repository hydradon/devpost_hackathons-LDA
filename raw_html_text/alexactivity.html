                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here, we're all procrastinators at heart. That's why getting things done is sometimes impossible and always difficult. Alexactivity is based on the scientifically backed Pomodoro (Italian for tomato) technique for time management and productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pomodoro technique involves 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of break. Studies have shown that such breaks helped to increase both motivation and concentration on tasks. Unlike other apps, Alexactivity both features distraction blocking in the form of blacklisted sites and a compatible skill on the Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to create an algorithm that would take in inputs of tasks on a user's to-do list and allocate it through a timer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with the organization of our team. With a team with diverse skillsets that were applicable to different aspects of this project. Using the whiteboard, drawing out our ideas helped us to visualize our plans. Coming from many people with different plans, we spent a fair chunk of time brainstorming. With several rejected ideas (communist dating sim anybody?) we were able to combine our interests into Alexactivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of being able to pull together as much as we did, with a project that is decidedly functional. We had fun and graphed our plans onto the whiteboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about python GUI packages, Alexa skills, productivity methods, and site blocking a local machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexactivity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we are likely to improve the customization options of the project (break time, task order) as well as implement new features (task prioritization, setting a 'daily' schedule). Moving on, we could also improve on the parts of this product that may be a bit lacking, especially in visuals and Alexa integration.
