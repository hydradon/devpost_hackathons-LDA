                    . Most of transport information's like fair cost, pricing, bus arrival and departure time of various agencies can change over time. how can those changes be reflected for users to see. if we build a static app by mere picking few static info. so we created a system that can allow all agencies to add and modify all available information. all this info are available to all users accessing the app. If you are a taxi agency like Uber, you can visit

                    Mexico City has numerous carbon emission issues which leads to some companies shutting down their automobile plants when carbon emission
in the city is at its peak. I discovered that this is due to excessive vehicle on the roads coupled with industrial automobile plants leading to high combustion of
 Petroleum which causes emission. how can
this carbon emission be drastically minimized...

                    Yes Dear, You know too many vehicle on the road was due to lack of proper Multi-modal transport in the city as Citizens/Visitors 
moves about going for their endearvours ranging from office work,looking for Taxi,Buses, looking for Parking Lots,going to Hospital for Medical Checkup,looking Hotels to Lodge, Restaurants
to buy food.
                    <br>
                    To tackle this emission issues, to minimized too many vehicle on the roads, to ensure a good multi-modal system and to ensure that people travel only when they need 
to do so. Mexico City needs a good Decentralized Database System that takes care of this.
