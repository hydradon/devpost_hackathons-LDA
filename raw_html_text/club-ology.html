                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clubs need a platform in order to communicate their schedules and other events to their members. Personally, for our school, clubs tend to be disorganized and meeting dates are subject to change. Thus, we've decided to plan an app to address the issues we experience in our every-day lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app facilitates the organization of clubs among the student community and promotes the joining and sharing of different organizations. It additionally oversees notifications from clubs in which the user has joined!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built the IOS app using the Apple programming language Swift and it's compiler XCODE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team experienced a variety of challenges in creating this project. First of all, none of our team members had previously used Swift or programmed an IOS app, so it was difficult to familiarize ourselves with the new language and layout within 24 hours. Another challenge was learning and understanding the multiple aspects of XCODE in order to perform the actions we wished to perform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment that we are proud of is enabling push notifications outside the app. Another achievement included the facilitation of registering a user and saving their information for login purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our project, we gained a better understanding of the Swift language and it's capabilities. During 24 hours, we were able to adapt ourselves to a whole new language and challenge ourselves through this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Club-ology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand our app to more schools and students around the world by enabling club officers to create a club and advertise it among their school. We also have ideas to enable reservations on upcoming club events.
