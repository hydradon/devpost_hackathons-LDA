                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help people that don't know how to program or create a website easily draw it out on paper and make it a reality

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses computer vision &amp; google cloud vision to distinguish the rectangles and read the text and send it as a Json to the swift macOS app to create a react project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We built it using many libraries and classic computer vision
