                    We were eagar to learn new technogolies at LA Hacks. We came in with an idea for an educational app involving conversing with AI. We started working with Google DialogFlow and Firebase but we did not have an adequate amount of time to implement on all our ideas. We had to rehash our ideas and come up with a Web App that was more manageable in the amount of time we were given. So we changed the technologies we were using to something we were more comfortable with and did something on a smaller scale. That is how we came to our app.
