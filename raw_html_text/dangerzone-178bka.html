                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a lot of information about being prepared and dealing with natural disasters that most people would not consider in those situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app provides information on how to prepare and survived natural disasters. By providing them with the necessary information of recognizing the signs to emergency kits to have made beforehand.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create our very own Android app and edited all our graphics in GIMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we ran into complications surrounding the styling of buttons in Android Studio through their respective xml files. Implementing a navigation drawer and fragments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    It works and provides the needed information in categories for better readability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to do workarounds to get past giant hurdles. As well as not to implement things that we are not sure how they work.
