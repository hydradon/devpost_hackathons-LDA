                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The influential political figure Harambe was the sole inspiration for this project. We all felt personally affected by the loss of this great Western lowland gorilla. In an effort to preserve his legacy, we created "Save the Children," an interactive multimedia experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user visits the website, harambae.org, where they are immediately greeted by a visually pleasing welcome screen, featuring images of our inspiration, Harambe. The site gives the user a multitude of ways to learn more about his Majesty. The site includes an embedded Twitter widget featuring relevant memes and quotes from and about this political leader. Furthermore, there is an informational video describing the events leading up to his death, and the repercussions it had on society. Perhaps most importantly, there is an interactive simulation allowing the user to enjoy the definitive Harambe experience. This impressively high-resolution game simulates Harambe's final moments, before he was so cruelly taken from us. The keyboard is used to move the protagonist, as he avoids the onslaught of bullets from the zookeeper. In addition, the user must deftly navigate the zoo enclosure in order to save as many children as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All images were created or heavily edited using GIMP. We'd like to thank GIMP for providing such an easy-to-use interface and friendly customer experience. We created the game using Phaser and Javascript. The website uses HTML, CSS, the Twitter API, and jQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was the sprite sheet. We ran into several issues with ensuring transparency between the figures, and separating them so artifacts from neighboring figures did not appear as part of the active sprite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We formed a team of four members who had never met before. We successfully divided responsibilities, then worked together to combine all the parts of the beautiful tribute we created. We are especially proud that this tribute allows the user to not only learn more about our inspiration, but also experience what his final moments were like. This allows the user to gain empathy for this poor gorilla's struggles, as they can now truly relate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Phaser, some new CSS tricks, advanced image editing, how to create sprite sheets, and even more about this influential political figure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Save the Children
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next iteration would be an interactive, Virtual reality experience allowing the user to relive Harambe's final moments and witness them through the eyes of our hero himself, the child, the zookeeper, or a spectator.
