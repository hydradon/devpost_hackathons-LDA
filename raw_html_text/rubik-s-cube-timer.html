                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've enjoyed speedcubing or competitively solving Rubik's cubes for over two years, but have always been disappointed with the design of many timing websites. I thought I could do better, but I never really knew anything about making a program like that, until this hackathon gave me the opportunity to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is primarily a timer for solving Rubik's cubes and provides  a scramble algorithm in order to ensure that each solve is fair. It also has a text box for recording your best times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to write most of it from the workshops I attended here, as well as searching online. I started off by writing the HTML and planning out what sort of buttons and boxes I would need. I then moved on to the CSS and started to think about what the design would be, because that was the main thing I wanted to improve. Finally, I implemented the JavaScript and tried to get all of the features to work together.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I ran into was trying to understand and write the JavaScript because I had never seen it before. I also had a large amount of difficulty trying to get the time to display.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able get the program to run by continuously trying new things, as well as continuing to work on it and improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What the difference is between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how they all work together. Also what is involved in running the front and backend of a website.
