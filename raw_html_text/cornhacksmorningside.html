                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using premade tools such as Logger Pro 3 is typically pricy, as well as cumbersome to use. OpenGraph can take in any serial data stream from an Ardiuno or Raspberry Pi and convert it into a graph that easy to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenGraph takes in a stream of serial data via USB and the plots the data points in relation to time. Since the dat is coming in via USB, it is a standardized input that will allow any serial steam from a data sensor to be put in, allowing for any sensor such as an ultrasonic or force sensor. It also calculates the statistics for the data it has received, such as mean, median and mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python 3.7.0 to take in the data from the Arduino sensors, and then Tkinter and matplotlib to make the UI and graph respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The serial data coming in had to be converted into a usable for for our software. It was trick to get it to not run forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data can be successfully be read in from the Ardiuno serial bus and the translated into the graph with little hitching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that real time grpahing is extremely difficult to do, and while Pythin is powerful, you must do things is a sort of roundabout way to get somethings to work
