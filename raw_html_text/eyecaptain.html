                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was the University of Sussex's work in the field of advanced ECG sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a electrooculograph built from a few cheap electronic components and an Arduino&mdash;it tracks eye movement by measuring the potential difference between the cornea and the retina.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A the potential difference between a pair of electrodes is amplified by an instrumentation amplifier, then passed through a couple of simple filters. An Arduino then reads this signal and performs some further processing, before sending the value over serial to the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original circuit was far too complex, and difficult to debug. In the end, we pushed a lot of filtering into software, and it seems to have paid off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EyeCaptain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whilst EyeCaptain itself is just a proof of concept, it demonstrates that devices such as EOGs are actually very simple in design, and can be used to provide hardware accessibility to seriously disabled people.
