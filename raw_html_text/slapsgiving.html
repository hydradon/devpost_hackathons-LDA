                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simon Says alone?
                    <em>
                        Boring.
                    </em>
                    Making it wireless? Better but not quite. The loser gets slapped? Now we're talking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 players compete with the same Simon code, with anyone that messes up getting a slap. If both players get it right, the winner is who did it faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two computers connect to each other through a direct TCP connection, with the entire interactive device controlled through an Arduino &amp; build set per person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main issues we ran into, down to the last minutes was having the computer send the key Simon code to the Arduino to display it for the players. Besides that, differing coding styles led to some compatibility issues between our different programmers.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The TCP connection giving the option to play with a friend over long distance.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep is important.
