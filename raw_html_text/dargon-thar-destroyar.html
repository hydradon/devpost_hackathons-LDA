                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of shadow puppets or sock puppets inspired us to use Magic Leap hand controls to puppeteer a character around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using hand recognition and eye tracking, the player controls a dragon that rampages around the countryside to burn villagers, sheep, and thatch-roof cottages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Magic Leap, we tried each mechanic separately, then merged and it all fell apart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many intermittent issues with the Magic Leap and it's simulator. General issues with understanding what we were trying to recognize with Magic Leap (Hands, Gestures, Planes, Eye tracking).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The silliness of destroying things goes with the art really well...when it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There needs to be something better than the current source control for hackathons. :)
                </p>

                    Eventually he will get attacked from higher planes, and use a different gesture to fly and take out fortresses.
