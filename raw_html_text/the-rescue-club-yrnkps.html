                <p>
                    I was in Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Andrew, and also lost everything I owned in Hurricane Ike. To see major incidents happening, people losing their homes, their lives. It makes me feel the same way I felt when I was homeless for 9 months because of Hurricane Ike. And we want to help those people.

                    The Rescue Club focuses on relief efforts, and management of rescuers/volunteers to rescue people in need. By providing Realtime Information, and Communication. This System utilizes more then 5 Different APIs, across Multitude of Platforms. Utilizing both Hardware, Software to Help those in Need.

                        Utilizing Angular.js for a Fast and Quick Responsive Site, we used Twitter Bootstrap for the Visual Component.

                    <p>
                        MapQuest handled all our Map Overlay Portions, by utilizing Socket.io as created a Realtime Overlay specificly for MapQuest, to allow for Rescuers to check  "Locations" which have been registered for Assistance from the Public as well as from those at those Locations in need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cisco Spark was utilized to handle all of our Text, Voice, and Large Scale Communications. This allows our Volunteers, and Managers of those Volunteers to get Connected Quickly, by either Voice, Video, or Text. By using Twilio we were able to Bridge Communication to SMS incase the Volunteers, or Managers were unable to use Internet on their Phones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We created a Set of Bindings for Java to allow for Android Webviews to Control Harman Products directly from a Website. Giving direct Information, and Notifications in realtime thanks to Socket.io and Javascript. This allowed, for Directions, Notifications, and even Messages from Cisco Spark to be Utilized directly from the Website, and onto the Harman Pulse 2, and Harman Everest Elite700

                        The Features are insane, facebook messanger bot combined with data which is added into our FAQ Data Model, is fed into Watson to give people Accurate information, on their needs and question. We also combined this directly with Twilio to allow a SMS Varation of this same System to be used. For Kicks.

                        Implementation of the YaaS Micro-Transaction System to allow for Anonymous Payments, to those who are Victims in a Crisis, from anyone from around the World. The Idea was to give people the ability to help others, they may not be here to clear someone out of the rubble, and donations to Charity Organizations arent always used correctly. This gives people the Ability to Donate directly to those in need, to those in a crisis. When it really Counts the Most. This system is not ment for Business Transactions, only for Donations to Direct Individuals during the Crisis and Afterwords.

We loved the GPS Module &lt;3 And the Screen did allow us to display information, and Communications errors, along with our amount of Requests, Sent, and the Socket.io Connection Data Pool Size.

                <p>
                    Over the Course of the Hackathon we Got the System running and Functional. It wasnt untill after the Hackathon we Started to Work on Getting it Polished, and Reinforced. It took alot of reading Documentation, thankfully most of us have used a majority of the Services before. We utilized Node.js, Angular.js Socket.io, along with Android Studio, and Atom to complete this Project. And now we are utilizing them again to make it even better.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Alot of DNS Issues, several hours with Support on Domain.com and alot of headaches with how cold it was at the hackathon, at one point in time we were so cold we got into shivers, unable to type only to put our hands into our shirts to keep warm. Thankfully that only wasted about 2-3 hours of our time. Learning how to make Java to Javascript bindings was a whole nother thing. Along with Implementing of Harman Java APIs to Javascript that was fun.

On your Android Device. As well as Focus on getting the Domain for TheRescue.Club moved to GoDaddy to Ensure the DNS isnt a issue, and Launch the Site Live! Publishing of "The Rescue Club" onto the Google Play Marketplace, and work on a iOS Build to duplicate the Harman Integration like we did on Android.
