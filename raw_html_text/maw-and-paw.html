                    Maw and Paw started as a multidisciplinary company analyzing cultures in regards to the affects of consumerism and found itself focusing on health technology for augmenting more mindful experiences.  The goal is provide a richer mental wellbeing through monitoring for anxiety and blood glucose management.  On a daily basis, we continuously reflect on and consume products from media outlets affecting your wellbeing which could lead to health issues.  As an example, southern regions of the United States have an increasing rate of diabetes for consumers.  Because of this, southern regions are statistically at a higher risk of developing diabetes which leads to a shorter lifespans across various ethnicities.  A study by John Hopkins University shows a link between diabetes and mental stress which can lead to higher risks of acquiring neurological problems such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Dementia, Parkinson&rsquo;s, and Huntington&rsquo;s disease.  As this is a spreading epidemic in southern regions, we&rsquo;re meeting those who are at risk halfway by focusing the attention on using their dog as a way to provide a bluetooth connected dog collar.  As a preventive measure, it provides management of glucose hypertensive attacks and mental stress disorders using Arduino and Emotiv hardware.
