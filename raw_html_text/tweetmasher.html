                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google translate can garble the meaning when translating. What if you had it bounce between different languages and back to English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the tweets from the hash tag #HackCU and runs them though Google translate a bunch before replying to that tweet the mashed up tweet.
the bot is @mlghackerbot

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took the twitter API and Google's Cloud platform translate feature and put them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is more them one python implantation of the twitter API. Some do things better then others. So I ended up using two.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud about the turnaround from idea with no experience with Google cloud or the Twitter API how it could get off the ground so quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a little bit of code you can do something pretty cool
                </p>

                    What's next for TweetMasher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TweetMasher will be shut down. But from it the knowledge about the Twitter API and Google cloud will be used in later projects.
