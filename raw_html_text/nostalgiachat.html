                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We miss PictoChat. The Nintendo DS local chat application was a great inspiration for this project.
The art is modeled after the application as well as some of the functionality. We thought it would be nice to have the same thing on a PC or mobile device since there does not seem to be any chat applications that allow you to easily send drawings to people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can send drawings and messages to your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used WebSockets with a React application as well as some other stuff. The messages are sent and updated in real-time on all connected clients
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no idea what we were doing for most of this project. Most of the project was made from scratch because we did know how to do it any other way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used most of these technologies before this project and we managed to get something that works decently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about React and javascript as well as WebSockets since we had not extensively used those tools before.
                </p>

                    Make it look prettier, add more features.
