                    We are Journey42 (journey for two): a website that matches you with a person who also want to travel to your dream city. 
Browse through a list of locations you want to go for the next vacation, add them to your list, and match with somebody with the same destination. Chat with them, become friends, and go on a journey together!

                    The Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traveling is a enriching experience. We recognize that there are people who want to travel around the world but don't want to travel alone. So we wanted to help those people and connect them through this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement machine learning and AI to automate the process and output a list of recommended users with similar geographical interests instead of having to search up a specific location. 
Additionally, we will implement time as well, where people can specify the time frame they're free, and it would make the matching more fit. 
Security is also a big aspect to consider. In the future, we will require people who sign up to verify personal information by providing phone number, a real photo, and a form of ID.
