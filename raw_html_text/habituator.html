                    Inspiration &amp; What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Habituator is a web app created with the goal of helping users follow through with their habits. On average, it takes 66 days to form a habit, but we need a way to help incentivize and track our progress. By checking in every day, we can create lifelong habits and motivate people to form the habits they&rsquo;ve always wanted to reinforce. Users can track as many habits as they&rsquo;d like and check in daily to ensure they&rsquo;re keeping up with their goals. Once a user has checked in for 66 consecutive days, they&rsquo;ve successfully formed a habit and completed their goal. The Habituator is a simple yet effective tool that emphasizes the importance of consistency in building skills and other habits.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React, we created a client-side web application that stores the habits in the browser&rsquo;s localStorage and allows users to check in daily to measure consistency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React was a new framework for us, so it required a lot of learning in order to adapt our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills for this project. As a result, something that should be rather easy to implement, took a good amount of time to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we&rsquo;re proud of is that we were able to create a functioning prototype of our product, despite the challenges we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively utilize the React Framework to create a web-app. In addition, we learned how to implement Semantic UI React into our code. This helped us to style our code using JavaScript tools. Above all else, we learned how to produce a product with a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Habituator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the user&rsquo;s data is stored locally on the browser. This means that clearing the localStorage on the browser would also delete all the user&rsquo;s habits. In the future, we could incorporate a backend server to keep data on our databases so that users can access their habits on any computer.
