                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind the discord bot is to easily help players get noticed by recruiters, and recruiters to easily compare potential recruits and decide who fits their team the most. And its a bot that runs on the discord framework! as most of the gamers use discord and will be willing to use it as they are already familiar with how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes various API's and game servers to retrieve a player's stats and compile valuable stats into one embed message and outputs it on discord.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the discord.js library for the discord api. Then used nodeJS as our back-end scripting language to scrape through servers and API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of problems trying to get important stats compiled into one message as different API's have a different way of returning stats, so it took us a while to figure out how to convert everything into a standard format we could use for the embed message on discord.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of how we implemented the League of Legends API, as it was not properly set up from Riot's end, and also retrieving live game stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about git and how easy it can be to collaborate with teammates.
                </p>
