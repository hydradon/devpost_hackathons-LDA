                    <li>
                        Running the Marketing by themselves &gt;&gt; They are not experts

                        Working with an agency &gt;&gt; For small budgets, the work done is mediocre, generally talking and the fees are high

                    <li>
                        Hiring a Freelancer &gt;&gt; Lots of guesswork, not being sure if a certain expert is the right fit for the business needs.
