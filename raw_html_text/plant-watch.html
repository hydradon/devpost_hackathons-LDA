                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TerraMesa inspired us to create an app to help people keep track of their garden in order to encourage more people to take up the hobby by taking out the hassle of remembering everything. Which in turn promotes sustainability because it helps increase food security and reduce carbon emissions.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our current application is very limited but all the foundation is there and with more time it could've been a fleshed app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never developed an android app so self-teaching was a big factor. We also ran into issues implementing many features that ended up not working but their skeleton is there and with more time we could have easily repaired them.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully laying the ground work for future app development. Found an idea early on and following through with and fleshing it out.

                <p>
                    How to develop Android applications. We also all learned more about sustainability and promoting a better environment.
