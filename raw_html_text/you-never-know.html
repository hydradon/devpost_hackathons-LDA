                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major issue in the world is abuse. It happens all around and people are afraid to speak up because of feelings for their abuser or they are afraid. We wanted to create a game that allowed people to know that they are not the only ones experiencing this and that by uniting together and bringing awareness is the fastest solution possible. We also choose a male main character because people do not acknowledged that sexual abuse also affects men too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a textbased Interactive Visual Novel. The player plays as a 12 year old child who is entering into middle school for the new school year. The other characters he is able to interactive with is his close elementary school friend Sandy, his mean teacher, Mrs. White, and a loving teacher , Mr. Fine. The game progresses with character development and the ability to choose specific actions to change the story. The story will take a dramatic turn to a sexual abuse situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity's 2D IDE to produce this game. We generated objects and imported in images as spirtes to manipulate them into our desired functionality. To generate the characters in the game, we used illustrator to create custom characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major Challenge that we ran into was the developing the story line of the game. The planning process took a very long time and none of us have had any creative writing experience. Using unity was a major challenge as we would need to create multiple scenes in order to progress through the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a finished prototype of an interactive visual novel game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that, there are always challenges that we did not plan in advance. Working together in areas that each of us specialized in, is the best way to accomplish a goal and that team work makes for better work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for You Never Know
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop alternative endings in order to give the player different play routes to choose from. The alternative endings will also give the player a different perspective of issues pertaining to sexual abuse.
