                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing about the Magic Mirror produced in Japan, we wanted to produce an app using AR. After a bad experience in Geneva, we realised it would be useful to view food in a restaurant before ordering to avoid disappointment when your friend's food arrives, and looks much better than yours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans AR codes that will be placed on restaurant menus. It will display an augmented 3D model of the corresponding food item, allowing the customer to view the food before they order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Unity, Vuforia and C#. We attempted to build a UI in Android Studio but found out later it was hard to merge our progress with the completed AR model program we had completed in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few challenges we ran into involved learning how to use Unity, the compatibility problems that occurred when using newer versions of both Unity and Vuforia, trying to use photo-realistic models, and attempting to build the app. We overcame these problems, by downloading legacy versions of both pieces of software, using cartoon images for the demo and having a positive attitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully managed to implement a demo of our idea, 
the app is especially useful when you are in a foreign country and do not speak the country's native language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our team had used Unity before, so we had to start from scratch. We had not used Android Studio properly either so our initial goals to produce this AR app was ambitious. We learnt not to give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARMenu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope to add real 3D models to the database (when we have the technology to do this available), and we hope we can mine social media pages with the appropriate hashtags, to gain even more realistic models of the food, as it seems taking pictures of your food is an ever increasing trend. Finally, we want to add the functionality to view ingredients in the dish, just incase a customer is allergic to an ingredient and doesn't notice allergens mentioned on the menu.
