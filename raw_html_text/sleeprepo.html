                    Inspiration came from my roommate getting annoyed with my deep sleeping habits and my need to wake up at 5 for rowing practices. Also, my annoyance at fellow members of the crew team who struggled to wake up early enough for practice.

                    In the works iOS alarm clock application.
Intended for use but roommates, teammates, and other people who depend on each other to wake up efficiently.
Will have in-app messaging to send alarm challenges. Interfaces with venmo to automatically pay a roommate if one 
fails to complete a challenge within a selected amount of time after the alarm deploys, to verify awakeness.
