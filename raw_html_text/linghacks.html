                    The homework helper helps users solve physics word problems.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the homework helper by breaking up the problem into steps.  The user inputs the problem, such as "a race car accelerates uniformly from 18.5 m/s to 46.1 m/s in 2.47 s".  NLTK finds the numbers in the problem and uses the units to identify the variables.  For example, m/s is velocity, m/s^2 is acceleration, s is time, and m is displacement.  The if statements find the variables that are given and unknown and plug the variables that are given into the equation.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into are there cannot be punctuation after the units, and there might be two outputs if there are two equations that use the same inputs.

                    An accomplishment that I am proud of is using a Python library in my first hackathon project.
