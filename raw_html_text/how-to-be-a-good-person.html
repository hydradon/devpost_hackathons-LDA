                        This was inspired by the notion that sustainability is about building character and be a member of the larger community through informing and interacting with others about the impact one has on a global scale.

                        It's an educational application built for the iPad to teach elementary and middle school students about becoming sustainable individuals. It teaches them habits to reduce their carbon footprint that they will remember as they grow up into sustainable adults who may then teach their children to be more sustainable and eco-friendly.

                    <em>
                        We used Figma to create a prototype of the project for demonstration purposes and later intend to use Xcode and swift to build it.

                    <em>
                        After talking to a few mentors we came to the realization that this game idea we had would be very difficult to implement in a short period of time. Thus we decided that it was more important to get the idea and the user experience across and created a hi-fidelity interactive prototype.
