                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make an app to help people, who have trouble hearing, walk on the streets. Initially this app was only aimed at people with hearing disabilities, but I realised that nearly everyone walking/running on the streets is plugged in. So I decided to change the focus of this app to anyone who is walking on the streets, and is unable to hear the sounds on the street.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would warn the user of any honks,  sirens or fire alarms by detecting these sounds in their surrounding and vibrating their phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build this app I used a cloud database to store sample sounds and used an audio matching sdk to match the sounds in the environment with the ones stored in the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The APII was using was mainly focused on music. The biggest challenge I faced was to train the API to compare the warning sounds in the environment with those in the database. To do this I had to first reduce noise in the incoming audio and then process it through the API. Since the API is mainly for music I had to figure out a way  for it to recognise sudden sounds like honks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finally trained the API by making taking the sounds of the sirens, alarms and honks and repeating all of them till I had audio files long enough to be a length of a song. This is not a very elegant solution but I think it is a clever one. Also sufficient for my prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To understand how to trick the API I had to dig into it to see how it recognized music. This taught me a lot about sound recognition and also made me realised that it is more complicated than it looks. I would love to learn more about this.
                </p>

                    What's next for WarnMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing I want to do is to allow users to record sounds they want to be warned about. I have an idea on how to do this and I will certainly work on this after the hackathon.
