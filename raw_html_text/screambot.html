                    INSPIRATION: common interest in fantasy horror video games and we wanted to recreate the protagonist experience (shoutout for addition inspiration to the broken Costa machine in the lower south junction that won't stop screaming)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    WHAT IT IS: bascially it is a robot that thinks that it is the protagonist of a horror video game. It is a scared of  darkness, loud noises and anything getting in the way of its escape. It will emit stressful noises when encountering something that scares it (which is almost everything)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    HOW: we used the gopigo robots that we built during the TechSoc Hardware sessions, added a vibration sensor (as a path sensor), a light sensor, a sound detector and a buzzer. We wrote a python code that should cause it to roam around screaming for a good part of 3 minutes
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    OUR CHALLENGES: neither of had a very good understanding of scripting. We also encountered multiple hardware malfunctions (batteries died and it took us 6 hours to figure out that was the problem) and generally there was so much external knowledge and googling necessary to understand every single line we wrote
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    WHAT WE ARE PROUD OF: good teamwork despite different backgrounds and skills in different domains of computer science (and one of us not even being from UCL

                <h2>
                    WHAT WE LEARNED: nothing works and the scream bot is actually an accurate representation of what coding feels like

                    THE FUTURE OF SCREAMBOT?: good things, we hope. for now, is shall be put to rest until it is needed again. do not applaud too loud. you WILL scare it.
