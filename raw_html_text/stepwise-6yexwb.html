                <p>
                    How do you inspire action within your community? Petitions never really work, and there seems to be no motivating drive to incentivize attacking issues that are at the core of our society's problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to center our project around the United Nations' 17 sustainable global development initiatives, and allow our users to tackle a project that they are truly passionate about. As the world&rsquo;s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone. To its initial goals of safeguarding peace, protecting human rights, establishing the framework for international justice and promoting economic and social progress, in the seven decades since its creation the United Nations has added on new challenges, such as climate change, refugees and AIDS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While conflict resolution and peacekeeping continue to be among its most visible efforts, the UN, along with its specialized agencies, is also engaged in a wide array of activities to improve people&rsquo;s lives around the world &ndash; from disaster relief, through education and advancement of women, to peaceful uses of atomic energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StepWise addresses this issue by gamifying the experience of a web application that walks users through achieving their service projects, no matter the scale, on a step-by-step basis. Even though StepWise is accessible to users spanning from all demographics, our target audience for this platform is the younger generation (millennials, Gen Z) who feel frustrated by the state of things and are empowered to change the status quo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project integrates awareness, community, and gives students a platform to empower them to continue their goals. Together we can make a positive difference in world-- one step at a time.

                <h1>
                    Further Development
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In continuation with this project, we would like to integrate a point system to allow users to competitively track their goals compared to other members in the StepWise community to drive progress. Growth and further development in our project would mean initiating partnerships with corporate sponsors and nonprofits to fund the incentivization of these initiatives.
