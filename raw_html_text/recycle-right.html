                    Recycling is great for the planet, but is getting more and more confusing for people to decipher what is recyclable and what isn't. According to Santa Barbara County

                    , many new things have lost their ability to be recycled, such as plastic food containers (like yogurt), and paper food containers.

                    Recycle Right takes a picture of your preferred trash, such as a plastic water bottle, and uses machine learning to determine if it is recyclable or not! Simply hold your trash in the outlined area, press the green button, and wait until a green or red light indicates if it is recyclable or not.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a webcam, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino as our main sources of hardware for this project. Software-wise, we used TensorFlow, Arduino's IDE, and Python.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very time consuming to install, uninstall, and reinstall programs and systems into the Raspberry Pi. It was our first time using a Raspberry Pi so it was a steep learning curve, but was a great tool that we can't wait to use in the future.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Monica - I am proud of how much more experience I gained with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
Alysha - I started from the ground up, learning TenserFlow and exploring Machine Learning. Very proud to have installed pip (see meme in WH20's meme-challenge)
Nina - Working with Raspberry Pi for the first time, and brainstorming with my team. We also learned more about Linux.

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about efficiency, operating systems, and machine learning.

                    What's next for Recycle Right
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a great technology that can be easily implemented into parks &amp; open spaces, schools, and other places that many people (and recycles!) gather.
