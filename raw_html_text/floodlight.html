                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a backend with java spring and mongoDB, deployed it on a kubernetes cluster and hosted it on the google cloud platform. The frontend is designed as a smartphone app, built with Flutter from Google and utilizing material design guidlines.
