                    Creating presentations are time-consuming! Why not allow our application to make a presentation for you?

                <p>
                    AutoPresent is a web-based application that is able to create presentations from analyzing one's speech. While one is talking about a certain topic, AutoPresent is hearing closely and is able to determine the main subject. Then, the application is able to detect how to consolidate the text to fit it neatly into a presentation format.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of different front-end and back-end programming languages in order to develop our app. Our back-end server runs on both Flask and PHP and our front-end scripts run on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout TJ Hacks, we encountered issues using the IBM Watson APIs, as the requests often overlay each other.
