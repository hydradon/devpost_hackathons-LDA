                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to see who haven't followed me back / unfollowed me on Instagram but there was no easy way to do this. As a result, we built this.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compares the list of people you follow to the list of people that follow you on Instagram and presents the people that don't follow you back easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We utilized Python to build this project, using GitHub to easily collaborate.

                    We can do a lot in a short amount of time with proper focus. Also, we became very familiar with utilizing Selenium for web scraping.
