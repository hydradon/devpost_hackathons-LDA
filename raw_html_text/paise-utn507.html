                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I share my apartment with my classmate. We usually pay our bills and share the expenses. I wanted a decentralized solution that would help monitor my expense without sending it to a centralized server.
                </p>

                    It's a personal expense manager to monitor and get insight into your daily spends

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Blockstack to create the dApp which give the data in the hands of the user.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the Blockstack is frontend on the challenge is to share data between multiple users and keep the data private at the same time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to develop cryptography powered app for managing expenses.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about cryptography and why giving the data in the hands of the user is important.
                </p>

                </h2>

                    I would like to add Split Expense feature to share expenses like food, bills, etc with friends and pay them using Lighting
