                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the current measles resurgence in Washington State, it is important that we recognize the trends of vaccines adherence and exemption within schools. Largely influenced by this and the all-important herd immunity, it is vital that government officials and those at CDC are aware of areas with vulnerable populations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mapped the data we collected so that trends in vaccination exemption could easily be visualized through multiple perspectives.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first found a collection to data with gave us information about vaccine adherence and exemption. The Californian information was especially insightful as it gave data about specific illnesses as well. We the used Google Maps API to find the longitude and latitude of each school's location which then be transferred, along with the remainder of the data, to Omni Sci. We used Omni Sci, an incredibly effective analytics platform, to translate and create visual representations in order to discern potential trends.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was in finding data which was not only reliable and representative, but also had the same data available over a large time period. This proved to be difficult as vaccine data is not published on a national level and often as well on the state level. Furthermore, data that we found was often messy and required additional formatting on our part.  A challenge we later ran into was the time constraint Google Cloud Platform's map API placed upon the amount of data we were able to collect and process.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the vast amount of data we were able to collect, as well as learning new skills through the process of learning how to create this project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Omni Sci's program to make display data in different forms, and how to format data that is not always clean to be used within the process. We also learned how to use Google Cloud Platform's maps API to find longitude and latitude of given locations within the data set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Californian Vaccine Exemptions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to take the time to process and include California's vaccine data over a larger period of time as they provide data from 2000 to present. Furthermore, being able to do the same for other states and creating a national system would be incredibly insightful in preventing the outbreak of treatable illnesses.
