                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use Amazon's Alexa to demonstrate how wolfram alpha's API could be used in a simple, real world setting and decided to use the 'rhyming words' feature to create short raps about a given word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When given a word, the Amazon Echo gets a list of rhymes from Wolfram Alpha and answers with a few short rap verses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon's Lambda serverless architecture to create a custom node.js server to run when contacted by the Echo. The node server then contacts Wolfram Alpha using their API, parses the response it receives and transforms it into a short rap, then sends this data back to the Echo to be spoken aloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We had difficulty setting up the AWS Lambda but were helped by a fellow hacker. We also hoped to have a custom web server running alongside the AWS Lambda, but it would have taken too long.

                        We demo'ed MC Alexa on stage at HackPoly during the night's freestyle battle with great success.

                        This was our team's first hackathon ever, and as first year students we're happy to have finished a product in the end
