                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, there have been a few women marches, and their purpose is to show their support of women's rights. They wear pink hats to show their support
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app snap a picture of a person, and edit the picture by inserting one of the three pink hat options. After user is done editing, he/she can share it on social media to spread their picture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to code the iOS app, and Sketch to design the GUI and the icon image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not share the new picture. The share button has to share both the picture taken and the hat that the user edits together. We could not figure out how to share both pictures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The easily-accessible GUI, and figuring out the program to link the share button
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use iOS UI image view.

                    What's next for PinkSnap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more variety of hats, and input ads in our app. We will also be submitting updated version the app on the App Store.
