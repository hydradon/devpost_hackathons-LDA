                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in 3D printers and want to incorporate them somehow. We also love cooking and pancakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can take any vector file and make it into exact pancake art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gutted an old 3D printer and added a condiment container to hold the pancake batter. The batter is extruded with a 12V vacuum pump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solid state relay we had did not support DC voltage switching. Inconsistent pressure with our batter extruder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a pancake in the design of the WWH logo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emma and Cassidy - We learned how different majors can come together. Erica - How 3D printers work. Zach - How to efficiently turn vector artwork to CAM to gcode. We all learned how to make pancakes.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pancake 2000
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get a proper DC relay to switch on the vacuum pump. Also, automatic flipping of the pancake.
