                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After playing basketball for 10 year I realized that it is quite hard to develop game sense when playing on the court because it is hard to see how your actions may affect the rest of the play when you are off the ball. Some actions that seem meaningless actually help open up the court for the rest of your team. I wanted to create a game that can be a fun and interactive way to develop this game sense in newer basketball players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a point and click basketball game where you can use the F1 to F3 keys to select your players and then use a left mouse click to move them. Passing can be done through the use of the 1-3 keys by choosing the number of the player you want to pass to. If the number pressed is the number of the player currently in possession of the ball it will result in a shot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I searched online for what was good for game development and it told me that Unity was one of the best platforms for games. I then used the default game objects in unity to create the playing field, sourcing online for additional assets when they were insufficient. After that I added in the script for movement through point and click. Finally I added the scripts for passing, shooting then dribbling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used Unity before this hackathon so I had to do a lot of self learning throughout these 24 hours. Even though picking up C# language was not too hard due to my familiarity with other languages, the physics aspect of the 3D game design was entirely new to me and took a lot of trial and error to figure out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm quite happy I did not give up when I was struggling at the start and barely able to even get the playing field set up. I was tempted to switch to doing an Android app because I have prior experience in Java but I am glad I decided to stick with learning a new programming skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a bit about game development and the physics of movement. Trying to get the right bounciness of the ball and backboard and floor and also figuring out how to get the ball to arc when shooting was an educational experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BasketballGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What is currently done is very basic. I am planning to add multiplayer functionality. This would consist of scripts that account for the defense when taking into account the success of a shot or a pass. I would also like to add specific player stats that will affect the gameplay such as passing accuracy, speed, shooting accuracy, height etc.
