                </h2>
                <p>
                    LAMP stack, Adobe XD

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our group members are at the beginner level, and we did not have a teammate who was able to contribute any front end development. It was difficult to put together a functional solution without the client-side.
