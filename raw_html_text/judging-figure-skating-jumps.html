                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by Alena Kostornaia's performance at the IDF 2019. I wanted to educate the viewers on how Figure Skating jumps and programs are judged.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that informs the user.

                    I built it using the Technica-Starter-App from Visionist.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I wanted to add forms but I did not figure out how too.

                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to create a website. I also created the gifs myself.
