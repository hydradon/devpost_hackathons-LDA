                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to make the Wellesley campus more accessible and give students a better sense of agency in finding their homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using github to collaborate, we built the pages with HTML/CSS after doing some field research (when we took all the photos). The back end is done in python using a jinja environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled a few times to figure out the best and most efficient way to display our date. We wanted to balance information and UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy we could finish our project! We really like that this is a very clear beginning with a lot of work that can be done (with our projects as guidelines) to make information more easily available to students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to becoming more confident in our hacking abilities, we all learned a lot about accessibility. Noticing things across campus really made us more aware of how difficult it can be to navigate a campus like Wellesley.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wellesley Blue Prints
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to continue growing the project to catalogue as many aspects of accessibility on campus as possible, including creating a board position for accessibility so someone is able to answer more questions and do more research.
