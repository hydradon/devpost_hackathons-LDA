                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first hackathon, we were confused as to what products to take to develop a project. Hence, we have made two A.R. games that link us to a website that helps us decide what to choose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a fun game that links us to a website that helps us decide the best product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity and c# commands for the game and html and  css languages for website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was definitely a factor, and hence it was difficult for us to come with a source code that could be used for helping user decide what to choose.
                </p>
