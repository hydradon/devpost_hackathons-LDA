                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    Older vehicles lack any sort of comprehensive display for vehicle diagnostics and fuel economy information, solving this is both a personal advantage and an environmental one. OBDEfficient is a cheap hardware setup and program that reads and presents vehicle diagnostic information in addition to calculating the most fuel efficient speed to drive at based on user data. An OBD2 adapter through Bluetooth or USB connection transfers raw vehicle diagnostics to a Raspberry Pi 3 to be interpreted by our python based program. Challenges in correctly transferring raw data as well as in implementing the GUI taught us both more about hardware configuration and GUI creation. Much more diagnostic information could be added to the interface in the future and interpreted as is most useful.
