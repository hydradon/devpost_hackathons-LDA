                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always had niche one-time use ingredients and herbs that I didn't know what to do with, so I decided to build a tool that would help me find other ingredients that would go well with it, as well as a recipe to tie it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes one ingredient as input, returns as many other ingredients as needed, and downloads a video of a recipe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote a script in python with he assistance of 2 large databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Databases were so large that run time became an issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing it! Being able to download appropriate videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard work and perseverance pays off.

                    What's next for Recipe Finder

                <p>
                    Better GUI and a more robust recipe library.
