                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love food and wanted to try harnessing the power of Google Cloud Vision to discover new restaurants
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    foodRecc takes photos from a user's Twitter feed and recommends restaurants based on photos of food
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built foodRecc using Google Cloud Vision, Twitter, and Zomato APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to get photos from Instagram accounts, however Instagram recently changed their cryptography and made it more difficult to scrape photos
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing this project, using 3 APIs simultaneously together in a smooth manner in the span of 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a good development environment and installing Python dependencies can be difficult at times. Instagram is not very developer friendly and actively makes it difficult to scrape images from their platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for foodRecc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all seriousness, we would like to get Instagram integration and improve the recommendation system to be less naive
                </p>
