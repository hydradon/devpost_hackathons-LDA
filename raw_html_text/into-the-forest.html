                    We realized that many people, particularly younger people, were not aware of the effects of climate change. However, lots of children enjoy playing video games. So we thought of combining the two to make a video game that was both fun and education.
There were a lot of challenges. First of all, it was all of our first hackathons, so we were quite unprepared for the intensity and fast-paced work environment. We were also excited to learn new things and wanted to balance time between our project and other workshops we were interested in.
In addition, all of us did not have much experience in coding. The person who was the main coder had only one year of python coding before the Hackathon, and the others never took a proper course in coding.
Instead, we found use for our other abilities. One of our team members was an avid artist, and she did the animation for all of our scenes. Another one was interested in music producing and made the soundtrack for our game.
In the end, we struggled to meet the deadline and produce a PC game that satisfied our high expectations of being both computationally and artistically complex. Nonetheless, we continued to improve our teamwork and persevered.
