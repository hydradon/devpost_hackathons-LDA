                    The Transparency Project facilitates the understanding of our political process through interactive data visualization. By aggregating data from social media platforms, search engines, and ad markets, we equip voters with the ability to make a more informed decisions in the upcoming presidential election.

                <p>
                    For our initial idea, we wanted to make our website an exploration of the Facebook Ad Library, a repository available to researchers that contains information about all the ads run on facebook from as early as 2018. 
However, we realized on Friday afternoon that in order to access the API, Facebook required a conformation code sent via
                    <em>
                        snail mail
                    </em>
                    . As reported in many other outlets, their Ad Library seems to be written to comply with Congressional demands without actually facilitating research on how political ads operate on Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this inspired us to look at advertisement and visibility of 2020 presidential candidates using a more varied set of data, including Google Trends, Google&rsquo;s Transparency report, a public subset of the Facebook Ad Library, Instagram, and Twitter.

                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about web development, as well as creating interactive dashboard through Plotly/Dash.
We discovered the complexities (and limitations) of how Dash dashboards can be customized in CSS to fit a larger design.

                        We would like to automate data scraping further using BeautifulSoup, so that our website could keep its data up to date for the entire 2020 cycle. Furthermore, once we gain authorized access to the Facebook Ad Archive API, we could collect much more data and fullfill the original vision.
