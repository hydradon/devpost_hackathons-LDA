                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to tie together our common childhood hobbies by producing something resembling a game we enjoyed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The setup consists of two drums and one foot pedal (to imitate the bass drum). Using three different coloured LEDs, Drum Master indicates the drum the player should hit. It also displays the subsequent three drums (using three more LEDs of each colour) to inform the player of which drums come next in the sequence. A screen displays the count of the number of drums that are hit correctly and within the acceptable time frame. The game ends after four minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wood for the frame, drums, and pedal. Using springs, we elevated the drum and pedal surfaces slightly above the force sensor so that the sensor can detect the impact as the player hits the drum. We used foam pieces to reduce the sound of wood collisions as the drum is hit. We used one breadboard and arduino to connect the lights and another breadboard to connect the score-keeping screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging the arduino program was a challenge.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a stable, portable, and aesthetically pleasing drum set which imitates components of a real drum kit. We are also proud of our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about using many power tools and gained a lot of experience with these tools. We also gained more experience using arduinos and learned to incorporate two arduinos in our design.
                </p>

                    What's next for Drum Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add improvements such as multiple difficulty levels and more drums.
