                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing stringed instruments has been an enriching experience in the formative years of my young adulthood. Unfortunately, I've never been able to tune a guitar properly and have found that using a frequency checking device over encumbering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The double discrete one dimensional Fourier transform inverse provides a robust method of finding the first harmonic given noisy and imperfect acoustic data. With a custom designed control algorithm, this device can tune any stringed device that is tuned via rotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The proof of concept model was built with lumber and hardware purchasable at Home Depot (see challenges). The Arduino was the only non off-the-shelf item used. A breadboard made adaptable wiring simple since a drill motor from Harbor Freight was used to provide the torque for the system. A single degree of freedom threaded rod was rotated. A wood nut insert traversed aforementioned rod to adjust tension in guitar cord, following Hooke's law relationship between tension and displacement.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fruition of project didn't occur until roughly 5 P.M. Saturday when our current project for automated email to/cc/bcc list generator due to email processing time (large datasets).
Develop a cutting edge system which uses the inverse time from the Fourier transform of a Fourier transform on the system. Excess noise prohibited traditional Fourier analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to achieve similar results of high tech tuning devices with a laptop microphone. Project idealization, creation, and testing was accomplished within the given time limit.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to succeed is to have a strong team effort, creativity, and good work delegation.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Feedback Control Stringed Instrument Tuner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for the Feedback Control Stringed Instrument Tuner is to convert the current system into a design which is standalone and features a motor which is handheld so that the user can utilize the tuner on their various stringed musical equipment.
