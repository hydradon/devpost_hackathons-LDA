                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The event ticket system for Bitcoin Wednesday sucks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it super easy to buy tickets for events with Bitcoin, and easy to verify at the door that a ticket is valid and paid, without requiring trust in a third party.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a webapp that allows users to buy tickets, and even hosts to validate these tickets at event checkin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever a user wants to pay for a ticket. we generate a new address for that order. We have a Bitcoin Cash node that tracks payments to that address, and once it is paid, we send the user a token they can use to show at the event to prove his payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The host can use the app to scan the user's token during event checkin, and validate that the payment has been made and the ticket is valid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only had limited developers and time to build the app, with no preparation or previous experience developing with BCH. The app itself has quite a few features and components, including things we have never done before such as scanning and generating QR codes, so getting everything ready within the limited time was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventCash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop the app into a service that event hosts can use to sell tickets for events with cryptocurrencies. We want to accept a wide range of currencies, and add features such as price stability (in fiat denominations), more complex orders, and more options for event hosts to configure ticket options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At least get Bitcoin Wednesday to use this solution so we can pay for tickets without problems. :)
