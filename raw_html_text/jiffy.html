                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I Got the inspiration for Jiffy by thinking of discord bots and we though it would be cool to make a bot for slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the hackathon schedule and suggests what meals you should eat from plated.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jiffy was built with Javascript and node.js also with botkit to interface with the slack API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a big challenge where for some reason jiffy was not replying to messages it was programmed for.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about data structures, functions, third party API's and how to pair program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned as beginners to program in JavaScript and Node.js.

                    What's next for Jiffy
                </h2>
