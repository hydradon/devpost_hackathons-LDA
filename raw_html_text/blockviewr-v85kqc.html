                    A lot of engineering students' interests in design and inventing started with Legos. Given the oppurtunity to work with an Oculus Rift, we looked to take our inspiration to the next level. Allowing users to to skip the convention of building Legos from a set of instructions and fulfill their life long dreams of being a Lego Developer, BlockViewR's complete immersion encapsulates all aspects of the process, from designing to outputting instructions to build the finished product. Users can design their Lego set with a variety of blocks and actual Lego colors then automatically receive pictures of each level of the set as well as a materials list.
We first designed the blocks in AutoDesk's Inventor, then exported them to Unity where we designed and built the rest of the program. Github allowed multiple members of our team to work on different aspects of the project at the same time, disseminating our progress and actual lines of code in real time.
While designing the user-interface, we often gravitated towards 2D pictures and "concepts", but re-evaluated what each part of the program visually looked like to maximize the capabilities of the Rift. The combination of the time limit and being freshman CS majors with have basic self taught knowledge of coding in Unity for 3D games, we wanted to achieve and integrate a lot more into the interface, but was limited. Understanding that user interaction with the program extends well beyond what they see, we attempted to integrate controller free command of the blocks. We look to tackle this challenge soon in order to progress the experience. 
Within the actual program, we were able to successfully mimic interaction with the blocks as if objects in real life. Minimizing artificial and stereotypical computer-like communication between the user and objects by zooming in and out based on where you are looking rather then fixed points as well as allowing free movement in the 3D space heighten the immersive contact. While we look to overcome the real life anchor that is the XBox controller, we mapped the buttons functions to be as familiar as possible to normal gaming conventions. 
Overall, working in the hackathon environment was extremely rewarding and enjoyable. The time limit pushed us to complete as much as possible as soon as possible and help from mentors and other groups supported us. Designing and building a program to be used by real people showed us how many things must be taken into account. This new perspective allowed us to build an interface that encompassed both a developer's and user's desires.
