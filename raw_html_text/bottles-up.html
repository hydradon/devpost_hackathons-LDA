                    A lot of plastic waste is due to improper disposal. Many companies are already upcycling plastics into innovative products, but they are challenged by a lack of clean and properly segregated plastic bottles. This issue is especially prevalent in Singapore where people are not motivated to recycle plastic bottles and dispose of them as regular waste.

                    We propose an online marketplace where fashion-conscious consumers are able to browse environmentally-friendly products from popular brands such as Adidas and Patagonia. Consumers are able to obtain discounts and vouchers on these items by exchanging clean plastic bottles for credits at a machine located in their neighborhood. The collected plastic bottles would then be forwarded to the companies to be upcycled.
