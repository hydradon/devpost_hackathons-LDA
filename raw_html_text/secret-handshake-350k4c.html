                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy a good old-fashioned hack that repurposes existing technology in an interesting way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Secret Handshake allows users to upload images and text via our web app to our secure server, which uses OTP encryption to post their hashed files on a designated subreddit for storage until needed. Each file is identified by a unique key provided by the user, so users can access their files anywhere and from any device with internet connection as long as they remember their key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Go for server-side code and JavaScript for client-side, with React to design the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically had to learn network code for this project, so that was pretty challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned network code! And Go! And finished a complete platform in under 36 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basically everything about building a full-stack web app in Go and JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Secret Handshake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to implement a variety of file types so that Secret Handshake could actually become a feasible storage solution, capable of storing virtually any data the user wants stashed somewhere for safe keeping.
