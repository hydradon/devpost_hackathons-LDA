                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for ways to get kids active, when I thought about bringing the compelling concepts in video games (upgrades, scoreboards, etc) to physical games outside. A laser tag game using a connected app would help kids get back outside while still enjoying their favorite first person shooter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lasorzzz brings laser tag into the 21st century.  Using an app enabled smartphone docked on the laser tag controller players can launch games, keep score, upgrade their weapons, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a Photon microcontroller to control and communicate from the laser tag gun to the smartphone. The smartphone app displays player related information including health, ammunition, and weapon selection.

                <p>
                    I learned how to communicate between different wireless devices and integrate those devices and sensors into a single device.
