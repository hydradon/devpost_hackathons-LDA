                <p>
                    Main goal is to shorten the time between asking the question and getting the right answer as much as possible, theoretically to zero.

                    Good answers are given a "Validated" topic by community in yammer. Looking for the answer in Yammer itself may be over-helming for some users who are not so much into social or technology. 
For this people and for this purposes, google-like page is provided, where people can start asking the question and only Validated answers would come up. If there are no results at all or nothing that can help, button changes to ASK and your question is submitted back to Yammer
