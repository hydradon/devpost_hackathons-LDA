                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    735,000 Americans suffer from heart attacks each year and thousands more suffer from heart disease.  It is important for Americans and people around the world to be aware of the dangers of heart disease and how they can keep their heart healthy. By providing advice and tips to keep your heart in tip top shape, as well as an accurate heart health tracking system, people around the world will become better aware of the situation and more willing to keep themselves healthy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website contains educational information about heart attacks and preventative measures. Combining multimedia content, it teaches users how to estimate their maximum heart rate and ways to stay healthy. Additionally, it includes an incentive system such that each user who enters hours in the accompanying app will be entered into a weekly raffle for gift cards.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website in HTML/CSS in TextWrangler, an enhanced text editor. We started with an index.html page and gradually added additional pages. After fixing content on each page, we added CSS styling to match a central theme. Finally, we revamped the color scheme and fixed minor formatting things (margins, alignment, overlay).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simultaneously, we worked on an app in Android Studio that would allow users to create their own account and add entries of their past exercise (day to day). If they successfully logged at least 2 hours of exercise over consecutive days, the app would display encouraging messages and incentivize the user to continue protecting their heart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all new to Android Studio so there was a steep learning curve before we could actually start programming. As a result, the already-pressing time crunch became even more of an issue over the weekend. Furthermore, we had difficulty connecting to an actual Android phone and feeding the data to the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, our original plan was to utilize the google fit API to develop an application that reads a person&rsquo;s heartbeat and then sends emergency text messages and calls to 911 if the person&rsquo;s heartbeat exceeded or went below a certain threshold. However, we had difficulty reading the heartbeat from android watch and transferring data from the watch; ultimately, due to time constraints, we were not able to fully complete the application in time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team only met a few months ago so this is our first time working on a project together. As high schoolers, we are proud to be able to present a finished product at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, we learned tons of new styling techniques to create the navigation bar, slideshow (home page), and colorful forms. Even though we all had some basic HTML/CSS background prior to PennApps, this project greatly expanded our understanding. We&rsquo;re proud of completing the website in the final night, after many challenges along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned valuable version control skills through Github. Furthermore, we explored the basics of Android Studio and how we could read and write data to a database. Despite all knowing basic HTML/CSS, designing the website tested this knowledge (especially the CSS), and we expanded our knowledge base in both languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Heart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to being able to track health information from the phone, we want to expand My Heart to Fitbits, Apple Watches, and other wrist devices. By doing so, we will gain continuous access to a person&rsquo;s heart rate, thus being able to tell whether they have a heart attack. In the case of this emergency, notifications will be sent immediately to emergency contacts and first responders, increasing the chances of recovery and survival. We also hope to get more sponsors so that there is a wider variety of possible weekly rewards for users. We unfortunately could not finish the app, but the future involves completing the UI and integrating user data between the app and website.
