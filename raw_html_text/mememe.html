                <p>
                    Life really is all about you. You can finally prove that to others with this hack. Use this chrome extension to change any Wikipedia page to be about you instead of whatever inferior topic it previously had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by wanting to have a silly, simple hack.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It replaces every mention of the Wikipedia topic in the page with your name instead. You're more important. It also inserts new images.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    I wanted to use an api to get pictures but I didn't have time to figure out how to get around the specific security restrictions that chrome extensions have that make it different from tutorials for a website.
