                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Renewable solar energy is the fastest growing energy source in the world.  Roof top installations bring the responsibility for electricity generation to an individual building manager.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Alexa skill allows a user to query the status of their solar installation.  If the efficiency has dropped to a certain point, they can turn on the sprinklers to clean the panels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our skill uses a lambda that queries a DynamoDB database for the efficiency values of different solar grid sectors.  We can invoke a sprinkler intent on a sector that increases the efficiency of that sector.  Since manually editing values in a database to reset the demo is very boring, we have a sandstorm intent that decreases the efficiency of a sector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one day hackathons, data is always an issue.  Ideally we would have a stream of instantaneous readings from a solar installation that we would aggregate to get efficiency values.  Instead, we had to bypass that and add efficiency values directly to the data base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an Alexa skill with three intents and multiple slots, including one custom slot for the grid names.  It reads and writes state in a DynamoDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Solar Status
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having more realistic data in the form of Kinesis streams from which we could generate aggregate values would be valuable.
