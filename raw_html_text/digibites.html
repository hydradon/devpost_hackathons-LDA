                    We are enhancing the local food ecosystem with a software application that allows food creators to quickly, easily, and profitably donate food to those who need it. We will allow food donors to affordably order transportation for their excess food and unlock powerful unused tax incentives for their business that increases their bottom line. We will establish a supply chain between charitable food providers in San Diego  and high quality food donors like catering agencies, restaurants, and farmer's markets at no cost. All this will come together to realize our ultimate goal of creating a city where unnecessary food waste is prevented and nobody ever misses a meal.

                    We spent a long time trying to understand the food waste landscape here in San Diego, as well as nationally. We found that an immense amount of food is wasted every year. At a minimum, 133 Million pounds, or the equivalent of  $25 Billion dollars, of perfectly edible food is thrown away every year. The restaurants and other food creators here in San Diego can have up to 100 pounds of excess food waste every week.

                    We are currently working towards a Minimum Viable Experience and in turn a Minimum Viable Product. We hope to have our first partners by the time we pitch in June. We will update this bio with a link to our github repo shortly.

                    Our app will help fight the ongoing struggle of food insecurity. When we started working on this project, we found that there is not a need for another food creator. Food insecurity is not a supply issue, there is more than enough food to go around, but rather a transportation issue. We saw the blue ocean market for food waste recovery to be the perfect solution. We see this as a great opportunity to partner with the city and deliver a modern solution to an age old problem. We would love to see where the future takes us.
