                    Concept: Enter Buzzfeed offices and fend off one of the most viral mascots of the internet: Nyan Cat
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Project Challenges: Our original concept was to create a constellation of Buzzfeed articles, grouped by tags and relevancy, however, the primary challenge of pulling and parsing Buzzfeed links and integrating them into the Oculus hardware was unmanageable. The libraries in unity and oculus were quite restrictive for working with other web APIs; creating work-arounds would have taken too long for our team to handle. Despite the setbacks, we decided to take the framework we had created already and create a light-hearted interactive game that uses Buzzfeed's environment to our advantage. To integrate the power of virtual reality in a 3D environment required a lot more math than anticipated.
