                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stress is part of our everyday lives. If stress is not managed properly it can negatively affect our mental and physical health. We know it&rsquo;s not easy to get rid of stress so we created a tool for people to lower stress through the power of simple conversation. Our vision is to provide a better way for users to deal with stress so that they can live a healthy and productive lifestyle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CheerMeUp is your virtual stress manager in a form of a google smart home app. Our tool uses google home to help users cope with stress through conversation with recommendation to help lower stress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to set up our project environment. Our Google smart home app was created using dialogflow on GCP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team was new to Google Cloud Platform. We had some difficulties connecting to NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely  proud of learning a new technology and completing a functioning home app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we learned how to work with GCP, specifically intents and entities in Dialogflow. We also learned how to use dialog to design conversations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CheerMeUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we are looking forward to implementing Natural Learning Understanding (NLU) to be able to process a wide range of responses from the user.
