                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realised that most drivers cannot find the nearest carpark, while reaching their destination. This becomes a hassle as the driver has to go around in circles just to manually look for a carpark.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a easy to use telegram chatbot that uses the driver's current location and periodically finds a path to the nearest chatbot when it is turned on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the smartnation's carpark api to retrieve the available parking lots and filter carparks with at least 5 lots available. Then the coordinates of the nearest carpark and the user's current location are used to develop a path that can be view on an online map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't get the user's coordinate information through the telegram api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We manage to clean and process the smartnation carpark availability api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParkingBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will fix the bugs regarding user location and upload it to Heroku where it can run on the cloud. As such, users can use chatbot to find the nearest carpark with available lots.
