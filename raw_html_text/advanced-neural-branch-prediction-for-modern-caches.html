                    Inspiration - We are computer architecture students trying to program a feasible (resource-wise) branch prediction and targeting maximum accuracy... which is of utmost importance given the current deep pipelines in modern processors
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It predicts whether a branch (decisional code snippet) will be picked up by the hardware or not. This, in turn, allows the processor to proceed with speculative execution of branches and future instructions
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - For our branch prediction algorithm we use a scaled neural branch predictor, which is a scaled perceptron. For updation of the threshold of confidence in the accuracy of the prediction, we use a o-GEHL type dynamic threshold updation. We use a hash function to effective eliminate aliasing among branch path while mapping the branch addresses to the weights.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - To find the right hash function which is crucial in reducing the MPKI(Mispredictions per Kilo Instruction - the standard measure). Also various empirical values required lot of research and data training.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Our MPKI has reached 2.3 with the industrial SPEC 2000 benchmarks. And we did this with really low hardware requirements.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - There are 3 elementary parts to branch predictions:
