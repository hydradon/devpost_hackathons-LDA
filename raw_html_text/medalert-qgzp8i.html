                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A helpful way to remind the elderly such as my grandfather. To take the medicine they need on a daily basis.

                <p>
                    Aaron and I created a virtual assistant to the elderly to remind them to take their daily medications. The way MedAlert works is simple. They log onto our website and add the times they want to be reminded and we will send them a text message 10 minutes before using Twilio&rsquo;s messaging services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MedAlert also works as a day planner with the two clocks being filled with a pie chart in the center as you add more events to it. Now after a busy day you can reflect on how you spent your day.

Above is the git repository. Assuming you are on a Mac or Linux device, in the terminal clone it onto your device and cd into the project directory. 
$ python3 -m venv ~/venv
$ . ~/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Placing a pie chart onto a working clock and then dynamically filling it up with events as they are created.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we able to create not just one but two specialized clocks to hold events in. The one on the left is for AM events and the one on the right is for PM events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with graphs and data. It took multiple JavaScript objects and libraries in order to create the result we were hoping for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only the active clock will tick, so when it's morning only the AM clocks moves then at noon it stops and the PM clock moves. We would also have only the current clock highlight to increase visibility to events for that part of the day.
