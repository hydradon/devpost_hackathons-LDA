                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came from
                    <a href="https://www.rappad.co/" rel="nofollow">
                        RapPad
                    </a>
                    , which is a very similar web app, but suffers from a severe lack of Vim (our Vim keybindings are necessary to

                    </a>
                    !) We learned that RapPad uses the
                    <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" rel="nofollow">
                        Datamuse API
                    </a>
                    , so we proceeded to write a wrapper for it.

                    <code>
                        rhymer
                    </code>
                    will suggest rhymes and count syllables in the Vim text editor.

                    <code>
                        rhymer
                    </code>
                    is written in Vimscript and Python. It uses NLTK and Datamuse for counting syllables and generating rhymes, respectively.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ironically, rhyming was the easy part. The
                    <code>
                        requests
                    </code>
                    Python library makes API calls simple. The difficult part was presenting a menu of rhymes and inserting the user's choice using native Vimscript.

                <p>
                    Getting
                    <code>
                        rhymer

                    </a>
                    was a huge morale boost.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tricky language (Vimscript). Thankfully, it makes an even trickier language (English) a little bit easier.

                    What's next for
                    <code>
                        rhymer
                    </code>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to allow for alternative rhyming schemes. After that, we want to display the syllable counts for each line in the "gutter" in place of line numbers.
