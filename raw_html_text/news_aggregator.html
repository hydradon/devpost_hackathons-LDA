                    NewsMap started out to me as something of a reaction to the 2016 election. I wanted to build a service that would keep track of the things that were actually happening in the world, independent of  the news cycle where things would be sensationalized and promptly forgotten about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the short term I wanted to have a visual representation of the ongoing issues in the world, and kind of make a heat map for where people should move their attention towards. I thought it would help people get an idea of what the real problems are versus what is just another entertainment news story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the long term, I was hoping that it would become something of a social network for political activism. I liked the idea of integrating it with twitter, because of how quickly people can organize on it, and its interactiveness. If there was enough news about an area, and people could see it, it would give people a reason to get together to either celebrate it, or protest.
