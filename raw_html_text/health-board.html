                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For quite a while this year I suffered from an obscure condition. I knew no one that knew anything about this condition so I felt pretty overwhelmed and alone when dealing with it. There are so many social networks around so I was surprised that there wasn't one to connect people that suffer from the same ailments. So I decided to create Health Board with my friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health board connects people that suffer from any common condition. Users can log on and find their condition which then brings them to a forum-style board as well as a live chat with the other members of that community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Materialize on the front end to stylize all of our pages. On the backend, we used Python with Flask, and stored our data in a Mongo database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to stylize the front end was a big difficulty because ease of use, and creating a good environment was really important to us. Also, the design of our user data was not easy because all the components involved in the back-end which included chat messages, forum posts, and user profiles.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making an easy to use a site that would actually help people's lives. We made this because of real events that happened in a group members life, so it was important to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a fully functional web app with a lot of different kinds of data. We also learned a lot about front-end UI and about putting ourselves in the user's shoes.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to get it production ready and actually host it so the world can visit it.
