                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often what&rsquo;s perpetuated within the undocumented community is a fear of having our family members separated. Too often documentation like a birth certificate, medical records, green card, or other type of identification documents are required. This information isn&rsquo;t always accessible, and when it is, it&rsquo;s hidden in the house, the family member most likely will not be in a state of mine to express where to find the information needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where we come in. A Family Preparedness Checklist plan already exist, but we&rsquo;re bring it into the 21st century. We are providing a electronic storage place for this important documentation and immidate access to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide storage and immediate access of private documentation to undocumented immigrants that are on the verge of being deported.  Once their documents are uploaded, trusted individuals such as family members or attorney can have immediate access to the documentation through a security code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using bootstrap, google drive as storage, and google drive as viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we ran into is guarantee of security. That the government will not have access to our users documentation. This is a hard problem to solve but in the future blockbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product, our team, getting a working demo, and the research we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest things we gained from this hackathon is a greater depth of information on immigration policies and procedures within the United States. From ICE to DHS, we become much more educated on the current state of immigration and more specifically resources available today.

                    TOOLS:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some tools we learned were - Adobe XD, HTML, Bootstrap, Visual Studios, Google Drive.
                </p>

                    What's next for ImmiSaver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some new technologies we'd like to implement for website would be mobile integration for easier upload of scanned documents via camera phone, and a voice-to-text feature for easier labeling.
