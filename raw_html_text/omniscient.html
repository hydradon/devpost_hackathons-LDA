                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone extremely interested in the stock market, I started learning about the power of moving averages, recently. However, finding such graphs for the stock wanted, with the moving averages wanted is extremely hard to find. I also wanted a computer to do some of the number crunching that goes into analyzing stocks because I want to be lazy and spend less time on number crunching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has multiple uses. One can view graphs of the volume, moving averages, or both at the same time of their stock of choice sold over a time period they can choose. This allows for a visual display of the stocks trends which is extremely useful for analysis. Furthermore, the program checks for trends within the stock's moving analysis as well as whole stock market, to see if it is a good time to buy or sell the stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first followed a basic tutorial on creating graphs using python and a separate tutorial on getting stock data. Then, I figured out how to put these together in order to create a program that can take this data and visualize or analyze it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble with importing and downloading all the libraries and prerequisites to starting the actual scripting process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the analysis that the program has of stocks, as this analysis was the result of hours of research and understanding, as well as converting this understanding to something a computer can utilize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about data science, specifically in data visualization. I attempted to create a machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices as well, so I learned to difficulties behind machine learning. Lastly, I learned that the first idea is not always the best idea, as I switched my ideas earlier in the hackathon and started this project instead of my previous one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Omniscient
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will attempt to have more in-depth analysis that can better predict if one should by or sell a stock. I want to integrate the concept of long-term investments by calculating P/E ratios and capital returns. Lastly, I want to integrate a machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices.
