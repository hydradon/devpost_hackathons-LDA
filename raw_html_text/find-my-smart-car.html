                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After finding multiple articles of people losing their cars for months and frustrating personal experiences of forgetting where we parked our cars, we decided to create a solution with cars that are able to send their locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After logging in through the Smartcar client portal and registering your vehicle, you are then able to use our application to locate your car with instant directions from Google maps. A visual and description (from computer vision) of your car's surrounding is also provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting with the Smartcar api and the server it provides, we implemented info from there onto a fresh web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Retrieving data from the car and making sure Google streetview works with any arbitrary location.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
