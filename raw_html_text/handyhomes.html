                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were shocked by the recent fires in Australia. We thought about all the people who have been displaced due to evacuation. Our team thought it would be a good idea for Aussies to help Aussies by volunteering a residence for the displaced to stay at. This way, many Australians can have a roof over their head as they get back on their feet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to post or find open residences or shelters. Users can see these places on the map and have the ability to contact posters. Posters have an easy page to manage their shelters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team employed Swift and Xcode to develop an iOS application to help Australians in need. We leveraged Firebase as a Realtime NoSQL Database to store posts. Firebase Authentication services were used to sign in and sign up users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was troublesome to collaborate over Github due to the Swift Storyboard File. This greatly slowed our workflow, as we had to each work on the file one at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we are proud of completing the project in its entirety in the 24 hours allotted. We are also proud of gaining more experience in Firebase, which is beneficial in the technology industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During these 24 hours, we learned how to use Firebase, improved our Swift abilities, and, most importantly, we learned more about the efforts that are going on in Australia to combat the bush fires and save hundreds of thousands of lives.
