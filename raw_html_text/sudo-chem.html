                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a childhood past time game and thought about how this challenging puzzle can be made more fun by implementing chemistry trivia to allow those playing to have fun and learn something new!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like your ordinary Sudoku game, this project requires you to answer a chemistry question if you insert the wrong value. Incorrect answers would result in further point deductions while correct answers will result in no impact on your score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included figuring out how to start the project and how the program would judge would happen next after each user input. Challenges throughout the building of this project included figuring out logical errors and how to account for the many rules of Sudoku that may be conflicting with each other if not thought through thoroughly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are accomplished of the outcome of our project, for it being able to work. After difficult struggles of trying to get the program to work, we were finally able to get everything to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that although a game such as Sudoku may seem easy with just 81 squares with numbers, it definitely isn't easy to implement. In app design, there is so much more to consider than just the logic of how the program would work, including GUI design and UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sudo-Chem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sudo-Chem can be extended by implementing randomized chemistry problems, particularly stoichimoetry problems and periodic trends. Additionally, these problems can be pulled from an API, such as from Wolfram Alpha. The Sudoku board itself can be improved for its appearance and user interface as well as providing varied games for users by using an algorithm to randomly generate valid sudoku games.
