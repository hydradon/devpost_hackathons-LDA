                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a very social, outgoing person, and oftentimes I find myself willing to spend a few dollars for an adventure but with no idea where to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's not to say that there isn't a place for adventure...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've lived in Berkeley for 2 years and even now a friend introduces me to a whole new world that's only a short car ride from my apartment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've discovered many new, exciting things to do this way:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tango
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fishing,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hiking
                </p>
                <p>
                    Horse Racing
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skating
                </p>
                <p>
                    But asking friends or maybe even strangers for suggestions on where to go is always pretty time consuming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought about an app that aggregates locals' suggestions into a list accessible by anyone in an area, and that I could get to pretty easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concierge is an app we created that uses crowdsourcing to find and suggest popular destinations and off the path nooks known to locals, and filters them according to how much it would cost to Uber to them, providing accessibility to highly rated recreational and social venues for people to discover new places to go visit in their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concierge is a native Android app that stores users' recommendations for places on a Parse database in the cloud and uses Google's Location Services to find where you are and suggest places near you that locals in your area have highly rated. It also uses Uber's API to calculate the cost for an Uber and can even call an Uber for you to take you there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up and figuring out the various API's involved in the app. We also had some trouble with setting up the frontend of the app as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a sleek, clean looking UI for the app, as well as figuring out how to use Uber's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with Uber's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Concierge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to take Concierge global, with users all over the world suggesting local haunts in their area and other users learning about these new places. This is a very ambitious vision, but we believe that Concierge will have a place among the rest of the other popular, social based apps that have taken the world by storm.
