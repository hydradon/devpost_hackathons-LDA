                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michigan State University as well as many other colleges do not have an application that clearly lists and displays information related to assignments, tasks, and project due dates. The closest application we have today is online known as D2L and although it is helpful it still has it flaws for usage on mobile devices. The thought behind this application was that it could be a great companion with D2L or a whole separate application to redefine the way we as students gain access to our deadlines and due dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has two screens: the first screen that is an overview of current course overviews and another screen that lists all current due assignments. Each screen has a very clean UI making it clear and obvious for students what assignments are due. The original thought of the app was to either web scrape from a current website, such as D2L, or from a new website that is a companion to this app. Either of those two options would be a way to gain access to all the information listed for each courses assignments however that idea is currently a work in progress. At this time the application is more of a prototype of it's potential and a demonstration of it's potential functionalities.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode and Swift.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web scraping is actually not a very well known operation to do using an iOS application, finding resources and examples of how to do it is minimal and in some cases quite complex.

                <p>
                    A functioning app that looks clean and clear. An app that has high potential and would be a great assistant for students all across the world.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software development process for iOS applications, how to design, build, and deploy.

                    What's next for What's Next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a good way to connect the application to some kind of web service so that way the app can relay information from a instructor input resource such as D2L to gain access to information such as current due dates and new assignments. Design a way to allow the user to get up to date notifications for upcoming due dates and newly posted assignments. Allow the user to click on and mark off recently completed assignments to give the student that satisfaction of completion of assignments to help motivate to move on to "What's Next?".
