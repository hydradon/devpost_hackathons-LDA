                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate when sunlight through my windows shines on my bed and wakes me up before I need to, but I also hate waking up to a dark room when it is already 10am. I really wanted to improve my sleep cycle, but also never wake accidentally wake up before I needed to. The solution? Blindside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blindside syncs your phone's alarms to your blinds and opens them 5 mins before your alarm is about to go off, so you wake up at just the right time, with just the right amount of light in your room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iPhone App:
The user controls this entire system through an iPhone app. The user can manually open/close the blinds through the app and also set preferences for which alarms should the blinds open for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Node.js server:
The server handles all communication between the iPhone App and the embedded controller for the blinds. The server uses MongoDB for user authentication as well as embedded device authentication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embedded:
We use a dragonboard 410c connected to a servo motor and driver. The dragonboard receives commands from the server to open/close the blind and also receives user preferences and sets cronjobs to open/close blinds at the correct time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dragonboard is relatively new and thus had very little support online so we had to experiment a lot to get the board working the way we wanted it to. Communication between multiple devices was also a difficult task since they all were programmed in different languages and had different networking capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to make an iPhone app, a backend server and an embedded device all within 36 hours. Each of these in themselves were huge tasks and each of them had to fall into place like a puzzle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about embedded devices and security on IoT devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blindside
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add support Google home, Amazon alexa and other assistants so this can be part of a larger IoT ecosystem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use light and motion sensors to close blinds when no one is in the room to save energy spent on cooling the room.
