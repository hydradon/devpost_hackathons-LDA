                    This website asks to take the users location and gets a random restaurant within a 10 mile radius of the user. It also gives the user some information about that restaurant.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the
                    <strong>
                        Google Maps
                    </strong>
                    to retrieve the users location and the
                    <strong>
                        Google's Places API
                    </strong>
                    to retrieve information about restaurants in the area's and their information.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of issues with using Googles tools as they are not flexible with requests.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a little bit of
                    <strong>
                        javascript
                    </strong>
                    . We are proud that we got the google places api functioning with parameters.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much because we were not familiar with javascript at all nor any previous experience using google's tools.

                    We hope to expand this into having better parameters and adding the option to add filters such dietary restriction and price.
