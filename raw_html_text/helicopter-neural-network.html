                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are cool, neural networks are cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a neural network which takes in 9 inputs, shown as the red lines as well as momemtum. Every generation, the network is mutated and tested 4 times. The highest average lives on, until it has evolved into a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the input data was hard, as I had to find a way to pass it into the network real-time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I figured out a nice way to display the neural network by using colors for negative/positive, and increasing the width by the weight of each connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My genetic algorithm was really simple, so it takes a long time to learn even simple things.
