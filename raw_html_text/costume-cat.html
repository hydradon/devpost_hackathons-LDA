                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from the many variations of the Github Octocat that people have made. Just the addition of accessories made it into a fun other character, and it would be cool if people could dress up their own Octocat. We decided we didn&rsquo;t want to run into copyright issues, and changed it to our own cat. That also means the game has wider application, such as the eventual use as incentive for information on shelter cats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user will be allowed to select various costume pieces and backgrounds to make the kitty look cat-tastic!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build and design the website. We used Javascript to change the picture that is in place for the different categories. 
The cat and costumes were drawn in Photoshop with an Intuos tablet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with layering different photos on top of each other (for the accessories and clothes), but then we were able to get the positioning right and were able to change the z-index of the different photos. We also were unable to display a picture in the alert box, because we wanted to display a picture and information about a real cat that needs to be adopted. We were struggling to figure out how to get our website hosted using the domain: costumecat.tech, but we eventually got it up and working!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how we were able to come together as a group, combining the different talents and ideas of everyone.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about structuring and styling a website.

                    What's next for Costume Cat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to have Costume Cat have the ability to have more costume variations and backgrounds. In addition, when the cat&rsquo;s image is submitted, we wanted to display information about a cat in need of a home.
