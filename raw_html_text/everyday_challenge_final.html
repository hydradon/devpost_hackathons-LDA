                    Special Prize to be considered for:
Most Socially Useful Hack
                </p>
                <p>
                    Motivation and Idea:
As illustrated in our pitch, human interactions, hangouts, meet-ups, are essential and one of the greatest times in our lives. Yet, seldom we seem to understand or come to a consensus on a common activity that everyone will be happy for. This is what our simple yet hopefully effective android application is hoping to strive towards.

                    The app provides users with a daily challenge, and the UI allows them to connect and broadcast their achievements on social media platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp, but more importantly share their whereabouts and what activity they want to pursue. Based on this, they can locate other users who wish to complete the same challenge, and meet them and get to know them accordingly.
