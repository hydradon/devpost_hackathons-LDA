                    Our inspiration came from attending the workshops the first day of Cypher and playing around with what we learned about html and css.  We then decided to apply our new skills to creating an interesting and entertaining website, leading us to build an application to display memes and jokes that are related to programming and computer science.  Our thinking was that often humor and coding are not thought of together, yet many programmers go through similar, relatable challenges.

                    We spent a large chunk of time debating and questioning our decision for the domain name, as winning the Best Domain Name is one of our goals for this project.  After asking organizers and other hackers their opinions on our punny ideas for names, we decided on &ldquo;segmemetation fault&rdquo;.  This pun references the moderately useless error often raised in C.  We hope that you enjoy the memes we collected and find them engaging and relatable.
