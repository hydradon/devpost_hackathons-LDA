                <p>
                    Twitter is an important part of public discourse. As it becomes more and more image heavy, people who are blind are left out of the conversation. That's where Alt-Bot comes in. Alt-Bot fills the gaps in image content using an image recognition API to add text descriptions.

                    Mention @alt_text_bot in a message or retweet that has an image attached, and you'll get a reply with a text description.

                    Alt-Bot uses APIs from Twitter and

                    The application has captured the attention and imagination of people on Twitter. There have been almost 100 transcriptions by 2:30pm on Sunday, and a handful of

                    . I'm very happy with the quality of the descriptions too.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned not to expect anyone to work harder for the same content. The people I talked to wanted image descriptions inline instead of posting or retweeting. I've already started work on a Twitter client to make this possible.

                    What's next for @alt_text_bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alt-Bot needs to be "push" rather than "pull". That means that I'll be creating a Twitter client that adds descriptions inline as part of the feed.
