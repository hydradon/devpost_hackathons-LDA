                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To have a multiplayer game where people outside of the VR headset and engage with a player in VR

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The VR player is placed in a game where creatures slowly crawl to them.  He/she is able to fend them off with a vr gun.  Players on the browser platform are able to drop bombs into the game by clicking on an image of a map to fend the zombies off.

                    Socket.IO for communication between Unity client and web browser game clients
