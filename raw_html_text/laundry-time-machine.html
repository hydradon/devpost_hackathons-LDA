                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know how Facebook shows you memory posts like "On that day 5 years ago". Well I wanted to have something like wheel where you spin it and you just land somewhere in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks you to enter the Laundry Machine (with Facebook account) and then it start spinning until it finds a picture from the past (randomly). Then it shows it to you. However during the time travel the window got sweaty so you have to clean it with your finger to see the photo :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Facebook Graph API I ask the user to login and give permission to read his feed. I use Javascript (with jQuery) to do all the calls and logic. Once I get the permission I start spinning the wheel (just using some jquery css3 animations). While crawling the FB API I load the sweaty effect simultaneously. Once I find a picture that is big enough I stop the wheel with jquery/css and the user has to clean the window to see the photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I finished what I could (just 5 mins ago) I wanted to publish the app on facebook, but I need a Facebook Developers approval to read this data from the users. I though people would be able to open it on the Hackathon, but facebook gave me a message "5 business days" for the review...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was the javascript callbacks... I mean I've used them many times but every time it is a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I couldn't make sweaty window effect on "Travel again". There is some problem there but I didn't have time to debug it.
                </p>

                    I met a lot of people on the Hackathon.

                <p>
                    Well a friend gave me this idea to match two people and give them a memory that they have together... I want to do that.
