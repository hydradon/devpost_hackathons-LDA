                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people are ready to offer help to people who need it but, it is hard for the donors to connect with the requestors, as in the case of the 2015 Chennai floods. So to make it easier, we wanted to make a platform that will help donors and requestors to connect with each other and exchange essential supplies, which will work regardless of  if internet connection works or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application provides a platform for donors and requestors to connect and exchange essentials, regard less of whether the donors and acceptors have access to the internet.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to properly store and retrive data from a local database.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having built a working application within the provided time even though this is my first hackathon.

                    What's next for Team Everest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Google maps to make it easier for the donor and requestors to find each other, integrating firebase to store user data to the cloud to make is it is seamless if the user wants to switch to another device, making offline connectivity more robust.
