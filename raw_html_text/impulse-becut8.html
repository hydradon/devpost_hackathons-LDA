                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains unacceptably low worldwide, and it is the leading cause of death in developed countries. Sudden cardiac arrest takes more lives than HIV and lung and breast cancer combined in the U.S., where survival from cardiac arrest averages about 6% overall, taking the lives of nearly 350,000 annually. To put it in perspective, that is equivalent to three jumbo jet crashes every single day of the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For every minute that passes between collapse and defibrillation survival rates decrease 7-10%. 95% of cardiac arrests die before getting to the hospital, and brain death starts 4 to 6 minutes after the arrest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet survival rates can exceed 50% for victims when immediate and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is combined with prompt use of a defibrillator. The earlier defibrillation is delivered, the greater chance of survival. Starting CPR immediate doubles your chance of survival. The difference between the current survival rates and what is possible has given rise to the need for this app - IMpulse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cardiac arrest can occur anytime and anywhere, so we need a way to monitor heart rate in realtime without imposing undue burden on the average person. Thus, by integrating with Apple Watch, IMpulse makes heart monitoring instantly available to anyone, without requiring a separate device or purchase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IMpulse is an app that runs continuously on your Apple Watch. It monitors your heart rate, detecting for warning signs of cardiac distress, such as extremely low or extremely high heart rate. If your pulse crosses a certain threshold, IMpulse captures your current geographical location and makes a call to an emergency number (such as 911) to alert them of the situation and share your location so that you can receive rapid medical attention. It also sends SMS alerts to emergency contacts which users can customize through the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With newly-available access to Healthkit data, we queried heart sensor data from the Apple Watch in real time. When these data points are above or below certain thresholds, we capture the user's latitude and longitude and make an HTTPRequest to a Node.js server endpoint (currently deployed to heroku at
                    <a href="http://cardiacsensor.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow">
                        http://cardiacsensor.herokuapp.com
                    </a>
                    ) with this information. The server uses the Google Maps API to convert the latitude and longitude values into a precise street address. The server then makes calls to the Nexmo SMS and Call APIs which dispatch the information to emergency services such as 911 and other ICE contacts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There were many challenges testing the app through the XCode iOS simulators. We couldn't find a way to simulate heart sensor data through our laptops. It was also challenging to generate Location data through the simulator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No one on the team had developed in iOS before, so learning Swift was a fun challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was challenging to simulate the circumstances of a cardiac arrest in order to test the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Producing accurate and precise geolocation data was a challenge and we experimented with several APIs before using the Google Maps API to turn latitude and longitude into a user-friendly, easy-to-understand street address.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first PennApps (and for some of us, our first hackathon). We are proud that we finished our project in a ready-to-use, demo-able form. We are also proud that we were able to learn and work with Swift for the first time. We are proud that we produced a hack that has the potential to save lives and improve overall survival rates for cardiac arrest that incorporates so many different components (hardware, data queries, Node.js, Call/SMS APIs).

                <h2>
                    What's next for IMpulse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond just calling 911, IMpulse hopes to build out an educational component of the app that can instruct bystanders to deliver CPR. Additionally, with the Healthkit data from Apple Watch, IMpulse could expand to interact with a user's pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator as soon as it detects cardiac distress. Finally, IMpulse could communicate directly with a patient's doctor to deliver realtime heart monitor data.
