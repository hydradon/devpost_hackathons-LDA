                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In cyber security, there are many well know tools that exist. I decided that I wanted to understand the underlying mechanics of making a scanner from the ground up, and add more functionality. Hence, banner grabbing was included, an the Scan 'n' Grab was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Scan 'n' Grab is a program that knocks on the "doors" of a computer looking for open "doors" and "doors" that respond with information. A network administrator can use this information to audit what services a server is running, and what version some of the software is running. It can even catch the occasional backdoor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python, with very few imported libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into issues with setting up the gui side of this application, while I had the lower levels of this project running very quickly, getting the "back end", and the "front end", of the project working together took a lot of time and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to build this from scratch within the time frame that was given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of Python: sockets, and tkinter gui.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scan 'n' Grab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An improved gui, and adding more advanced port grabbing for services that is more accurate.
