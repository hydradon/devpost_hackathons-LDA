                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from wanting to save time and improve security. We also thought about one of the scenarios during the NCR workshop. We were inspired by the coming of the cashless age and wanted to come up with a product that would make the future more financially secure and be more convenient to boot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logging into the app should provide you with a glance of all your funding accounts as well as send you electronic receipts. We also tried to track loyalty points and provide a 2 factor authentication per client request on certain cards and or dollar amounts over a preset limit. We also had a concept with a company card that can be used in place of all of your cards that are linked on the app where the 2 factor authentication would help put a stop to unwanted or fraudulent transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Flutter because we haven't tried the technology out yet. We have heard of its rise in the use of making mobile applications and thought to test our strengths with it. We also used a Firebase to log transaction amounts from the Sliver API provided by NCR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Flutter with Firebase costed a lot of us time to learn how to use and by the time we got the hang it, we were worn out. Still, we worked through the night and on as much as we can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have completed most of the application, created a mock Flutter application and been able to figure out how to fetch data from a private API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using NCR's API integrated Python, dash, and mobile cross-platform development was a great experience. We have learn to program in Dart and use Android Studio to make our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our project to accept more payments, digital receipts, and simple UI so that one day there can be an one-stop app for all transactions.
