                    Originally, my plan was to build an app that took pictures of handwritten notes. And then using an AI, it would discern the handwriting and format it properly on a document, including grammar errors, and by using specific keywords it would adding pictures for added ease while studying. This would also solve mathematical equations as well. Halfway through this project my android studio starting acting up and I couldn't solve the issues. It was taking too long to find errors and eventually I changed my idea to have the user search up a specific keyword, academically related and the AI would find data based on the relevancy of the keyword and develop a small crash course on the topic searched. This would use the same formatting techniques as my previous idea and putting it onto a document. It was taking me too long to learn everything but I did learn a lot with these 2 ideas. I learned a lot about machine learning and android studio which is a class I am taking in school. I learned many useful features that could prove useful in the future. With machine learning, I took these ideas as a segway into learning machine learning and AI. It was extremely interesting to learn about AI and has definitely pushed me into learning these things. In the end, I chose to make a simple calculator app just to have something to submit.
