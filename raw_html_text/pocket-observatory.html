                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There aren't many ways to view active satellites! This is a way to garner public interest in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to view satellites currently in orbit using a Google Cardboard or Daydream, for an immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google VR SDK, Unity C#, and lots of snacks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially were going to use a live feed of real coordinate data using an API by n2yo, but it is a challenge to convert latitude and longitude to Unity coordinates, and make API requests through Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks very immersive and peaceful!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The key to a good VR experience is good use of the camera and lighting.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pocket Observatory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live data that uses your own coordinates to give an accurate picture of where the satellites are!
