                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates came up with the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a document and searches for keywords and uses those keywords to find a picture summary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program with Java Swing for the GUI, and Java to process the files and gather keywords. Additionally, we used the Google Image search API as well as parsing JSON using third-party libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we were going to make a web app, but we didn't know how to create .jsp files in Google App Engine to store the information. In the end we decided to make a Swing interface to build on the back-end coding we completed already.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish our project in 10 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about web design and development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Visual Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop the web app in the future if we did not have the time constraints we had here.
