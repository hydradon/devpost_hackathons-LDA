                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android app that matches up people into study groups based on their calendars and classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Takes users and creates study groups based on their free time from their calendars, prior knowledge of the class material, self-estimated priority they give the class, preferences in learning styles, and classes they have in common. It also saves people time by only matching them with people they could meet with within the constraints of their schedules-as what good is a study group if you actually never meet up to study?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users then have the option to join their chosen study groups in a message/chat board to discuss and set up study sessions (which will be easier because the groups are formed based on the common free times of members), private message other members, and manage membership like kicking and leaving.
                </p>

                    Challenges We Had
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with Firebase and Android Studio, and we also wanted to eventually perhaps incorporate Google Maps API but ran out of time. We also wanted to eventually implement a machine learning algorithm for study group formation and a chat board for the individual study groups. But this was definitely a cool project we had a lot of fun working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot to work to do and a lot of learning we could do with this project still! So we'll probably keep updating it and maybe even conduct some research on what makes study groups really successful and incorporate that in.
