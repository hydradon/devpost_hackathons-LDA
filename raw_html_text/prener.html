                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an original idea for a project, but then we found out L&auml;hiTapiola had Wellmo which did pretty much everything we had planned. This gave us the idea to take Wellmo even further!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gamifies keeping yourself healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used L&auml;hiTapiola customized Wellmo environment to gain data from users activities to create a gamified experience on keeping yourself healthy.  Currently using Wellmo and polar loop 2 pedometer data. Walking challenge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraint and local development environments slowness with huge data chunks provided by l&auml;hitapiola. Lack of ready-made data export tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the last full day we chatted with L&auml;hiTapiola to gain more info about the possibilities of Wellmo. They gave a call to the developers who in turn gave us a secret gateway for the data that our development polar loop 2 collected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minimum viable product development is the way to go. Should've kept it even more simple so the end result would've been more polished.
Gamification of health data was a learning experience. Since we both work in software development we noticed that we should try something even more off the chain during these hackathons.
