                    We were inspired by an online simulation called Genetic Football, which uses genetic algorithms to gradually create better football playing algorithms. This led us to create a game where enemies function in a similar manner, with the enemies who survive the longest per level passing on their superior genetic traits to offspring enemies in the following level. You rack up points by killing your enemies, but be careful, because if you don't kill at least five enemies per round or if your health depletes to zero, the game will end. Of course, the more enemies you kill, the more points you earn, which you can use to upgrade yourself in the shop at the end of each level.
