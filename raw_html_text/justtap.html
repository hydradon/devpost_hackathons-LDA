                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a time where a gradually increasingly reliance on technology creates increasing interpersonal divisions, we sought to create an application that instead augments daily interactions between people. Rather than another application to shrink distances separating people, we decided to apply a unique technological mechanism to dating on a more personal level, to further the connections we make
                    <em>
                        here and now
                    </em>
                    . In particular, we decided to focus on many social impediments that exist dating and meeting new people, and adapt a unique technological mechanism to offer the possibility of an avenue around these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The premise behind JustTap is simple: escalating a conversation into something more meaningful is risky, the introduction of an application as a third party arbitrator into conversations can ease this. In the course of a conversation, a user can opt to demonstrate interest via a &ldquo;Tap&rdquo; on their smartphone, subtly projecting their interest via Bluetooth to the nearest Bluetooth-enabled phone. The owner of this second phone is and remains completely unaware of this projected interest&hellip;unless he or she also has such an app, and independently decides to &ldquo;Tap&rdquo; themselves. In the case that both users unknowingly &ldquo;tap&rdquo; into each other, the app will alert both users to their match, trade their contact info, and reveal the mutual interest in each other.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JustApp is an application coded in Swift for IOS, coded from scratch over the course of ~36 hours of KHE.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team lacked experience in app development, having only completed a much simpler iPhone app more than a year ago, forcing us to struggle and seek online resources to complete our objectives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although lacking extreme experience in app development, we were able to create this fully fledged app in less than two days.  I'm proud that we not only created working code but also a strong UI base system, something none of us had ever done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the specifics of coding in Swift and using XCode for User Interfaces, especially for multipeer connectivity, which was the basis of our app.  Through researching how we would accomplish our idea, we also read through a lot of Core Bluetooth API and now have a much stronger knowledge-base on the implementation of the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JustTap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JustTap is far from complete. Potential future plans include a more decorative interphase (ours is minimalistic, focusing on function), more detailed logs for past matches, a more comprehensive profile system beyond barebones contact details, and a scanning feature to determine if other JustTap users are nearby.
