                    Using artist similarities measures (

                    </strong>
                    ) and at the end of the song the process re-starts, analyzing again the last 500 tweets, computing the target artist and playing a song.

                    . The aggregated mood is computed assuming that people play a more lively song when they are in a good mood and it's computed using the

                    [1] A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). See
