                    It's important to have insurance, but nobody likes shopping policies and keeping track of the paperwork. We created a conversational platform that finds the best coverage for your lifestyle and takes the pain out of managing existing policies.

                    is the one-stop shop for taking out insurance and managing existing policies. If

                    can suggest home insurance policies and work out the required coverage and options like bike coverage&mdash;all in a conversation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our conversational AI with Rasa, a framework for chatbots and assistants. Google App Engine powers our serverless backend. Users interact with our bot in a Facebook Messenger conversation, where we use interactive components for a more engaging experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the Google Maps API for address validation. We also have a very good domain: whatinsurance.net
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        What Insurance
                    </em>
                    is platform-independent, but we chose Facebook Messenger for its maturity and interactivity. With a few configuration tweaks it even works on Google Home or Amazon Echo&mdash;but it would be rather bizarre to shout car insurance details into a smart speaker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought a lot about regulatory compliance and privacy considerations. Transactions are reviewed and finalised in a secure environment inside a web view, and users can access their contract documents through other channels as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have solid models for intent extraction, but obviously we couldn&rsquo;t train them as much as we&rsquo;d have liked to. The more
