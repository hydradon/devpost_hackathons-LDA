                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organising any event is a hustle. Especially when all your friends or colleagues are located in different areas of the city and cannot decide on the location.
                    <strong>
                        Locale finds a location that is equally easily accessible by all participants with public transportation.
                    </strong>
                    Alternatively users can propose locations themselves and then vote on them, to avoid long arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focused on public transportation in Berlin because it works around the clock, is environment-friendly, convenient and is a primary choice for many party-goers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We record positions of the participants on a map and create an isochrone map for each participant. An appropriate location according to a previously defined filter is then searched in the areas where isochrones overlap. The location determined by Locale is equally accessible by all participants and guarantees the shortest possible trip for everybody. The participants can also receive a list of optimal locations that they can vote on if desired guaranteeing hustle-free and fair organisation for everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Isochrone maps are a challenging and computing-consuming concepts. One could not rely exclusively on available options accessible through API. A lot of optimisation and computation had to be done to find the optimal location on the map. Time constraints

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing and combining many APIs and technologies.
Determining the optimal position based on isochrone maps of areas accessible through public transportation. 
Being able to develop a concept for a meaningful application that can be used in real life situations in such short time. 
Organising a team of people who never previously worked together.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Locale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because many events are organised in WhatsApp groups and other chats, one could integrate this feature in an AI assistant or a chat-bot, to help users organize events even more convenient. 
Our concept can be extended with an extended interface for location selection based on multiple activities and Trip Advisor or Google reviews. 
Many meetups end up with a bill that has to be shared. Paypal integration can support such use cases.
                    <br>
                    Car and bike-sharing transportation opportunities may be added to the analysis.
