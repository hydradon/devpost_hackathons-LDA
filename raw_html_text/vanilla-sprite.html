                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to write a program that automated a tedious task in order to make time for other projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automates the transfer of data from .csv files to text documents based on user specifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started the build in c++ but migrated to java for simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble creating substrings within a loop in c++ in a reasonable amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A c++ method that splits strings based on a delimiter parameter that can be any character, as well as the fact that we were able to successfully write code to automate the data transfer we sought to in the first place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    File I/O in java, substrings in c++, split() in java
                </p>

                    What's next for Vanilla Sprite
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of the software as a chrome extension that transfers data between Google sheets and Google Docs (as well as other google products)
