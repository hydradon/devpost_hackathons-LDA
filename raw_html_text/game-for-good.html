                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sam Agnew's Twilio game genie inspired me to make this hack. Also, I wanted to build something that went with the theme this year. However, I didn't think hacking a game would seem important to others, so I added a twist!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, my hack uses a Lua script that sits and waits for certain actions to happen in-game (like losing a life), and it communicates these changes to my backend application. The backend application will then communicate with a payment api (Paypal), and donate money randomly to among a list of charity organizations. 
My hack enables video game streamers to play retro games for charity, and encourage viewers to also game for good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used, python, Lua, the Paypal api for sending payment, and a game emulator called fceux, which provides an environment for running my Lua scripts.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Lua...I intended to do a LOT more to this project, unfortunately, I had a hard time learning about this language. Also had a little difficulty using Paypal.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a working demo, and it works well enough to demonstrate it's purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Lua, and using the Paypal Api
                </p>

                    What's next for Game For Good
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably will add more features. And increase the difficulty of the game through ram hacking.
