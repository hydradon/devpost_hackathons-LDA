                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Kid protection and antivirus web protection are based in a listed ranking, without scanning really the content of the web, even more, they are usually not centered in which information the web is transmitting to the reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main idea is to develop a webApp in which you can enter a URL and it analyze the content and show if the content is appropriate. Beside the web we planned to build a browser extension so parents can block innapropiate contents for his sons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given an URL, it analyses its content and determines if it is likely to be cyber bulling or profanity and the sentiment polarity it has and it gives a punctuation based on the content. It also shows you the latest URLs scanned and the result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web at an online workspace (c9.io) in PHP and with the Laravel framework which extracts the content of the web and sends it to the bark.us API to analyze it. Also, we made a Chrome extension to make scanning fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main idea was to develop a travel search algorithm based on the days and the price but without fixing any destination, but he ran in troubles with APIs and had to change our project suddenly, so we had to think about another idea at midnight.
Not everyone at the team knew about back-end and web so it was a challenge for them to learn it ongoing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the frustrated project, we were able to continue with a completely different idea and learn new things a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with APIs, PHP, Lavarel and chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CensorIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could improve our user experience and do massive web analyze, for example analyzing all the web history. Also, with the export data option and more analyzing features or graphics and statistics or parental alerts. We also are planning to extend to social media, for example blocking offensive Facebook posts, analyzing conversation contents and alert parents if it's necessary.
