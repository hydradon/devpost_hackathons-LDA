                    Workspace App tagged 'Familiar with your destination before getting there or on the spot".
It was a day out in a big Shopping mall, located in Lagos, Nigeria. I was overjoyed that I was just entering every available location in the mall and getting back myself, I discover that being so much enclosed that I couldn't find my way back to the entry of the mall, and it can be so embarrassing when you need to ask your way out. So that done on me that if assuring I have something that can just show me my way out, it will have to save the embarrassment of asking someone else way out.
And to add to the story, If I have to know my way before coming to the mall (I mean if I have to know how to navigate my way before visiting the mall, I will have not been overwhelmed of how big the mall is and it will have gives me any ideas of how thing work.
This gave birth to this workspace app build by our team.
