                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since 6 degree of freedom joysticks generally are custom built and are not commercially available, this project attempts to give a non DIY solution which the user only needs a Wii Remote and webcam (also Bluetooth adapter).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it reads orientation information from the Wii Remote and attempts to approximate the world position using the webcam for object tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used C++ for reading information from the Wii Remote and using OpenCV for location data. Used Unity for visualizing the results of the input data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accuracy of motion detection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Computer Vision, Inter process communication, Unity.

                    What's next for 6 DOF Wii Remote Joystick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the accuracy of world coordinate detection and possibly creating a driver.
