                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we're a group of engineering and computer science students who want to make use of our skills to fix a problem!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to solve language barriers for those who use Slack to communicate in cross platform teams!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used stdlib to deploy the slack bot. Additionally, we used google translate api, and slack apis to implement its features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems learning javascript and and rest apis for the first time. Some terms such as async, await, and other new features in the language were bizarre since we've never used it before. Learning curve was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to complete the project using different technologies we have never tried before. In the end we created a slack bot capable of translating messages to a different language in real time. Languages are configurable!
                </p>
