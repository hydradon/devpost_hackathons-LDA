                    Inspiration: We wanted to make it easier for people to cook at home
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It takes in user input and puts it in an array to be stored to check a list of recipes and see if you have enough ingrdients to make that specific meal.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used eclipse to create a GUI in Java.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: It was difficult to implement the arraylist for the recipe tab.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Most of the team have never created a GUI before, and therefore we were proud of the fact that we were able to come out with a semi-working prototype. We also did not work upon any type of template.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Most of the team was able to learn Java GUI and we were able to learn how to pull from an arraylist.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Refrigerator: We want to see the reicpe function working properly as we invisioned.
