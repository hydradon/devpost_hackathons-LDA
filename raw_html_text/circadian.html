                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Burdened with school work, high school students often rely on insufficient and inconsistent weekday sleep schedules coupled with a weekend 'crash and recharge' periods. This combination ultimately negatively impacts their health. Students across the world are often mistaken on how to correctly fix and maintain a regular, healthy sleep schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Circadian helps you fix your sleep schedule by tracking the number of hours you sleep every night and providing insightful feedback on your sleeping habits.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Circadian was built primarily with Java in Android Studio. In order to build a helper 'Sleep Bot,' the Bluemix API and IBM-Watson were used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering that we had limited knowledge on Android app development and zero knowledge about Bluemix and IBM-Watson, programming the databases for the app, getting the Bluemix APIs to work with the app were particularly challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Circadian was our first experience with Android Studio and within a period of 24 hours (a period notably consisting of persistent self-teaching, debugging, and skillful navigation of StackOverflow) we found ourselves quickly adapting to the newfound world of Android app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Android app development--enough to allow us to lay a strong foundation for Circadian--within 24 hours. Thanks to IBM's workshops, we also learned how to use IBM's Bluemix to create an AI messenger bot.
                </p>
