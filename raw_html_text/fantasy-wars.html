                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We based our game concept of a gba game called Advanced Wars, but we also had the Fire Emblem series in mind while making it.  The game is in a fantasy setting, so where Advanced Wars features tanks and battle copters, we included swordsmen and dragons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two players are initialized on a map with three buildings; a city, a barracks, and an aviary.  There's also an unclaimed port in the center.  The game features land, sea, and air units which are each built in a separate location.  The units can be bought with gold, which accumulates as income depending on how many building you control.  Every unit can move, attack, and try to capture a building during its turn.  Capturing buildings take time to capture though, and take more turns for weakened units.  There are ten different troops, each with separate strengths.  The units can move and take cover on their turns, and both are affected by the terrain they're passing through.  For instance, mountains are slow to traverse but offer more cover than travelling by road.  Most land units can also be loaded into zeppelins so that they can be transported and dropped in otherwise inaccessible areas.  The game is over when your opponent loses all their troops.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea was to create the game as an android app, but learning to navigate android studios and dig through the documentation was more time consuming than we anticipated.  By the end of the first day we felt we were forced to begin from scratch in Java and make a computer app instead in order to finish the project by the time limit.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the whole we were proud of our ability to produce the amount of code that we did.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly what we learned from this project was how to create workarounds to the more complicated problems we ran into, and how to restructure our code in a way that would allow us to avoid such conflicts.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Fantasy Wars
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Fantasy Wars would be larger maps, and more of them.  Our dream version of this game would feature a single player campaign with a tech tree as well.  We'd also like the ability to choose between 2 and 4 players for a game.
