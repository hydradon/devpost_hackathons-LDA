                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this website after hearing about students at our school, Irvington High School, are dealing with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we are beginners at html, it took us a while to learn and figure out what to do.
