                    Everything from televisions to hand-held devices can be controlled hands-free with remote gesture controls.  The inexpensive solution presented here communicates hand gestures over wifi using two ESP8266 modules.  The wrist-wearable host reads acceleration and velocity data from a 10 DOF IMU, creates its own wireless access point, and publishes processed gestures.  The second ESP8266 acts as a client that listens and responds to the host (demo: LED).

                    This was my team's first foray into wifi, IoT, and IMU's.  The barrier to entry was encouragingly lower than expected, and version 2.0 will be smaller, faster, and more user-friendly.
