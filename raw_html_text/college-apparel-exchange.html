                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my teammate and I got into our respective colleges, Cornell and Carnegie Mellon, we realized we each had shirts from each other's future alma mater. The only logical solution for us was to trade shirts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College exchange is a website where the user can upload images and information about college shirts into a marketplace. Other users then can make counteroffers and if this is accepted, mailing info will be given to each of the users to send to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built College Exchange using python, html, css, app-engine and google cloud storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was incorporating the search function into the website. It took time to be able to search through the database of entries in the marketplace using user inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment that we are proud of is rendering the images of the T-shirts in the marketplace. We originally planned to just show information about the shirt, such as the color and size. However, we managed to display images of the clothing using blob image processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout our project, we learned how to organize code and incorporate different types of code together depending on functionality. We also learned a lot about data flow, data storage, and rendering data on the website.
                </p>

                    What's next for College Apparel Exchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the website to all types of clothing. This clothing exchange program would help people keep up with changing trends and interests.
