                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sparked by the legacy of Baymax, we decided to make PlatyBox, the weather station and natural disaster relief equivalent of the ever-popular character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PlatyBox is a weather station featuring temperature, humidity, air quality, air pressure, and UV sensors; in addition, it uses these sensors to predict natural disasters and provide safe relief. With each household, office, and public building meant to possess one PlatyBox, a database of PlatyBoxes is created, allowing data to transferred and households to be plotted on a map. This then allows households to mark whether they are safe or not, facilitating the rescue and contact of those in need.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used various sensors from the Hardware Lab and the plushie in the swag bag to build the physical portion. We used Google Cloud APIs
