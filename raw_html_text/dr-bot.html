                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than a billion people use messenger on a daily basis and we thought it would be cool to make something that would enable the users to check some things related to health right there without leaving the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now messenger bot can search the web for basic symptoms to find cures. Also, it has can search for hospitals near the patient's location.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the messenger platform and javascript. We also used IBM Watson's conversation API
