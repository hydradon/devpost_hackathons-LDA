                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baby Einstein brings the world to baby with developmental products incorporating a unique combination of language, music, art, animals and nature. We wanted to extend that experience with the Alexa platform.

                <p>
                    Baby Einstein Story Time walks you through your own adventure. Listen as Callahan the Caterpillar and Neptune the Turtle help you explore your world but
                    <em>
                        you
                    </em>
                    choose which way to go.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was built in JS/node.js using the AWS Lamdba service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging session state is really trick on the AWS platform but we leverage test events and Cloudwatch to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created high fidelity recordings of each character to help enhance the experience - we're proud of how we've stitched those samples all together to create a really fun skill. We also enjoyed creating great cross-Echo platform content for both regular Echo's and the Show (card content).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Error handling is critical to the developer of any skill. Expect the unexpected with kids. For example, if you ask them what is your name, you might get back a response that says: "I am a pineapple" - and so your skill needs to handle that seamlessly and with minimal friction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would like to expand the range of stories and experiences for the Alexa platform.
