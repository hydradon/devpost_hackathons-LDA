                    We have all experienced the time when we wish to try on an item of clothing found on Pinterest, but unable to due to the constraints of our current online retail systems. Our product VRClothing aims to solve this problem by providing users with a novel method of interacting with clothing items sold by retail companies.

                    This is our first time working together. We are proud of the extent to which we were able to get to know each other in a short span of time and collaborate in an effective manner. Furthermore, this is our first time working with the Leap Motion platform. We were able to learn quickly the workings of the platform from official documentation, online tutorials, as well as further mentorship.

                    <li>
                        Although a design process may seem to go smoothly, there are always risks involved and we must prepare for these tumultuous moments through risk management. For example, just 8 hours before submission, our team encountered significant difficulties with the projection of clothing onto the 3D human model. In the end, we had the make certain compromises in order to push forward.

                    <li>
                        We each had different styles of solving problems. It was interesting to recognize these differences and to learn from each other.
