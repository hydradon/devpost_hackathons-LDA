                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of people work and commute to the center of the city, making parking much harder to find. Innovation factory's new technology is able to gain city wide information and through that, we thought to make an app to show the best parking spots around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By putting in your destination, the app will search close by parking areas and produce a map of the best location to park in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By implementing CityIQ's API, a map API from Google/Bing along with a rest API, we have made an application to search, determine and display the information to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joining all the individual parts together was most definitely the challenge of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement the maps API to make many of our features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group had learnt a lot about the development process, while also gaining a lot of knowledge on using API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EZSpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for EZSpace is to combine all the parts and create a fluid app. When the user base is large enough and is a larger spread of the CityIQ technology, we would be able to expand to other city's as well and eventually have a global reach. This would require more features and development.
