                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all the times you wanted to punch your friends through the Interwebs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a fighting game in which you connect your phone to your computer across the web. Using your phone as a controller and your computer as a screen, you can move your character around the world, thrusting with your phone to punch other players, and screaming into it to power up your punches.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With skill and finesse.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript doesn't play nice with phone accelerometers and microphones. The HTML5 Canvas has some tricky syntax.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We looked really stupid screaming at our phone to test it.

                    What we learned

                    How not to screw up.
