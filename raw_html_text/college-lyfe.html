                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to help fellow students be involved more in the community as well as a way to improve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the user dates, locations, and more for activities, restaurants, night clubs and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to help build the website from scratch on Cloud9. We used google maps and calendar as the means to show location and times of events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems with CSS and HTML not functioning as expected. API's not working with plans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to use google maps to show the locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API's may not work as expected. API's require lots of underlying code that may or may not be provided with instructions by Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Lyfe?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the development and possibly hosting it for future college students to use.
