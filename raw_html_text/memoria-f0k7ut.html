                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration towards this app was because we wanted help out seniors. We know they have trouble in their final years in their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It includes memory-strengthening exercises, and a journal to take pictures and store memories. We also include their medical and personal information, in case they forget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Xcode 10 and Swift 4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we wouldn't agree on everything, and we had to eventually reach a compromise. This helped build team skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we finished most of our app, and have a working prototype. We are also proud that we were able to move on despite the challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we shouldn't argue, because it just wastes time, and try to work as often as possible. We also learned we should take short breaks, so we don't too stressed out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memoria
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add notifications, so the user can remember to do daily activities such as calling their child, or taking their daily medicine.
