                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A member of our group has a life-threatening dairy allergy, and another is vegetarian. The process of finding safe options in restaurants and other events for them is difficult and time-consuming. It means that they, and people like them all over the world have to trust others with their lives- others who don't always know the answers to the questions they have about the food they eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has a simple interface. One one side, a restaurant can register with the app and provide the app access to all of their menu options, listing which items contain certain common allergens (wheat, dairy, soy, fish, etc.) or apply to certain dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan). A user can register with the app and provide information as to their allergies or dietary restrictions, and the app creates a custom search and save feature for them to keep track and find new places they can eat safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android Studio using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we had used a Google API, and it was difficult trying to integrate it into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea that actually had some social significance and could affect and be used by a wide range of people, and being able to see it come to life in a short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API keys and how to build dependencies into Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MayContain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a user save and potential database feature so that information can be accessed outside of the mobile app, potentially in a web portal.
