                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I derived my inspiration to develop a solution on who to improve our health care  after experiencing a diffcult time just to see a doctor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is aiming at speeding up the rate at which patients are attended to at the hospital and so much other.
The system does the following:
Handles Doctors appointment and Patients on queue to see the doctor.
It has interface for Pharmacy,  Receptionist,  Doctor,  Nurse,  Lab attendant and the main Admin.
The admin has d following features; he can add staffs or remove staffs from records,  handles the information on welcome page and oversees the progress of each doctors and category of staff(doctor,  nursez pharmacy,  receptionist,  and lab attendant).
The Doctor has the following features;
Sees patient on queue and can call them using the system in which the receptionist sees the call and inform the appropraite patienta,  he also seess his appointments,  and he can request for test directly in the app which is program to forward it to the lab attendant. He can also make prescription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Receptionist:
Creates patients card details and add patienta to queue and creates appaointments for doctor and makes all other payments needed and assign nurse and doctor to a patient and also responsible for admitting patient
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nurse:
The system shows the nurse the list of patients she/he is in charge of,  his progress and also handles appointments etc.
The Pharmacy:
View drugs in stores
Issue reciept for drugs which the receptionist will use to make payment and issue drug to patients etc.
The Lab Attendant;
Recieves doctor's test request and runs it and submit the result to the doctor through the system and can run test for other patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we have the Welcome/Login Page.
Its determines who is loginin based on d login id and password and opens the appropriate interface.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java and CSS and its a desktop app
