                <p>
                    In a world where new technologies are constantly disrupting industries, we wanted to create a hack that not only used these new technologies but also helped businesses onboard the necessary talent in order to keep up with increasing competition.

                    With TalentLedger you can upload your current resume to our application. From there, we will use machine learning to classify the content and learn more about you. You can send a URL to your former institutions (alma mater, companies, etc.) where they can review your claims and verify that you worked or studied at X and did Y. Our application then logs their confirmation on the blockchain. Now your skills and academic pursuits are verified on the blockchain.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python3 and deep learning to create the natural language processing classifier in the Google Cloud. To interact with the blockchain we used the Ethereum Virtual Machine and node.js to write and deploy smart contracts in the language solidity. The front end was created with Angular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main issue we had was integrating our stack. Rohan R. was using a machine learning stack, Brian was using a blockchain stack and Rohan V. was creating the front end on Angular. Getting everything connected was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get high confidence levels when it came to matching the resume to the specified industry. We were also proud that we were able to interact with the blockchain from the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot, the technologies we used are fairly new and none of us consider ourselves "experts". What is important is that we practice our collaborative problem-solving skills while also learning about new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TalentLedger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to test our software on the client facing side. Getting feedback from the end user is important, our technology should be able to be used by anyone, including those that are not tech oriented.
