                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our car app is simple, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It communicates with the android app and sends the relevant data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was to solve the relation between mileage and coming up with  a formula that mapped speed to fuel economy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how the various aspects of fuel and how they relate with speed, throttle etc. Also we learned jQuery.
                </p>
