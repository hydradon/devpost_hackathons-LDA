                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every now and then we all come across something that annoys us, disgusts us, a nuisance. But often we don't try to fix it, but instead learn to live with it. You walk across your neighborhood everyday on your way to work and it's riddled with obscene graffiti, you walk across a street riddled with garbage from the nearby food carts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You notice these things, and they annoy you for a few days. But soon, you stop looking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cleanhood is a solution to fix these nuisances in life and to stop ignoring them!
We created a crowd sourced aggregation platform that allows a user to simply take a pic of a neighborhood nuisance, geotag it and request volunteers to sign up for a clean up drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a native Android application backed by Node.js and MongoDB. We used Firebase and Twilio to support real-time notifications.
                </p>
