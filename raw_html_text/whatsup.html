                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How people second guess what they tweet because of scrutiny, and impact social media has in our day to day lives
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user's tweets only show up to him or herself. As a way of remaining independent of the public. Effectively personalizing the social network without taking away from the experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user also recieves personal reminders to help them keep track of their day to day lives and has shortcuts to instagram, facebook, phone calls, and text messaging.
