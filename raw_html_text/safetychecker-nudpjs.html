                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was to provide the community with an app that allow individuals who would be walking in a potentially dangerous area to alert their contacts if they were in trouble and couldn't access their phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to input their desired contacts they would like to alert. These desired contacts would then be alerted after a certain time set by the user. This alert will be avoided when if the user presses a button that resets the timer back to the original set time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android Studio which uses Java. To build the database that would hold the contacts, we also needed to use SQLite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to add a map and location functionality that would send texts to contacts about the user's eta and distance from destination. Unfortunately we did not have time to implement this feature.
Both of us were fairly new to Android Studio so we had to learn a lot of syntax to that would allow us to create the different parts of the app such as making the timer, creating and updating a database, sending texts, SMS permissions. It was a huge learning process.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that it actually ran and was able to send texts. It was surprising how much we were able to get done with the limited time and knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By creating this project, we learned a lot more about Android Studio and how to use it. Learning how to use SQLite and making a database was also another big milestone because that is a feature that is fundamental for probably all future apps we would be planning to make.

                    What's next for SafetyChecker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps for SafetyChecker is to use Google Maps API to implement that location features that we originally wanted to be included in the app. Having the ability to use location for safety would allow increased functionality and safety for our users.
