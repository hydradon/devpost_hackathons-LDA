                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I lost my grandmother to an incompetent doctor and almost lost my partner during travel to a rare tropical illness that was misdiagnosed by two doctors. Additionally, my military service in austere parts of the world illuminated varying degrees of poverty to include a lack of access to healthcare services. CarpeMed's vision is to ensure that access to uncompromised healthcare isn't only for the wealthy. Ten years from now we want to reduce medical deserts by fifty percent ensuring that historically marginalized groups and those in emerging markets benefit from the synergies of technology and medical advancements. The CarpeMed app will facilitate early diagnosis, minimize logistical hurdles, and be the primary platform for swift humanitarian response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CarpeMed is built for international travel and provides global access to your health data and health providers so you can travel freely whether prepared or not. CarpeMed's mobile-optimized platform allows you to carry critical medical information with you for tailored medical treatment with vetted medical providers no matter where you are in the world. CarpeMed sits at the intersection of travel and healthcare serving those with pre-existing medical conditions and emergent medical needs by allowing the former to curate a travel experience with informed proximity to the best treatment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided on Google Firebase for our database. The front end utilizes ReactJS to create an experience for both Android and iOS devices, as well as providing tools for map integration. The application interfaces with Google Firebase for a secure login protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to integrate mapbox with React Native, so we used react-native-maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CarpeMed's user interface and the cohesion of our team. As a combat veteran, the strength of the team is essential and this was a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the capabilities of React Native, as well as the synergies between our mission and the user experience. To be sure, the intent is for the user to feel embraced in the intuitive care of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CarpeMed:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transitioning from a pre-accelerator program at Berkeley Haas to an Accelerator Program in the Spring.
