                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within five years of release, about 76.6% of prisoners are arrested again. The prison system takes these people out of society and then expects them to reintegrate and become good citizens upon release. However, after leaving prison most people feel lost and could be left without transportation, source of income, or even housing. The only way to combat chronic crime is to take active steps in providing resources to help people become productive members of their community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JHipster to create a spring-boot back-end with angular front-end. Python is used to scrape information from the web. H2DB provides a database to store all of the information we provide. We use google-cloud platform and hosted it on kubernetes to create a highly scalable web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wasted a lot of time trying to get authentication working using keycloak, but eventually decided that it would be better to forgo a login system so our app could be as accessible as possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web scraping
Having an app that looks good
Feeling like we could make the difference for someone thinking of committing crime to survive
Staying up for 24-hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying an app using JHipster
Don't use keycloak for anything other then a built in function and even then....
