                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our purpose is to make taking medications easier. According to multiple studies surveying a range of ages, a shocking 50% of people have to regularly take prescription drugs. Given such a large percentage, problems such as forgetting to take one's medication, taking it at improper times, or accidentally taking it too often, are bound to occur on a large scale. That's where we come in. For those with too many prescriptions to easily keep track of or for a loved one with memory problems like dementia, we provide an easy to use interface though the Amazon Echo, which allows you to log the times of your medicine intake and receive alerts if you forget. Additionally, should you experience any type of emergency situation and are in need of immediate medical assistance, Remembrall has a built in feature to alert your family or caretakers and emergency response teams of your situation with a simple voice command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we ran into a lot of difficulties integrating the twilio api, Amazon echo, and Microsoft azure database, our current features are fairly limited. We are able the run the Remembrall skill on the echo, which includes speaking commands to it and receiving a personalized response. We also implemented the twilio api in node.js to send alert texts, but were unable to get it to work in the lambda function for the echo. We also created a Microsoft azure database to store the medical information of users, but again were unable to connect it to the echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built many components for this project, including a basic twilio implementation, a Microsoft Azure database, a lambda function for the echo, and a website through html, css, and javascript. We worked incrementally for each of the parts, starting by just sending texts through a basic twilio implementation, creating the azure database, writing the voice commands for the echo, and building the website. We then attempted to merge these simple components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to the aforementioned difficulties with merging our various back end components, we struggled with the creation of a usable database. Our goal was to use azure, but we ran into a lot of problems with its accessibility settings. We also tried DynamoDB from Amazon Web Services, but still were not able to connect it with the echo's lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write an AWS lambda function to program our Amazon Echo. Additionally, we learned a lot about integrating all of our backend code together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remembrall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want the Echo to be able to call someone in emergency situations based on a voice command and also to log different users and their unique medicines.
