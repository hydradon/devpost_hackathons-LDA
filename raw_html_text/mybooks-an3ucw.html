                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to empower students to find better deals on textbooks, rather than continue to be subjugated to the expensive prices at the bookstore.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows UCSC students to list offers to buy or sell textbooks, and helps them meet up and negotiate a fair exchange price.
