                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed something similar for my lengthy home project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects to a centralized server hosting your SQL admin account information so that client's don't need to have this information to retrieve SQL queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used C# and the .Net framework to create a TCP connection between host and client that will provoke the client to ask for a particular SQL query with paramaters and the server will return said information from the SQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to and disconnecting became an issue half way through along with other factors such as DNS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create a product that is reusable and attachable to seemingly any project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SQL Data Retriever
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will be attached to my long standing development project and potentially released as an open source framework that will allow it to be easily implementable to anyone's project.
