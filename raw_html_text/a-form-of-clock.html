                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group and I thought it would be fun to make an alarm clock that does more harm than good to the user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much right now, it's mostly just a clock
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally with C++ and a time library, but now with the Qt Framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group issues, and obtaining the necessary building materials
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixed a bug with Qt that prevented me from using it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pre-Planning a project with a group would've been a much better idea. I learned a lot about the groundwork of app/software development with a GUI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Form of Clock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably the recycling bin, than learning more about the Framework that built it.
