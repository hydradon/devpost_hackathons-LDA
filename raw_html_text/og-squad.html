                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gaming industry is growing very quickly among the younger generation, so we were inspired to use this as a means to create a fun and educational game that prompts young kids to make decisions about money management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    Allows kids to explore the benefits and drawbacks of spending vs saving money.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most team members were non-technical, so we had to expand off of an existing teammate&rsquo;s project and could not implement all our ideas fully due to constraints on technical knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Gained exposure to the logic behind coding and familiarity with control flow and how to program.
