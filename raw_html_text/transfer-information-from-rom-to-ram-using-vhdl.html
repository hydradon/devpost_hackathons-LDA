                    This project helped me to understand computer architecture.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The project takes input a signal of a button on Basys 3 Board, and transfer data from built-in ROM to RAM. After transferring data, the RAM data is display on the segment display of Basys 3 Board.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The main components are an 8-bit counter, a ROM, a RAM, a Seven Segment Display (SSEG) and a Finite State Machine (FSM) module. The first state of the FSM is display data in RAM, which is at this point all zeros. When the button is pressed, data flows from ROM to RAM, and when the transfer process is finished, the new data of RAM is displayed on Basys 3 board.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    One challenge I ran into was the clock was set too slow for the display, so when I was debugging the program. I couldn't see any display. The clock issue was fixed, but the display is still wrong.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    After many hours of debugging, I'm finally able to run the simulation for the transfer process.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned to be patient and analyze the problem carefully. The problem in coding can be caused by many sources. It's important to check every variable in the program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    After the transfer and display processes, I plan to add bubble sort into the FSM so that it will sort data in RAM and display the sorted values.
