                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common struggle of ours, our peers, and many workers is not having complete control of our workplace&rsquo;s surroundings, that be at home, or at work. This made us want to create a simple yet elegant system that allowed people to monitor all aspects of their surroundings at their workplace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads input from a variety of sensors plugged into a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c micro-computer. The microcomputer implements Internet of Things by recording the sensor input into the cloud using a Firebase database. The data is then parsed by a web application that streamlines the data into notifications and an easy to digest GUI. Some of the sensors we used include were input from a light, temperature, sound, a button, and a camera. The camera detects faces using machine learning and notifies the user when a face is detected. The other sensors simply show as statuses on the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented facial detection on the webcamera using the OpenCV library and haar cascades as a data set. The sensors consisted of digikey parts connected to a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c microcomputer. We implemented Firebase with its respective library and updating the database with data from the sensors. Data from the sensors was collected and sent to the database through the microcomputer. The web app was built with javascript and HTML/CSS for the GUI design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were figuring out how to detect faces, which we then turned to Haar Cascades. We also had issues implementing firebase, which we had previously not worked with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to create an IOT device that was functional and unique. We are also proud of being able to figure out how to maintain a database by inputting and parsing information, which was new to all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Firebase and to manage databases. We also learned how to implement facial recognition with Haar Cascades. Additionally, we learned how to make IOT networks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WorkStation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue trying to implement more sensors such as the ultrasonic sensor in order to give the user an even more complete experience. Additionally, we will improve upon the user interface to make it more user-friendly. We will also try to make a real domain for the app.
