                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday we use the internet we leave an online footprint. These footprints can be in the form of posts, comments, submissions, etc. It might be hard to find what exactly you have left behind on the internet and some of these footprints can be very detrimental.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KnowYourPresence.com scans your online presence though social media posts and analyses them for sentiment. If you want to see how your posts would be seen in the eyes of potential employer, the app can tell you! Using the iCIMS Halloween API, KYP compares your posts to other job applicants of a company. We analyze the sentiment of the accepted and denied applicants so we can then compare it to yours. After you're done you can come back to the site later and compare your old sentiment analysis to your new one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KYP was built with Python back-end connected to flask. We used the iCIMS API to store job interests, user details, and past applicants of a company. More information is stored on a sqlite3 server containing detailed score history and related social media accounts. Some of the sentiment is generated using the AWS sentiment analysis API and other parts are done locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the front end to run asynchronous alongside the incoming tweets was really difficult. We overcame it though socket connections between the back-end python and the front-end JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an advanced analysis app that can analyze new data and connect it to previously submitted data to create a detailed report.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about asynchronous programming and the iCIMs API. But more importantly we learned how to manage such a extensive project in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KnowYourPresence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we want to fine-tune the asynchronous behavior and add more social media sources. Additionally, we would want to check your tweets to see if they are about current news events.
