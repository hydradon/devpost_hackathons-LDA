                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving interactions that we saw in existing games and we thought could be improved.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Objects that can be interacted with are very evident (eg in Assassin's Creed), they blink or glow, and it takes away all the fun and mystery behind finding out that you can actually collect them or interact with them.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you need to find hidden marks or text in objects, nowadays games (eg Tomb Raider) assume you've found the hidden part as long as it has been rendered for 1 second on the screen. You may have not realised there was a hidden mark or text, yet they spoiled / revealed for you &ndash; it sucks.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Manipulating / rotating objects is usually done with a joystick &ndash; it's not as fun or immersive as manipulating them using gestures in the air or on a companion device.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Provides new ways of interacting with a game by including an eye tracker and an auxiliary screen. The eye tracker lets you interact and inspect objects in the game just by looking at them and the auxiliary screen serves as a way to avoid clutter in the main screen, improving the user experience.

                        Initially using LeapMotion to capture movement but discarding it due to its imprecision.

                        We had never used EyeX or eyetracking technologies before.
