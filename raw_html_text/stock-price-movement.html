                    Predicts the probability of the stock moving up or down.
Data has been scraped for 500 days. For each day: opening price, day maximum price, minimum price, closing price, trading volume is present.
Prediction: The probability of stock movement for day 10 given trend for last 9 days. Prediction in the range of 0 to 1; where 1 is stock will surely move up.
