                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The temperature of the lecture halls and labs in NYUAD is controlled from a central station on campus and they are often very cold or warm. I built the network of weather stations to give students the opportunity to know the temperature of the classrooms they would be visiting to aid them to decide the kind of clothing to wear for class. In addition to improving people's thermal comfort, large-scale sensor deployment will enable better collection of information about the HVAC system, which will help prevent waste of electricity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current prototype reads the temperature and humidity of the classrooms with a temperature and humidity sensor, connected to the affordable Raspberry Zero board and sends the values in degrees Celcius to a ploty account. This ploty graph is embedded into the website (

                    </a>
                    ). In the future, we can plot temperatures from a massively spread network onto the layout of the campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I connected a Humidity and Temperature Sensor Breakout (
                    <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/12064" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/12064
                    </a>
                    ) to a raspberry pi via I^2C communication. I then read the values of the sensor and sent them to a ploty account. I then embedded a div of the graph file into the website(
                    <a href="https://princesannor.github.io/Indoor-weather-station/" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I used a raspberry pi and I'm proud I was able to sync the I^2 communication of the breakout board after about eight failed attempts.
My python and Linux command line knowledge is very rusty and I'm also glad I was able to understand the library for the breakout board and use it.
I built a simple working website to display the temperature of the lab to my friends and the NYUAD community at wide. Nothing makes me prouder!

                    What's next for Indoor Weather Station
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The classrooms in NYUAD have AV systems. We intend to interface the Indoor Weather Station with the computer system in each classroom and take advantage of the functioning systems to run the Weather Station.

                    NYU and Community Impact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students and faculty with different temperature preferences use the classrooms and this makes it difficult to set a standard temperature that would suit everyone. With the Indoor Weather Station, students and faculty with different temperature preferences can prepare themselves with real-time temperature data of the classrooms they would be visiting. They can put on a jacket, or wear something light if it's supposed to be warm...
