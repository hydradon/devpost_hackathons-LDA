                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the opening ceremony, me and my group went to the local BurritoBoyz. Then suddenly, inspiration struck, like a bolt of lightning to the chest. I thought to myself "growth can be hard, but it doesn't have to". That is how the idea for MyMLM was born.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyMLM is a user-first social media platform designed for business people, investors, and aspiring entrepreneurs alike. It gives exposure new, innovative, budding business ideas by showing them to other MyMLM users, who can chose to invest in the idea. This allows even the everyday person to contribute to the future of businesses.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the python flask microframework in the backend, and we used html and bootstrap css, as well as a bit of javascript in the frontend. We also used sqlalchemy to store user, post, and message data.
