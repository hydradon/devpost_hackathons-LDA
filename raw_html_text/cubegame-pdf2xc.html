                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were seamlessly able to combine every genre of game, allowing for a completely immersive experience that shocks every step of the way leaving users flabbergasted and begging for more.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the limitless potential of the human mind, whilst also getting a deep insight to the troubles that have plagued us since the dawn of man, causing stunts in humanities growth and evolution despite the endless possibilities laid before us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CubeGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be adding a new type of cube but with a twist. This new revolutionary cube will not be 6 sided but instead, one allowing for a singular face that will stare into your soul, furthermore this cube will be curved one could even say spherical allowing for a whole heap of new possibilities not only for cubeGame but for mankind itself.
