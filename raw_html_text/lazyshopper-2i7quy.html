                    We used the Tesco API to search and suggest relevant items to people using sorting algorithms. This allows users to sort their items by price and nutritional content such as Calories, Protein, Fat or Sugar.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are dependent on Tesco's website, we faced problems when we realised we couldn't log into an account programmatically. We also encountered problems when trying to connect the front and back-ends.

                    Our continued belief in the project even though everything was telling us to switch tactics.

                <p>
                    [Hichame] Using the networking feature of a browser to see the types of requests and content being sent.
[Hichame] [Tolu ] Using the Tesco API.
[All of us] Working on a tech project with complete strangers.
[Chining] How to make a website from scratch
[Eleni] My first hackathon was a great experience. My team help me to understand deeper the algorithmic thinking since I am beginner with programming. Also, I get familiar with languages that I have never worked with before.

                    Tracking the user over period of time in order to predict their future shopping habits. (The initial plan was to) Automate grocery shopping by allowing the user to select their favourite/common items (such as milk or chocolate). Create a spotify type page where users can just click a button and have recipe or mood based meals such such as "Comfort Food" or "Mexican Night".
