                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a flask app and utilized the Twilio API to create a call center and would gather and recognize callers' speech and provide an appropriate response based on the request of the caller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out which APIs we wanted to work with and then implementing them together. It was a trial and error process. Another challenge we had was to create a directed graph that would cause callers to go into an infinite loop with our helpful service.

                <p>
                    Learned more about the twilio API and twiml verbs in order to create an interactive environment with the callers.
