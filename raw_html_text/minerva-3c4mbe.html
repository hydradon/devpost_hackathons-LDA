                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my first week at my first internship, I was told to learn react. Having never heard of react before, I was lost and looked for guidance. I thought it would be wonderful, if my manager, a react guru, could just send over some notes that helped him learn react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are able to write notes on our own online text editor, post the note in a public news feed, give feedback to other notes by upvoting quality notes and downvoting subpar notes, and most importantly browse notes of different categories for free!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the server with node.js, express and connected it to a MongoDB cluster as our database to store information. We then created the client side with React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of user interface issues at the client side, problems with connecting the client side and the server side, and not enough time to implement all the features we wanted to include
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working server, and a beautiful client side
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Karming went from a strictly html/css wizard, to a React guru.
Curtis learned how to harness the power of mongodb, and connect it with the server side, and created an online functional text editor with draft.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Minerva
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to develop it as a side project, in the hopes of replacing stack overflow and other knowledge related platforms.
