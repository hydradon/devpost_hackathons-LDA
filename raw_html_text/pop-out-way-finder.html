                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wayfinding is most of the time an issue that people struggle with it in the public areas. There are so many students getting late for their classes and meetings, finding their way in a large campus. Airport, on the other hand, can be a good example that passengers find the right direction in a short amount of time. So a proper compare can shed a light on faults and mistakes. 
I am getting my Certificate in Health System and Design, so paying attention to the best response to disabilities and their problems are part of my daily concern. 
Imagine how all the issues associated with paths and signs could be a bigger difficulty for people with low vision and vision loss. This project is focusing on finding a better solution for these people. A person without disabilities can easily use a map, but a person with vision impairment should find his way with so many trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this challenge, I was thinking that these people should have their own map!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a mechanical board with a size of a normal tablet. It includes many small cubes, 1/64" by 1/64". This board is connected to a cell phone and run by an app. When a subject comes to a specific location, the app can get the location and send the right info to the board. The small cubes will pop out showing the place of buildings. It can be considered as the 3rd map with all the buildings projected up.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be built with an electronic board using mechanical cubes.

                <p>
                    I am wondering how easier these cubes can work.

                    It feels great to make something that makes people's life easier.

                <p>
                    I learned that every step that we take, can be an initiation. We never get enough of it.

                <p>
                    A zoom-in capability sounds necessary. So in the upgrade version, I am looking for even bigger scaled map including stairs, ramp, or any uneven ground.
