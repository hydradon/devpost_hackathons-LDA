                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one enjoys waiting in lines or wasting time. We wanted to make it easier for people to avoid lines and spend time doing what really matters.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to search restaurants and other businesses and view the wait times. Then, users can make informed decisions about how to spend their time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an iOS app in Swift that is the user interface for the app. In it, users are able to search for businesses and view information about the queue. On the backend, we implemented a Google Cloud SQL database to hold the users' spots in lines. We also used Python through the App Engine to interact with the Cloud SQL database to calculate wait times and display information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we faced were interacting with our Cloud SQL database both through the iOS app side and through the App Engine to calculate useful information.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much we learned and grew as a team this past night. We faced many challenges and worked through them with positive attitudes and tried our best to set our idea to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage databases with Google Cloud tools and how to link different parts of an app together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Q
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Q are finishing the integration of the iOS app with the Cloud SQL database and to flesh out the web app.
