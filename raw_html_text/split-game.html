                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the thought of moving a ball and changing its velocity by  splitting into two masses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's  an IOS game where in order to read a destination you must use your understanding of physics to move a ball based on momentum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    some issues we ran into are: buttons not showing up in the right place on unity, designing and implementing scripts to split the ball and change its velocity and mass.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned about ios development and the challenges associated with using unity.
                </p>

                    What's next for Split-Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we want to implement more features such as controlling chunks of mass that were
