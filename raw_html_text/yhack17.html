                    Description
The web application helps the students to monitor his finances and suggests consumer destinations based on the spending habits of the fellow university students. This app is implemented by integrating "Plaid" financial app, which based on the user's banking transactions produces various categories and sub-categories of spending(i.e Food and Travel, Shopping etc) and provides the app with details like money spent, time and location, the shopping outlets etc.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It produces the app's user with best cost-effective consumer outlets if his spending is above the average spending of fellow students in the respective departments of spending. For example, if the user's spending on shopping is way over the average spending of his fellow students at his university, the app will suggest the top locations which are the student's go-to areas in his locality and has less spending range. The spending of the user and average spending of users is displayed using histograms.
