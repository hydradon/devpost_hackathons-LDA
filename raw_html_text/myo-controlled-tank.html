                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo wristband is a wonderful product, allowing a really dynamic range of gestures to be picked up. Using this fact and a convenient API, we created (or programmed, rather) a robot tank that is controlled by Myo gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moves around, allows for someone either incapable of using a remote control or someone who just hates it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Myo API for python, python sent UDP packets via a local network we set up, which transmits the packets to an Arduino with WiFi shield that controls the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino WiFi dongle is archaic so many trials and tribulations came with that and other hardware/software issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work! Each interface was a unique accomplishment on its own though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about APIs and how easy python is to do otherwise obnoxious stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myo Controlled Tank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cameras streaming, more sensors, more power and speed. Although the tank itself is Raytheon's.
