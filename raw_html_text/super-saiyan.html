                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make something Dragonball related as the finale was the same day as the hackathon. We wanted to make something related to transoformation of power levels lke Goku in a fun way. We decided we wanted to act like Super Saiyans ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, you can transform througb 5 different forms (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2 and 3, Super Saiyan God, and Super Saiyan blue by. . . Yelling into the mic! If you scream louder and hold, you will reach your transformation, and different transformations have cool effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java, specifically using the Swing API for our GUI and Maven to handle dependencies and form our jar file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challengers were how to detect loudness of the microphone, playing gifs in a JFrame, and creating some settings for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we're able to successfully play gifs and we met our goal of having 5 different transformations with some effects like playng music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned extensively how to tap into catching microphone activity, JFrame, JPanel JButton etc... and how to be a Super Saiyan!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Saiyan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make effects and transitions pop out more with cooler transitions. We also hope to make a Versus mode by scoring how well someone maintains a transformation so people can compete on who can yell the loudest and longest!
