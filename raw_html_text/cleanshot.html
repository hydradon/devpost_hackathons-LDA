                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a roomba with local vision processing for real time targeting

                    Shoot nerf darts at all who cross it's path

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the Kinect to the Raspberry Pi, and started getting them to work together.
This involved setting up and installing various libraries and firmwares, and some source compilation
to get some of the older more outdated libraries to work. Then we started getting vision processing to work on the Pi, and getting a skeleton from the Kinect. This involved further more library searching, compilation, and testing. In the meanwhile, we also had to develop a mount and firing mechanism for the Nerf gun. This required multiple 3d printed parts to be designed and printed, as well as some modification to the body of the Nerf gun. We also had to find ways for C and Python to communicate data from one to the other in a manner they both understood.

                    3d Printing

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a lot of discontinuous libraries communicate and send each other information, and use said information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kinect is an older piece of hardware, and has outdated libraries to match. Getting old libraries to work takes a lot of leg work.
