                </h2>
                <p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the amazon Alexa skills kit, amazon web services, and dynamo DB to interface our logic with the echo. We interfaced the forecast.io API to get weather info to interface in our javascript files.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing the forecast API with javascript and reading the responses was the most difficult part.
                </p>
