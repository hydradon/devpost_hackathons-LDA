                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple way for people to stay involved in politics and felt that being lazy or "having no time" wasn't a good enough excuse.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AccountaBunny prompts you every day to see if you have some time to make an impact. Depending on how long you are free, it will suggest an action (make a phone call, send an email) based on the issue you choose to tackle that day. In addition, you can add a custom call to action (organizing a local march) and that event will be sent to people near you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Microsoft's chat box client in Node.js. We used a MySQL database with Azure.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Setting up Azure, running into internal server errors, and deprecated API's.
