                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to come up with a solution for reducing the carbon footprint. It has been our passion to work towards a sustainable future. The only way to bring about such a change would through bring the community together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution brings people together to start their own mini-projects to reduce carbon footprint, reuse waste and spend non-renewable resources mindfully. The unique aspect of our platform is that, we hope as people will be able to fork others projects and work on them, **it would help in starting off chain reactions **of deeds that will have a greater impact on the society we live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server runs on Node JS and uses MongoDB to store user authentication and project attributes. Currently, the front end is served with the help of EJS templates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first time, we had trouble starting. However, we were passionate about our idea and we kept ploughing through. We could not complete the build but we have a working model and wireframes which we plan to develop in the next month.
                </p>
