                    3 freshman came up with an idea to help free up some 911 operator lines. Simple as that! We want to help users who are involved in an emergent situation. We gained inspiration from the failure of Siri and the idea that we wanted to teach users appropriate manors in dire situations. We came up with 20 ideas and narrowed it down to one option that we thought well represented our group values. Next to come... an app that instantly connects you to 911 (maybe sophomore year lol).
