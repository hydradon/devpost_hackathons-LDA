                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this technology revolved around the ever developing society we live in. We as a community grow and so does our medical advances, however first respondents and emergency workers have been forced to work with out dated techniques and little information when they first arrive on scene. That is where Facing Facts comes into effect. Facing Facts will allow first respondents to know more information about individuals that they would normally be unable to see. Our goal is to enable first respondents to better assist individuals with special medical needs, especially ones with no visible symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facing Facts' end plan is to be on both iOS and Android, and will use a closed circuit network to securely relay information quickly. The information it will be relaying contains things like if the victim of an incident may be a hemophiliac, autistic, or some other non-visible illness or handicap that may require additional assistance during the emergency process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the Gui system tkinter I developed an interface that allows first respondents to log into the secure circuit before being able to scan the individuals. Scanning the individuals was through the use of open source cv. Using OpenCv I was able to connect to the video feed of my computer and then narrow down the face of the individuals from the photo. I also used Google Docs to create a basic form for individuals to respond to, for the information that would be put into the database for reference during the facial recognition process providing the information for the first respondents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I struggled a lot with the implementation of opencv into the code as well as getting my own computer camera to operate with me. Having a computer camera that often times does not function properly caused a majority of problems when it came to testing the video section of the coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how far the program came together while I was the only one who was working on it and I'm excited to continue this program forwards to potentially assist first respondents and the families of those who may not always get the help they need during emergency situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with opencv as well as the integration of video feed into Gui systems to allow the facial recognition processes to collect the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facing Facts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From here Facing Facts intends to continue development into a phone or hand-held device application as well as a continuation of development and building of the database that facing facts calls upon for the information provided for first respondents. The goal is for Facing Facts to eventually be able to be on the front lines to do its part to help save lives or ensure the safety of those whose struggles aren't always obvious to the naked-eye.
