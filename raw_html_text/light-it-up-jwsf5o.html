                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to experiment with hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a terminal game that iluminates the keys of the keyboard, and you have to press them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Logitech SDK with c++ in Visual Studio.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never worked with hardware before, so it was a lot of fun to make a game with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our C++ coding skills, learned how to use Visual Studio and key events of C++.
                </p>

                    What's next for Light it up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An improvement could be make it an online game, where you can challenge your friends!
