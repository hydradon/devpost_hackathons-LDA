                    A project that takes input in the form of an Atbash cipher, ROT13 cipher, Caesar cipher, Simple Substitution cipher, Polybius Square cipher, Baconian cipher, or an Affine cipher
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this project by our interest in computer science and the cybersecurity, encryption, and decryption of ciphers. We like to solve problems from scratch, which decrypting ciphers helps us to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a significant amount about ciphers and the encryption and decryption process of a multitude of ciphers. We were also able to hone in on our basic Java and arithmetic skills throughout this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built this using modular coding, in which we each worked on our own cipher, and we divided up the workload amongst ourselves evenly, working on different ciphers and encryption and decryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges during the arithmetic and formula production processes, as well as understanding how to incorporate these ciphers into Java code. We also had trouble presenting our ciphers on a GUI that was creative and self-made, due to time and resource restraints, so we had to resort on integrated GUI such as JOptionPane.
