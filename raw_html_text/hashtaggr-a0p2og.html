                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been boggled by all the clutter of news on the Internet. So we've been looking to find a way to help people become better informed on current events, based on the topic of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls news data from various news sources via a hashtag input and produces all relevant results to that hashtag. It also informs the user of how positive or negative people are reacting to that topic on the Internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used basic web development structure for our groundwork, with Angular 5 as a framework. Python was used as a back-end to produce the functionality that processes raw data into meaningful visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to solve merge conflicts, since we had time constraints and had to rely on each other to fulfill overlapping responsibilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to put together a non-trivial application in the span of 24 hours and making it work as expected. It also looks really nice :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different tools like Flask and integrating Python into a web development back-end. Also, that the news can be very interesting sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hashtaggr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to clean up some of the code using well-established software engineering principles and explore new features to implement, like additional ways to visualize the data.
