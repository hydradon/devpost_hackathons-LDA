                    We came to Los Altos Hacks with no idea about what to create. We decided to attend the website workshop, where we learned a bit of html5 and css. After the workshop, we decided to continue on one of the websites. The website is about wholesome memes. It is dedicated to a friend of ours, named Samantha, who runs a wholesome memes Instagram page. The goal of our website is to make people feel loved and make their day at least a little bit better. We wanted to integrate Snapchat's Snap Kit because we felt that Bitmojis would be a fun addition. Also, neither of us have ever done something like this before, so it was a great learning opportunity for the both of us.
