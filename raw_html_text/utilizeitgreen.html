                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have stuff in our storage that we actually do not use and has been laying there for ages. Some of that we are thinking of selling but recall it at the wrong time of the year or we have stuff that "we might need some day". To help you to remember what you are storaging and to remind you of letting go of stuff we created UtilizeITGreen.

                <p>
                    Our solution let's you track items in your storage space and its condition.

                        How
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add new items by scanning them with your camera (ML behind the scene)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        manually check items in your storage space
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        monitor the storage room conditions: temperature, humidity, air quality
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        You get notifications on items you don't use and it reminds you then to sell or donate them (eg. item is not used for 1 year, or if you want to sell your prom dress, you will get notification at the best time to sell it before the event)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        get notifications on storage room condition changes (eg. humidity too high)
                    </li>

                    Out team build the project with love, passion and bravery. We divided the responsibilities between group members so that everyone had his/her own part. The project was build with Angular, Node.js and Firebase's Firestore.
