                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're CS majors... we don't get out much. FitBit? Smart watches? Not motivation enough. Tamagotchi had it right.
                    <strong>
                        We needed cats.
                    </strong>
                    We walked into this hackathon with one goal: learn and have fun. (Ok, maybe it was two goals). What had we never done before? What did we want to learn about? After eating a lot of junk food and reevaluating our life choices, we realized that this game would probably be very relevant and useful, along with it being fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cash in your hard-earned daily steps into precious PawPoints. Use these to buy food and toys for your cat and take it on walks. If your cat just enjoyed a delicious meal of cat food, you can pat yourself on the back, because not only are you a great pet owner, you walked 1000 steps, and
                    <strong>
                        you're healthy.
                    </strong>
                    If your cat's health bars are low and it keels over from exhaustion and sadness, you're overwhelmed with the desire to do better. To
                    <strong>
                        be healthy for your cat.
                    </strong>
                    Basically, if you move around and stay fit, your cat is happy and loves you. If not... it'll let you know it's unhappy. Just like any real cat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With React-Native and Javascript/JSX and a little touch of Xcode on the side. We integrated HealthKit to convert your stepcount into in-game currency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience with React-Native, mobile development, or JSX, so most of the last 24 hours we spent learning everything from scratch. (AKA we spent maybe four hours trying to get an image to be a button that navigates to the next scene.) That's fine, though. It made our accomplishments feel even better and more rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game!!!! #CatsRepresent #HealthCat
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is great. Sleep is optional. Hackathons are 10% luck (why is this working), 20% skill (I know why this isn't working), 15% concentrated power of will (I will make this start working), 5% pleasure (holy crap this is working), 50% pain (why can't stackoverflow just make it start working), and 100% reason to remember CAGIF!!!
