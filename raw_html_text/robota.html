                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past, one of us helped do research and used to work very closely with special needs children as a volunteer teaching assistant. During the research, I found many studies that showed that special needs students actually worked better in environments interacting with robots because they recognized that robots were judgement-free and students were less likely to be embarrassed or afraid of being disappointing. As a teaching assistant, I often times had to work with students on an individual basis but I would have loved to know if another student needed my attention. And thus, the idea for robota was born.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So robota acts as a ideal teaching assistant for special needs classrooms by 
Step 1) roams classroom until it recognizes frustration in a student
                    <br>
                    Step 2) prompts frustrated student for an explanation 
Step 3) completes tone &amp; sentiment analysis on student&rsquo;s response
                    <br>
                    Step 4) sends analysis if necessary to teacher/parent

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Autonomous TurtleBot2 to take pictures of its surroundings and detect a frustrated student. It then uses a python script to play audio and record the student speaking. We then use an IBM-Watson speech to text API to transcribe the audio, and pass the information to our pubnub block and do sentiment analysis to notify the teacher/parent using Nexmo.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time figuring out how to use PubNub especially when their APIs involving Clarifai were very outdated. Also, utilizing the custom Clarifai image models were challenging.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first times using a robot, computer vision, and machine learning at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to write a python script, use custom image modeling through Clarifai, and use Autonomous' turtlebot.
                </p>

                    What's next for robota
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holding fully developed conversations with students
Improving facial analysis and learning how to handle situation instead of just reporting to parent/teacher.
