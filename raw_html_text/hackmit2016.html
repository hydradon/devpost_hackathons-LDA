                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the Loci method in psychology class and found it interesting and having great potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app creates and takes one through a virtual mind palace, where one can place visual representations of topics at familiar locations. Afterwards, one can play a game to test one's familiarity with your subject of memorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build and program this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often had issues with Github when pushing/pulling/merging. In addition, android programming was new to a few of our team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app successfully combines the creation of a mind palace with an interactive test of the user's progress in memorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new programming techniques, as well as how to divide the programming tasks to maximize efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would like to extend the project to customize the mind palace for the users.
