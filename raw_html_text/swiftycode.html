                    I wanted to be able to utilize Apples iOS 10's new iMessage App features. With this is mind, I wanted to create something that allowed people to share code quickly with one another on mobile.

                    <strong>
                        By using SwiftyCode, you will be able to select between multiple programming languages (Swift support only as of now), and have the most common syntax prototypes right at your fingertips. With just a tap of a button, users are able to have editable prototypes that can be shared with others.

                    <strong>
                        Utilzing Apple's newest release of Swift, I was able to create the iMessage extension. The most difficult part was dealing with text formatting changes when the user edits the text or adds more to the editor. Its been a while since I finished an app at a hackathon. Being able to have a fully functional app by the end of the hackathon is great.

                        What did I learn? Well, I learned a lot about auto layout and how to apply it. I also learned even more abou Swift and specifically Swift 3.0

                    <strong>
                        SwiftyCode will eventually support more programming languages more than Swift and allow for the receiver to parse the received image and edit the code and send it back
