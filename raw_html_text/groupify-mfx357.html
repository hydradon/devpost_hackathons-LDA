                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all been in situations where group work was inevitable. More often than not these groups would be completely randomly assigned by your teacher/professor/employer, and you find you are in a team of complete strangers. The biggest problem that plagues the team is often meet ups. Lining up schedules, accommodating for everyone's time, and coordinating meet ups outside of class is a common problem that is the beginning of a team's downfall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to address this issue and create something that would alleviate the stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Groupify takes the schedules submitted by students where they state the days and times during a week where they are free. The program will then take the free times submitted and group students depending on how often they need to meet, and how long the group is required to meet up for the project. Similar to a calendar merger, but it will only display overlapping availabilities and not a student's full personal schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hope is that teacher/professor/employer will be able to use it to create groups with the highest work potential using this program.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ exclusively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we aren't proficient in C++ yet, we were a few steps behind the goal of our project.
We ran into some trouble with creating code that would compare the schedules to find the availability parallels in C++, especially if more than a few students need to be entered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use concepts learned in our classes to bring the project to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot more to a well-made app than the code, and in future hackathons we would like to have something closer to that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Groupify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning a few more skills, this program could become a full application which students, teachers, and employers alike can use to create groups. The user interface would be simple but effective. Students would be able to directly submit their schedules to app without need of a teacher, and groups would be efficiently created.
