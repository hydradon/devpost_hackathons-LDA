                    ISSUE ADDRESSED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spontaneous ideas, often the best moments of genius, are not acted on due to the difficulty of recruiting like-minded people to collaborate with. People often stay within their own social circles in pitching ideas, which often limits the diversity in skill assets. We don&rsquo;t want to see these ideas remain complacent. Our solution is to provide a platform where users both pitch and peruse ideas, therefore ideas will not remain in the private domain of one. Users are able to then further refine the idea through other user&rsquo;s feedback and communication. This website aims to serve everyone: business owners, web developers, app creators, students. Age should also not be a limiting factor as children often have the most brilliant ideas.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, Shuge was eating at a chipotle restaurant thinking about miscellaneous things. A brilliant idea came up but she had no writing utensil nor my phone. So she carved my idea onto the napkin with my keys. But even though that idea was captured, it was never acted upon. We wanted to solve the issue of pushing forward uncapitalized ideas. We chose napkins as a physical representation of ideas scribbled down. The web app process should be as simple as scribbling down your idea onto a napkin. The color orange was chosen as it is a color of youth, vigor and innovation. A light color scheme and material design principles were followed throughout.

                    <li>
                        Upload and draft out ideas: the text editor should be fairly adept (think Medium) &rarr; ideas could range from as raw as one sentence or a fully blown out plan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ideas/projects will be have their own individualized project page where people can post a timeline, updates, discussion board (think kickstarter). This space presents the ideator to more effectively pitch their idea.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the user prefers to stay anonymous and not make an account and just purely contribute the idea, that is also an option. However, these untethered ideas will probably be harder to actualize
Similar to craigslist, if an idea/project has not been touched upon for a long time, it will be archived and brought back periodically to test for its efficacy.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Map view: You can see what are the ideas surrounding you especially if certain ideas are geographically based (eg. let&rsquo;s host an awareness event for XYZ in _______)

                    Napkim provides a platform for ideators to share their thoughts, such as post-shower-eureka moments and spur-of-the-moment geniuses, onto a public database where anyone could peruse and gain inspiration from. Utilizing an upvote system similar to reddit and kickstarter, projects with the most support will be pushed to the top of the list and gain more exposure. Meanwhile, there will be both a list and visual view of the ideas. Ideas could filtered out with various categories, such as time committment, location, money constraints, type...ect Once the website user finds an idea that they fancy pursuing, they will be able to directly contact the author and create further changes.
