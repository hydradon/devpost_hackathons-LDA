                    Our team created a project to fulfill the challenge presented by Teach For America. We tried creating a seating arrangement based on the class&rsquo; academic performance and physical disability requirements. This project serves to help the teachers to provide better learning experience to students and to help all those that require help.

                    We gave the priority of seating for disabled students. We placed them in the front rows based on the teacher&rsquo;s choice. Students with temporary injuries were placed on the aisle seats for easier movement. Students who could not see or hear properly were placed at the front. Empty spots were reserved for students who could only move with the help of a wheelchair.

                    The next priority was given for students with academic difficulties. As students who are facing difficulty require more attention, they are placed directly close to the teacher. They are placed in the front rows as much as possible. Students who could perform better than those with difficulties were placed towards the middle and then the end along with the high achievers of the class.

                    We faced time challenges, which restricted in exploring more possibilities in the seating arrangement. We were all first-time hackers, so trying to do an assignment in a short time was a huge challenge. And trying to master Swift, in less than a day, made the task even more challenging. But in this process, we learned to manage our resources, find the right help and manage crisis during dire situations.
