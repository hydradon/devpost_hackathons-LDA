                    We are constantly covering our friends costs at restaurants, movies, shopping etc. Splitting bills isn't easy, and sometimes friends forget to pay you back! We get frustrated over these nuisances, and we know other people do, too.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This website can split bills, convert you currency, calculate tax and tip, and record money that you owe.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used MongoDB to store the user's information and inputs, and Meteor.JS for communication between frontend and backend.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced include saving input in an account, such as money your friends owe. Signing in with Facebook was also never achievable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Creating a working prototype that saves user information, including email and password. We worked well together and all had different skill sets, so we helped each other out!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Hackathons are an amazing way to learn to use new databases, clouds, and software. We became better at managing time and explaining concepts to people who have never come in contact with them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Keepin Tabs: We hope to "Keep" this project to refer to in the future as an example of something useful in the real world. We probably won't be able to expand, but our experiences from this hackathon will help us in all of our very different paths.
