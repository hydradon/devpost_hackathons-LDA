                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary inspiration for this project was the struggles that we saw several of our local communities faced. Often, they faced the dilemma of deciding whether certain products were recyclable or not recyclable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both the website and the application can detect whether an item is recyclable or not using advanced image recognition algorithms and directs the user to close by recycling centers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the website, we used html, css, and javascript. For the application, we used the android studio, java, python, and clarifai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we primarily depending on advanced image recognition for the majority of our application, we often ran into issues where our model somewhat failed to accurately detect the object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of the fact that we were able to successfully incorporate image recognition into our website and mobile application. We are also proud of how we were able to take such a hard challenge and split into several smaller pieces that were easier to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about machine learning, image recognition, and computer vision. We were able to attain a higher level of understanding about these algorithms and their different applications. We also learned to work together as a team and chase one common goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartCycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aspire to make our image recognition algorithm more accurate as we continue our pursuit in machine learning for computer vision and mobile application development. We have plans to release our application in the app store and possible create a company together.
