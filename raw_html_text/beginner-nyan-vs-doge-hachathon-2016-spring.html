                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nyan vs Doge draws inspiration from the game bomberman. It combines two of our most favorite memes into an improved version of a classical game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game allows two players to play against one another (i.e nyan cat vs doge) with mechanism similar to that of the (in)famous bomberman.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used objectdraw to create the game with Java, using arrays to represent the field and player/obstacle/bomb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we use objectdraw library, we have very limited options. We have to resolve problems on a very conceptual level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to figure out the proper algorithm of the game and add a cute special effect of the bombing! Also improve the graphics rendered by photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coding with Java is exceptionally hard but user friendly and requires a decent amount of logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to create an improved version of our game. (i.e: updating bomb upgrades and all the cool stuffs)!
