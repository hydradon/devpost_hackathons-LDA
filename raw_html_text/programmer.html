                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to spread awareness about human trafficking and open the eyes of the public to the victims of sexual exploitation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is an interactive and engaging place where people can share their experiences, learn about human trafficking, and have resources to prevent human exploitation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to build the website because our team had very little knowledge of HTML coding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We were able to build a fully functional website.
