                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all enjoy our time down at the CAFE in wads and wanted to make a type of comedic and fun take on the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    its a type of game that works much like cooking mama and Overcooked where you gather ingredients and create dishes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    starting in unity we custom built scripts and even assets and sprites. We all had different backgrounds in visuals or programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was really just learning how to use the program itself. We wanted to take advantage of the time and space we had in the Hackathon to be able to learn about something that slightly differed from our majors but still involved some type of software development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We honestly were super proud of developing some core game-play features which included some types of movement, inventory systems, and collision mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working as a team especially because Unity has a built in cloud service that allows for easy updates to the cloud and easily downloadable to other members of the group.
