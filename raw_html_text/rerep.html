                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time I meet someone new, and hear "Oh! I've heard of you!" I wonder exactly what they've heard of me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's the ultimate correlation app. The idea behind ReRep is simple: do you associate x(your friend), with y(the hashtag)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    ReRep was named in the grand old tradition of smashing two words together, in this case "Real" and "Reputation," because that's what ReRep gives the user: their real reputation, an anonymous summary of what others think of you, and how you think of others-whether they be your friends, coworkers, or classmates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's the social media aspect. But in some senses, you could consider ReRep a data collection app masquerading as a social media app. The really technically interesting thing about RealRep is the way correlations between different hashtags appear. And that's some really cool data. For example-is there a correlation between users who are associated with #gamer and #nintendo? (Signs point to yes, btw)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built ReRep using javascript, node.js, dynamodb, aws, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. Pretty common for a web app-except for dynamodb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our challenges ended up happening in what might be considered the more technically easier part of the project; i.e. when my teammates and I were creating the UI. There was a suprising amount of hurdles associated with the data presentation -we had large amounts of user-generated data that we were trying to present in a social-media friendly format. There were numerous issues associated with trying to stick the back end and the front end together (which ultimately culminated in scrapping multiple hours of work on the UI), but we were eventually able to get the app up and running in a user-friendly fashion.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a fully functioning app off the ground in 48 hours, and I'm proud of the way we combined the social media and data collection aspects in a novel way. After all, we're basically encouraging people to submit data in a way that is built on love of social media.

                <h2>
                    What's next for ReRep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are still two sets of features that we need to build for ReRep. Most notably, the distinguishing factor between friends and non-friends. Then, adding more statistical data and making it gorgeously intuitive.
