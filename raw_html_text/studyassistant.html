                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our own experiences as students motivated us.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It extracts key terms from an input text file and outputs the key terms, as well as brief descriptions and a related video for each term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With SpaCy, we extracted the key terms using its entity recognition ability. Then, we scraped google search results using BeautifulSoup4.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to train our own NER model, but it proved too complex to complete in the time we had. Thus, we opted to use SpaCy's NER model/feature instead.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete our project and create a user interface on a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to scrape HTML docs in Python, which definitely boosted my skills and challenged my ability to code.
                </p>

                    What's next for StudyAssistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Train its own NER model specifically using academic texts, and use NLP to write notes based on the input text file.
