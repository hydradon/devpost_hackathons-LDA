                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this website is the love for dogs and the desire to bring rescue to them. We were also inspired by how Pokemon Go brought people out of their houses and were able to interact with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's meant to allow users to login and apply to be able to walk a dog of their choice from shelters with the right amount of permission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mainly HTML to build this website. We also used a free web host that would be able to validate the Login of the users, which meant that PHP was also another main part of our server side part of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first idea was to make a bus tracker application however we were unable to obtain the API from PTV so we ended up changing our project. 
Sharing the invision link.
The web server took a long amount of time to set up which meant we were unable to move forward with the Login/Register.
The register page was unable to communicate with the server hence the reason it doesn't work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our designs, the fact that we had a few functions running
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to connect to a webserver, learnt to think of solutions on the spot, communicate with others and work in a team and trying to incorporate everyone's skills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Walk a Dog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to make it into a mobile application to make it more portable, including the database of dogs from shelters and to include more shelters once we have gained recognition.We would also like to include some security checks to make sure Dog Walkers have a valid dog license before they're able to walk a dog.
