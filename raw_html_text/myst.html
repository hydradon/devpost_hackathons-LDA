                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran out of space on my dropbox and wanted to merge my google drive together with it to have a more uniform storage space with greater capacity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It essentially stores files for you in both drives without you knowing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with python and flask for the backend and html and jinja2 for the frontend.
