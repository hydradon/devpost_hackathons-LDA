                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to expand IFTTT with conditional statements and a more flexible interface which supports chaining multiple events and accessing context of triggers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automate is a webapp for automating tasks which provides three main types of blocks: triggers, conditionals, and events (actions). Much like in IFTTT, triggers check to see if something has occurred - whether it be a new tweet, new entry in an RSS feed, etc. Events perform some action, for example sending a text to a user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But unlike IFTTT, Automate doesn't constrain the user to one trigger and one action; instead, the user can build a flow graph of triggers, conditionals (if statements), and events, making for a much more customizable experience. All events and conditionals can access results of the trigger (for example, the text of the tweet that triggered the chain).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used fabric.js for the editor front end, flask for the web back end, and asyncio for the trigger processor. We used peewee as our ORM to back our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a good way to store block relations in a database was difficult. We had to create a user friendly interface which serialized blocks down into a machine-readable format, which then could be parsed by the backend trigger executor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy with our interactive web interface, and we think our webapp is well designed and clean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do asynchronous processing in Python using asyncio, and how to use fabric.js for interactive interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can very easily add more triggers and events to Automate, because it was designed in a modular fashion.
