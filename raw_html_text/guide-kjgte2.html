                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that not all buildings are accessible for people with disabilities like blind people. So we thought if we could create a software that can guide people to certain areas such as the bathroom, and the entrance it would make peoples lives easier.

                    A Guide is a program that listens to where a person wants to go and then tells them how to get there. We can use this in universities and hotels.
