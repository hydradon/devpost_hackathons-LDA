                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SocialEyes was inspired by recent events around us. Every day millions of people across the world use social media platforms such as Twitter and often post unintentionally offensive content in an impulsive manner. Through our website, we are able to inform users of these offensive tweets to help them clean them up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes in a user's Twitter handle and goes on to analyze it reporting percentages of potentially offensive, likely offensive and neutral content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Python for sentiment analysis and content classification in the backend. We also used materialize.css and HTML, CSS, JS for the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    Properly integrating the front-end and back-end portions with Flask to return information in a timely manner.
