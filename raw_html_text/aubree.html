                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quantum Computing is the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It abstracts programs so that you don't have to program a quantum computer using assemmbly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using  The Scheme programming language (The best language ever! Check it out) I also used IBM quantum Computing API that would send my Quantum Algorithms  to IBM's Quantum Computer without me going to their website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't get my environment function working (ran out of time). So aubree can't evaluate recursive programs. Yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that i got as far as defining quantum gates in aubree. Its is a very big function!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 hours is not enough time to build a compiler for a Quantum Computer from scratch.
                </p>

                    What's next for aubree
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to get aubree to evaluate recursive functions
