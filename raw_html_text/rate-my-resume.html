                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to created an application that would automate a lot of the resume screening process so that hiring managers can spend more time talking to applicants instead of looking at resumes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans a resume and pulls out both hard and soft skills that a person the employer seeks. It then calls the user and asks them behavioral questions in order to judge their interpersonal skills. The speech from the automated behavioral interview is analyzed by an algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app app as a web application. The front-end was built with AngularJS. The NLU algorithm was programmed in Python and incorporating a variety of different publicly available libraries. Our backend was built using MongoDB and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was the learning curve. I personally ha never used python before and it took some time to understand python and develop the NLU algorithm. Nicole's biggest challenge was communicating with the backend. Neel's biggest challenge was working with Twilio and accepting file input.
