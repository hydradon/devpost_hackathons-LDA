                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To aid Toronto police in helping young teens avoid gang activities.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to learn about whatever they want, such as programming, entrepreneurship, music etc. and gives points for lessons and activities they have completed. These points can then be redeemed for real life prizes, such as a free pizza/movie/gift card. At risk youth can also be connected to a mentor, that can not only help with their projects but also be someone they can talk to about anything. Universities/colleges can also look at the points, and progress of the users, and be able to give out scholarships. Users will also be able to compete against their friends, and compare points at the end of each month to become that month's "champion". This will "gamify" education, and make learning fun. Our focus is to create a life long hobby in these youth, and empower them to seek a better future through education.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, and CSS to create the static version of the website. We were able to add a dynamic element by using javascript. Javascript was used to create the points addition, and reduction system. By using local storage we saved the points obtained from the activities, and displayed it in the rewards page. These points can then be deducted if they were spent to buy a pizza/movie/gift card.

                    What's next for Rewardemy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal is expansion. We need to get more mentors, and users using our application. This can be done by creating more topics, and contacting experts in that field to be able to mentor. By expanding, and getting mentors that are skilled in the arts, trades, sciences etc. we will be able to catch the interest of more users, and ultimately create more awareness about our application.
