                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    15 percent of all fatal crashes involve a drowsy driver. What if we could reduce the risk on our roads through a simple-to-use virtual assistant?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the heart rate of the user, RoadsidePal notices when you are getting sleepy, and uses that information to help keep you alert. Whether it be through some fun riddles, playing loud music, or by helping you call a friend, RoadsidePal is the driving partner everyone needs. He can even map you to the nearest hotel or restaurant if you ask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using DialogFlow for the user interface, we made intents and actions to help fill specified purposes. We also programmed a native app for Android Watch which has the ability to call Maps, Open Spotify, Answer questions, and keep the user entertained with over 15 different commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was most difficult to connect RoadsidePal to the app on an actual smartwatch, as the many different updated software versions meant that devices and software were frequently incompatible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of our ability to produce and check skill-testing questions. Also, we are very happy that we were able to make our app fully functional in google maps, Spotify, and alarms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about chatbots and how to make them user-friendly. We also developed our ability to connect apps with little user effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoadsidePal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on further developing RoadsidePal so that instead of relying on your assessment of a resting heart rate, it can analyze it from previously recorded data. Also, we would be interested in expanding the options available to our user.
