                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make this project based on an issue that many companies have of figuring out which vendors to sell to given a limited inventory
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user changes the inventory and enters what their customer list is. The program does the work and decides which customers to sell to in order to make the most money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Pandas and Python in order to go through the data and figure out the ideal customer list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it very difficult to maintain focus throughout a 24 hour period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Python and how to work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inventory Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we can expand this project to have a better front end that is more intuitive and interactive for the user.
