                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always been a struggle to produce coherent, professional, and compelling writing. When I came across the MeaningCloud API, I thought about how useful it would be for editing essays, as a student. And it became an even more important idea when I realized that it could be very powerful for somebody in marketing or politics to edit their speeches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes your document and provides insights about what you're writing. It pops out a sidebar with information about your document, like if it is objective or subjective, if it is ironic, if it is coherent, how you can make it more coherent, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Apps Scripts and G Suite SDK to read the document and create the sidebar. I utilized the MeaningCloud API to run various analyses on the document, and then used the web stack to create the webpage (the graph is build with Chart.js).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to understand the G Suite Marketplace SDK at first, because it has is a new framework, and requires you to work in a special environment you write your code. Additionally, it wasn't easy to construct the API request for MeaningCloud, but once these two obstacles were passed, it was smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm elated that I was able to build this app well, and submit it for publication to the the Chrome Web store and the G Suite Marketplace. It looks like it belongs in Google Docs, and I've had many friends sign up for testing it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about integrating applications together, and how challenging it can be to have the mental overhead of three different architectures at the same time. It was very challenging, but once I put together a framework that handled these three topics well, it was (again) smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love for Concept to become real-time, which isn't the case right now because I don't want to run out of MeaningCloud API credits. Additionally, more insights, and better coherence detection would be a major goal.
