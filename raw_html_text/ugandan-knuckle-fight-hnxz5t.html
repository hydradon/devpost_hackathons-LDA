                            We were inspired by the popular meme of Ugandan Knuckle and his user-created catchphrase, "Do you know da 
wey?" It was also a part of the CTF we took part in this hackathon.

                            What it does
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            It is a two-player game in which each player can control their own Ugandan Knuckle. The Ugandan Knuckles can 
spit, and winning requires hitting the opposition three times.

                            How we built it
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We built this game with the Unity engine, using Visual Studio 2017 for writing scripts in C#.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Challenges we ran into
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            There were many times our team had to backtrack due to minor issues and at one point switched ideas because of &gt;&gt; getting stuck on a particular issue involving a class we were unfamiliar with.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Accomplishments that we're proud of
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            It was our first experience with a game engine, and having essentially finished within the allotted time, that alone was 
accomplishing for us. Constantly looking into the scripting API and identifying necessary elements were crucial.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            What we learned
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We learned that even small projects like this game can take a lot of work and manpower. We have also learned how 
stressful working quickly under a small time-frame can be.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The sequel. But in serious terms, probably more games of this nature for practice, and possibly moving on to much &gt;&gt; more advanced things in the future.
