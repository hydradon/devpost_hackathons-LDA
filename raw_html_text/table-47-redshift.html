                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a platforming game where two people have to control the same character. Inspired
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game centers around Robodude, a heroic robot with color-changing powers on a quest to save the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One person controls Robodude's movement. The other controls Robodude's color and where he shoots. The two players must work together to navigate complex platforms, fight multicolored enemies, and solve puzzles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created art assets in Blender and Photoshop. We developed everything else in Unity.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main mechanic of the game is color switching in order to interact with different colored objects. Making sure the player character, enemies, and projectiles reacted properly with those colors was a major issue.
