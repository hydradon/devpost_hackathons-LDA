                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You scroll through your photo gallery or have images that are untagged for location. You see a friends vacation photos and you want to know exactly where the picture was taken on a map so you can plan your next travel destinations. That's where Pixs and Places comes in!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can upload a picture to our web app and within milliseconds, we map the location using Google AI rendered to the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged the Google Vision API and Google Maps API. On the front-end, we used HTML/CSS/JS. On the backend, we used Python and Flask to run our server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty communicating between the front-end and back-end as well as understanding the use and idea behind base60 binary image files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a working web app which completes the task we aimed to complete
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about HTTP protocols, AJAX, parsing JSON files, the Google Cloud Platform, Debugging and Teamwork!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pixs and Places
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to take pictures of food and map their locations to help people find the places/restaurants they love. Additionally, we are working on an ML model that will learn how to detect the occupancy of bicycle parking spots to assist in traffic flows and convenience. Since this takes a lot of time for us to tag images and train the algorithms, we weren't able to fully complete that feature during the hackathon, but were able to detect bicycles.
