                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would often hear broadcasters complain that they missed the old Channel Feed service, which provided them a way to interact with their users without signing up to other social media accounts. When the AWS Twitch challenge and the close release of the Twitch Configuration Service was released I knew I could focus on this idea for the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Channel feed is a twitch extension which allows users to post updates directly to their channel. There are extensions that show social media accounts but I wanted to provide a service entirely within the twitch ecosystem. Using the affiliate extension you are also able to use bits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started out with an extension for non affiliates which would use no EBS (Extension back end service) and rely solely on services provided by twitch. I was able to store all the post and settings using the new configuration service that twitch has made available to extensions which was a fantastic experience. Deploying this in December let me get some user feedback and make some adjustments and learn the limitations. Then to satisfy the AWS challenge I needed to use an AWS service, I decided to use lambda serverless application to deploy a ASP .Net Core API c# application to process and validate the bits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were quite a few limitations around the configuration service, such as 10 gets and sets per channel and a 5kb size. These were built into the user interface to halt the user from exceeding it, similar to how twitter handles the limit of the size of it's posts.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day I wanted a simple way to replicate the old channel feed which can scale no matter how many people install it. I was able to achieve this so I am happy.

                <p>
                    It was great learning some of the AWS ecosystem, This was mostly new to me and is a good tool for my toolbelt.

                    What's next for Feed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of things, first based on user feedback already they have requested to set the title of the extension like 'News' or 'Updates'. Also while i don't think integration with social media should be required, i can see merit in allowing things like bits to be applied to those too.
