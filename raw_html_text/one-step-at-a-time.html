                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Mentor Walks for women
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app and website that allows users to set preferences (location, date, language, culture, gender, age, interests) and be matched with a walking companion for a one-off walk and talk
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Luigi, our iOS developer built an iOS prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concerns around security risks, will people want to do this, do we need incentives to take part
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick user validation on day 1 with 3 test walks and follow-up interviews
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our assumptions about 1:1 walks may be wrong - maybe small groups or families could be better initially
Need to be careful about conversation topics and sensitive areas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for One step at a time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to build it for real!
