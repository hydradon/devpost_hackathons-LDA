                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this project because I wanted to build and practice the skills I learned in CS162.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My program reads a text file then randomly picks one of the words for the user to guess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using C++ and found an English word list to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having enough time to work on the project was a big factor. I really wanted to work on this project more, but wasn't able to. Also, in my initial design I hadn't accounted for all the input validation that was needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud I got a working game even though I didn't get to all the things I wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about how to manipulate strings, find letters within strings, counting them and so forth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Single Player Hangman version 1.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to make a GUI interface and work on different word lists to include phrases, skill levels, keep track of score, etc so that people of different skill levels can play. I'm sure I will think of other things too!
