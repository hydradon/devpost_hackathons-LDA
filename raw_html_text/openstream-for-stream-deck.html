                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a program in Python that opened OBS, Streamlabs, and all the websites we needed to stream. We wanted to incorporate that but in the Elgato Stream deck, the hotkey controller intended to help streamers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It opens Twitch and StreamLabs with one push of a button. This can expand to open more links if you want.
There is also another button that, when pressed, plays a sample and counts how many times you played that sample.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was programmed using the Elgato SDK in Javascript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to incorporate opening programs because it was a huge security issue with Javascript. Doing so would require me to edit the registry and modify things that made my computer more vulnerable, which is something we weren't willing to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn Javascript and use the Elgato SDK. Most of us had no knowledge of Javascript prior to this hackathon but now we are at least familiar with the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Javascript and read SDK documents. We also learned not to be intimidated and shy away from problems and attack them straight on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OpenStream for Stream Deck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate more functionality and maybe make a new custom mode that uses the streamdeck as a music launchpad with the option to add your own samples from a dropdown menu.
