                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an upperclassmen at NYU, I find food you could purchase in the area near school to be all sorta pricey. Luckily, there is an inefficiency in the market of cheap lunch food around campus. NYU requires freshmen who live in dorms to purchase meal plans, an what happens is that freshmen rarely finish the meals allotted them in a week since most NYU dining halls are buffet-style. Having buffets 3-time a day is simply too much food for anyone.

                <p>
                    foofoo.space is an exchange where students with meal plans could sell their surplus meals and students without meal plans could purchase food at a cheaper rate than the food available near NYU.

                    Solo-hacking is some hard stuff. I didn't realize the amount of work that went into building both the backend and frontend.
