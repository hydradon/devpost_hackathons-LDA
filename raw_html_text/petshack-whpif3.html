                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew our inspiration from Waze and Pokemon Go, both of which are apps that provide social experiences in novel ways in their respective industries. We wanted to do the same for pet owners and lovers, so they can forge stronger relationships with pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PawPoints is an app that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Makes it easier for pet lovers to find pet-friendly locations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Connects them with other pet lovers in the community, who may share similar interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rewards owners who give their pets the care they deserve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Help you find your missing pet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encourages adoption, and the promotion of adoption.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The best part is that users may not even realize that they&rsquo;re doing all this. They&rsquo;re just having fun using the app, competing against their friends, and earning points which gets them rewards and saves them money.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web stack is a Heroku instance, Mongo databased, and Node.js on the backend, with jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Leaflet on the front end. On the iOS side, we created a native app in Objective C using the MapKit framework, with various imported UI packages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from the customary shortage of time at Hackathons, we had a great time working together and playing off each others' personalities and technical strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members worked on a machine-learning based technology to recognize the breeds of several different pets like dogs, cats, and horses. Our iOS teammate was happy that even after not doing mobile work for over a year, he had not lost too much of his knowledge. Our web developers were glad that despite not having really worked together on the same project in the past that each team member was able to make very solid contributions to the end project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ways that technology can help pet adoption and wellness, and help humans develop stronger relationships with their pets. We chose to focus on a subset of the problem but there's plenty of room for innovation in this sector.
