                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone wants to get the edge over their competition, so why not use wearable technology to collect data and analyze performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desktop application allows the user to collect data via the Myo and its Bluetooth dongle, which can then be seen from a website online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desktop app was built with JavaFX for implementing the UI, the JDBC driver for connectivity to a database, and PHP and JS for the website component.  Additionally, we utilized the Myo SDK to interact with the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was fairly difficult to get the data from the Myo and present it in a simple yet effective manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a cloud based solution for the data display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interact with new hardware and face unfamiliar challenged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Free Throw Analyzer with Myo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, only a simple optimal path is shown after analyzing the user's history of successful shots.  We feel that other factors that could be analyzed and displayed for the user.
