                    As electrical, computer, and software engineers, we often face the common problem of having to analyze a circuit and solve for output values. Current software that simulates circuits are very complicated to use, requiring you to manually build the circuit in a program. This can be very tedious in a mobile platform. Our android application allows you to simply take a photo of the resistive circuit you wish to analyze, and it returns the equivalent resistance of the circuit.

                    To detect the different components, we used the Wolfram API's machine learning tool. Though this is not integrated to our code, doing so will be the next step. Once the recognition is processed, we plan to rebuilt the circuit in a matrix which allows us to map how the elements are connected to the different nodes. In our program, we have manually inserted data of preexisting circuit to show that our nodal circuit analysis technique works. Due to the generality of the nodal analysis method, it will be easy to expand this application to not only compute equivalent resistances but also perform complete circuit simulation. Since we had limited time, we were not able to communicate with Wolfram and thus we were not able to calculate the equivalent resistance. However, we have been able to print out the nodal voltage equations and the current equations that can ultimately give us the equivalent resistance (through simple Ohm's law: V = IR).

                    This project has taught us to implement basic, yet powerful functions with the Wolfram Programming Language and use this to simplify our code. It has allowed us to program circuit analysis techniques that will be beneficial to students and engineers alike. With further development, we are confident that the concept behind our application will become a very powerful tool that can be used in both classes and professional working environments in the future.
