                <p>
                    We wanted to find out if question scores of discovery value, actionability, correctness/confidence, and level of expertise correlated with the measure of scientific productivity  Relative Citation Ratio (RCR).

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Relative Citation Ratios (RCR) values are a relatively new metric that are used for biomedical articles, so only around 280 manuscripts were used as datapoints.
Difficult to find a model.

                <p>
                    Scores are not a good predictor of RCR values, but we managed to detect different behavior between readers of across levels of expertise.
