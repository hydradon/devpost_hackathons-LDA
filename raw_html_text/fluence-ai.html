                    <strong>
                        Problem #1
                    </strong>
                    Cloud storage and databases have a single point of failure, are controlled by third-parties, don&rsquo;t scale geographically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Problem #2
                    </strong>
                    Decentralized apps can&rsquo;t use blockchain to store data and perform queries.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fluence is a decentralized encrypted database service based on a swarm of independent nodes. It allows both centralized and decentralized apps to store, manage and share/monetize data. Fluence reduces network roundtrips on data queries to maximize performance with encrypted data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We organize independent nodes to clusters that responsible for a particular database to provide network scalability. Each cluster is supervised by other nodes &ndash; arbiters which check that cluster operates honestly. We provide fast access to data on nodes with B-tree indexes, both encrypted and public. Clusters operate around storage contract that stored on external blockchain as well as a token that represents rewards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fast querying for encrypted data -&gt; We use encrypted B-tree indexes and mutable order-preserving encryption to manage that.
Data sharing without reuploading it -&gt; Solved with proxy re-encryption technology.
