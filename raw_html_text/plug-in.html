                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to do something, but didn't have a friend to do it with? We have -- which is why we wanted to build PlugIn, to help users connect with others in their nearby community and make new friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PlugIn provides an interface for users to create open events to others in the community. Users can search by tags to find events in that category and message the users within those tag communities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized XCode with Google Maps API and Firebase to create an iOS application and manage data like events and user profiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XCode seems particularly difficult to debug because its messages are not very detailed. Issues with the map really slowed down our progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have capitalized on a useful idea that will help people explore their community and interact with others in a new way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API's are not as easy as you think they'll be. We also learned that it is important to communicate and work together to utilize each of our strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlugIn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep making PlugIn better and better by smoothing out all of its processes. We want users to feel like making an event and interacting with each other is fluid and natural. We also hope to develop an android version to allow even more people to use PlugIn!
