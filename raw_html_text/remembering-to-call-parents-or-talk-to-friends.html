                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm terrible at keeping in contact with my friends and family.  I forget to message them or initiate conversations with them or check up on them from time to time.  Most of the time, people have to message me first or I'll never remember that they exist.  My parents get sad that I don't call them enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends reminders to your phone with frequency based off of how important you rate them on a scale of 1-10.  (How frequently you would like to be reminded to talk to them).  In addition, you can include certain notes about the person such as "Ask Paul about his marriage" so you know how to initiate the conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a web app that has a user login system with Python/Flask and SQL.  It also uses Twilio's API to send notifications to your phone.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to implement Twilio's API to get notifications sent to my phone for an indefinite period of time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never made a fully functioning web app that uses a user login system and sends/saves information to a database.  Also my first time using Flask and working with an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how servers and databases communicate and how to use Flask!

                    What's next for Remembering to call parents or talk to friends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing the message sent to your phone to be customized further based off of the "notes" you have on the person.
