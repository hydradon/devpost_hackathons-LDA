                <p>
                    Emergency Responders take 12-13 minutes on average to respond to a call. For every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest without CPR or defibrillation, your odds of survival drop by 7-10%.[1] There are 1000s of off-duty emergency personnel and trained civilians that could take life saving measures if only they were aware of emergencies in their immediate vicinity. Pulse is an app that automatically alerts trained personnel every time a 911 call is placed so they can start life saving procedures until Emergency Responders show up to the scene, drastically improving the odds of survival.
