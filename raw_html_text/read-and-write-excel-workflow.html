                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reading from excel to perform certain task and writing of status to Excel after performing of the certain task are very common as part of the sequence in RPA but unfortunately there is no reusable workflow that can be use in Uipath. Hence, I have created a reusable snippet components(WORKFLOW TEMPLATE).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This workflow allows reading of any excel worksheets from your local drive. It allows selection of excel worksheet from any drive. Thereafter, it is able to determine the last column to write the status back to the same excel that was been read. This workflow allows dynamic column name and column value. It will prompt the user to enter the column name as well as the column value before writing back to the excel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uipath user is now able to incorporate 2 commonly used Excel functions by adding the workflow template in their project instead of re-writing each individual function in their project again.
