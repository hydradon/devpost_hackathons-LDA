                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent spread of false news and we also wanted to create a hack against cyberbullying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incredible Filter gets rid of any false news and alerts you if you try to tweet a false news story. Also, any hateful tweets are hidden from view. This helps normal people distinguish between what is real and what is fake
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM Bluemix and scikit-learn to write our machine learning backend to classify news articles as fake and to classify tweets as hateful. We used Firebase to store tweet info, and we accessed this through the iOS frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to do the machine learning on the news articles, getting Firebase to work with Python 3, and linking the iOS frontend to our backend server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a machine learning SVM with scikit-learn and Bluemix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned an easier way to use IBM APIs as well as how to use the IBM Tone Classifier.
                </p>

                    What's next for Incredible Feed

                <p>
                    A stronger machine learning backend.
