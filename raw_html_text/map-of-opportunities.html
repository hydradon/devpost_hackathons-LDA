                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our desire to be able to easily find and discover new experiences without having to rely on our parents and teachers all the time. Our program was also created because we thought it was important to support the building of relationships with new people since we all met at the HackTJ event, 24 hours before we finished our project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application allows people to find events and opportunities of interest in their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We got help from mentors, workshops and the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us had much experience in web development, we came into this competition uncertain of how we would be able to build a website from scratch in under 24 hours. Our lack of experience made it challenging and more time consuming to learn about GitHub, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud to have an actual website at the end of the competition. It was gratifying to see how much we were able to accomplish in under 24 hours with friends we had just met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about each other and about coding during this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Map of Opportunities
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to complete everything in time for this competition so in the future, when we have more time we hope to replace our list of states with an interactive map of the United States. We would also want to claim a domain page and utilize a server.
