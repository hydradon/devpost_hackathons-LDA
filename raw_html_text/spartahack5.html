                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to look into app development and that led us to android studio and we wanted to make an app that integrates a location tracking service that also allowed us to also use the camera to quick access and take pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the google location services and maps API allows user to see/track their own location as well as search and view other locations and allows the use/accessibility of a camera function from the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to build our app and used tutorials as guidance for the coding. Also we designed the look of the app as an on the go basis looking to see what buttons looked best where they were.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problems implementing the api, but we were able to figure it out through some research. We also had problems integrating the camera onto the maps page and we had to change some stuff around for it to run properly.  Another challenge that we faced is that neither one of us knew java very well so we had to learn as we went.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first spartahack and we are proud of building/integrating a working Android App that integrates Google's API's and learning a lot about app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about app development and the use/implementation of API's and how to integrate them to better our Apps. We also learned the basics and some intermediate techniques of android studio and how to develop apps for androids.
                </p>
