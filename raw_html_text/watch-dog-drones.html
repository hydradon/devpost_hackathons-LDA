                    Inspiration Wanted to improve security for the smaller airlines at a cheap price.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It is a grid system of drones that can scan the perimeter of the airline that can sense motion and trigger a loud alarm to scare any unwanted creature away from the airline
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it We took apart a drone and replaced it's circuit board with an arduino board.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into The team doesn't have enough experience in arduinos to complete the prototype
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Learning more about how to use the arduino and having the ability as a team to have a consensus on the design of the drone.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned I should look for more help when needed at this hackathon, and it's great to work as a team.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Watch Dog Drones Hopefully it will take flight at a small airstrip to show it's potential.
