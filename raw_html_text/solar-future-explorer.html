                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Net metering has been essential to the incredible growth of residential solar across the US. However it is under threat as utilities seek to better cover their costs. What does the future of solar look like under different policy alternatives to net metering?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We visualise the savings and payoff time of solar under a variety of alternative net metering policy scenarios. On an individual house level we also visualise the expected daily savings under different policy scenarios.

                    Add in functionality to see how batteries and energy storage change the value of solar systems when net metering is not allowed.
