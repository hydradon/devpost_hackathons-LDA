                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vision was inspired mainly from our own experiences. We came to realize that in order for us to take a simple 30 min lunch-break we have to spent about an hour at work to compensate for an unaccounted 30 min with a good lunch costing around 4 euros in an ordinary restaurant. After asking around, people agreed on the same thought and we felt that we could help people by making such an application that could track this difference. The functionality was based on activity tracking applications, which we bent to our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking in your spendings and reevaluate them depending on your monthly/hourly income. Reevaluation output is an approximate amount of hours you would have to spend at work to compensate for your spendings. To make the application more uplifting you can record your past work time or set a real-time timer for the work you are about to do and by that gradually decrease the overall amount of hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope this app brings an interesting view of how much time does a person have to spend at work in order to afford small expenses. It would make a person think twice before spending on small things. It would save you time and eventually money as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we discussed over how the application would look like and over some time, we came to a single conclusion that it would be more suitable to create a mobile view mainly because of our target audience, and therefore we focused the whole application solely for it. As far as the technologies go, we decided on ReactJS. Why? ReactJS is a very fast-growing cutting edge technology that can handle well the user input and reacts based on these initiatives. After preparing the basic wireframes and how the UI/UX would look like, we dove into making the components to represent every piece of our application and the highlight of our application is the timer which converts the money to time and by starting it/stopping it, you can record the amount of spent work time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data, we based our application on, was the Tatrabank excel sheet, consisting of expenses of six random group of people, which we transferred into the blockchain. We want to provide all of our users the capability to back up the user private finance transactions without the need of centralized authority (moving the data from a device to device is just a matter of remembering 12 words to restore a "wallet"). As the blockchain is only insert-only, the technology is right-suited for our application.

                <p>
                    Is it better to create branches in order to avoid merge conflicts and we deepened our knowledge of the technology we used.
