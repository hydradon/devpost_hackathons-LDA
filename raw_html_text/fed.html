                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem of food waste is seen in a daily basis. Having the technology we have available, we should be able to create a system to help us reduce the harm in our planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fed, will work with a locked refrigerator system, like a vending machine, Fed will generate a QR code for students to have access to food stored in the refrigerator system. Through the app we will be able to provide liability security for both parties, the schools and the students. 
The app will also receive notification from the refrigerator system when there is food available. It will work through a system of smart scanners that will send the notification when they detect the presence of food

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used html to create a prototype of an app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do not know too much about html yet, so it was hard to figure out how to add images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype gives a really good accuracy of how the application should look like.

                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <h2>
                    What's next for FED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fed will need to be presented to schools and other institutions to be able to get funding and make the project real.
