                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I myself have issues with slouching and I have seen it at every hackathon I have been to. Technology's purpose was to make life easier but it seems to have come at this cost. People's necks are craned downward toward their phones, laptops, tablets, etc. and their necks become stuck this way, hence Nerd Neck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Program uses VR to create a fun game as an exercise routine to fix this severe issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We rented an Oculus Rift VR Headset from the hardware lab to build this project out and used Unity to write our scripts and use our models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many challenges were present including lack of documentation for VR and issues within the Unity Editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We am proud of the fact that we can save several people from a plethora of issues that result from having a nerd neck such as terrible posture, weak back muscles, lower pain tolerance, and many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about developing VR apps and realized that it is a huge step up from regular 2D and 3D games for 2 reasons: debugging is a lot harder and geometry becomes more complex than on the 2 dimensional scale.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nerd Neck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As VR becomes more mainstream in the future, more people will begin to use devices like the Oculus Rift and therefore use our app to bust their issues.
