                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went out for a break and were yelled at by a Plover bird. The more closer we came to the bird, the more it would tweet. This gave us the idea to make a productivity extension that would give you warnings as you came closer to your deadlines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Plover extension allows a Google Chrome user to input their tasks and then rate them out of 5 for how much weight they want to give to the particular task. Then the user will input the number of hours that they have to complete their tasks. Our extension will use the user's ratings of each task to determine how much time they should spend on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult for us to create a chrome extension that would interact with the functions in our JavaScript file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a functional chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create Chrome extensions, Bootstrap, and more of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plover
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to have our extension learn the user's activity and tailor the extension to the user's pace of productivity.
