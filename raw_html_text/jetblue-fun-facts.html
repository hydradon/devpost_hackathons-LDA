                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by JetBlue's customer-focused mission. JetBlue offers free snacks on flight and will now provide in-flight trivia games.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Java program utilizes the JOptionPane class to ask the questions and calculate the score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Eclipse, we coded in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize the limitations of our coding skills. We actually taught ourselves arrays and JOptionPane today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed a functioning trivia game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained invaluable teamwork skills to complete a project within a deadline. We learned that with a bit of motivation we can advance our skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for jetBlue Fun-Facts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program can be expanded with more levels, prizes, social media integration on the back-end, and better graphic design on the front-end.
