                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create something interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two players go head-to-head in this fun and simple game.  The board flashes red, then yellow, and then after a random number of seconds (between .1 and 8) the board flashes green.  The first player to press their respective button after the board turns green recieves 1 point.  The first player to get 5 points wins!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an Adafruit Circuit Playground and programmed it in Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to figure out how to get the game to stop after somebody had won, rather than just starting both players back at 0 points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to create this after first being exposed to it less than 24 hours ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot can be done with a little knowledge and a little help.
                </p>

                    What's next for Reaction Time Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A counter of how many times each player has won, flashier light sequences when a player wins.
