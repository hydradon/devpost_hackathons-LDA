                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an experience with poison ivy while hiking, and it hurts. Blisters, rashes, itchiness... We targeted the fact that so many people are unaware of where poison ivy &amp; other poisonous plants are, hoping to help people hike and walk w/o being in contact with poison ivy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lets users take a picture and upload the picture (of the hazardous plant) to the app. They can also enter in the name if they know what the hazardous plant is called. The information will be stored in the map, which shows a marker of where the hazardous plant is located. Users will be able to see these pictures, and when they enter a region, they can check if there are other users who posted about a hazardous plant, and therefore they will be warned. This will prevent many people from experiencing the things we had to...

                    How We Built It:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using thunkable, which had blocks enabling us to code.

                    Website or App? 
This was also our first time at a hackathon.

                    Making an app in less than 2 days!!!

                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build an app using thunkable. We also learned that coding something takes a lot of energy, effort, patience, and brain power!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting in another program in the app so that if a user scans a plant with the app, the app will search for similar photos in its database of what other users have uploaded, and will be able to tell the user what the plant's name is, the symptoms it may cause, the locations where it is mostly located, and the medical treatments or prescriptions.
