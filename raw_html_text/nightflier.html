                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the Lockheed Martin challenge, as well as classic bullet hell games such as Touhou.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game in which the player dodges mass amounts of bullets while trying to rescue Testudo and destroy the turrets shooting at it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built almost exclusively in processing. We used piskel editor which allowed us to make the animated pixel art
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge that we ran into was the IDE we were using (processing). It is an IDE that is intended for beginners and does not officially support many of the more complex functions that we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the working product. Our main goal for BitCamp was to leave  with a product that worked and we could be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new things about processing. It is a very interesting IDE and now that we have been using it for the last 36 hours we can all say that we have a very strong understanding of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nightflier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was very fun for us. We would love to expand the project perhaps to a new platform.
                </p>
