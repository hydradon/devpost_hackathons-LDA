                    1. Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2012, the US has half of the world's passenger cars (about 300 million units). The need for parking space will grow as the US population grows (projected to be 460 million people in 2050)[ref 1]. It is obvious that people and their cars grow much faster than the expansion of parking spaces in cities. More than just inconvenience, lack of efficient parking can slow the economy down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team are also aware of the fact that 1/3 of US downtown open spaces are parking spaces. Isn't that great if we can further exploit those spaces, bringing more interactions, open new advertising channels and gather more statistics?

                    How fast a parking lot will change 5 years from now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is undeniable that changes come at a faster speed than before. Flexibility and scale-ability are not optional anymore. Thanks to PubNub, the system has a
                    <strong>
                        clear modular design
                    </strong>
                    . For example, We decided to go with cheap sensors (HC-SR04). As time goes by and sensors get more powerful yet cheaper, we can add or replace sensors (or even controller boards) without modifying or stopping the server or the mobile client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python was used to code the server. It is not just a fast language but also a language of choice for statistic and machine learning. Server is then placed on a python cloud and is super scalable.  By lifting a major processing power from the actual end-point and move it to the parking management servers, we allow faster updates to keep up with future changes.

                            Our system allows fine categorization of parking sections with different per-hour or per-day rates that can be easily updated by system administrators. Users while checking the mobile client app for empty parking spots will also be able to see zones with corresponding rates and pick the ones that fit their needs. This can be part of a really good marketing/business model that we will discus more in the "Location based advertising/promotion" section

                            Links to deals/coupons can be placed on empty slots on user's mobile client. It is an effective way to promote brand because psychologically, users were actively looking for empty spots on the map - brand image will be associated with the positive feeling of "I found a spot". It will even more effective if the parking spot is near the business.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Organizations/individuals will also be able to have their banner or message displayed on empty parking spots in the mobile app for a small fee.

                <p>
                    During important events, business can sponsor certain spots through our systems and their loyal members will receive discounts when parking in those spots.
                </p>

                    This concept can be used for UMSL and other heavy traffic areas.

                            Prior parking slot user can leave an anonymous for message for later parking user of the same slot. This promotes communication and networking between users within an organization. Some messages can be served as safety warnings, stress reliever, morale booster.

                    We believe our solution is secure, scalable and affordable. The architecture is highly modular. The price for each main module is cheap. For example, the ultra sonic we use only costs $2 per sensor. One controller board ($80 to $100) can support 10 to 20 sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to have the opportunity to implement this idea around campus and scale up to Downtown St. Louis.
