                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of the four of us are TA's for intro computer science courses here at UB and we write small chunks of code on the whiteboards a lot. We may understand syntax and know when we make a mistake but an intro student may not. This is a helpful tool to enable a quick solution for a student to check to see if their function is correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It checks the syntax of the text seen in the photo and then if there are no syntax errors it compiles and runs the code. The code it is currently set up to syntax check and run is C and is compiled using GCC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A python server handles incoming image data from our app side as a bytes array. This encoded image is passed to the backend which then analyzes the image using Google's OCR to get the text information. It then goes through post-processing to format it as close to the way an actual C program would be. It is able to fix a few small syntax mistakes that may be caused by not recognizing a character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have this project demo ready to be able to show a live feed rather than a static image. But because of the lack of resources, we tried to write our own AR API for this task. However, due to time constraints, all that is ready for the demo is the static image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're especially proud of getting the compiling and returning the data returned by the program when run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about AR core, C syntax nuances, and post-processing image data.
