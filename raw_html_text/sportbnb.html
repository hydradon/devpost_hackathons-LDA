                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sport is a great way to stay fit and healthy. Sports also teaches us big lessons for life, while encouraging a sense of belonging and identity, bringing people together in this increasingly fragmented society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans are, by nature social animals. In the past we were hunters and gatherers and that competitive spirit is still in us. This is evident in the fact that most sports are team sports and require more than 2 players. There is a common problem of finding other players especially if someone is new to the place and aren't great at socializing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Sai (team member) personally, when he was a new student to the University of Waterloo, it was hard to find others who were interested in playing badminton. The student clubs were extremely crowded and weren't effective. It was a tedious to reach out to others, asking if they're interested in playing and would be available at a certain time. Again, having no prior understanding on what their skill level was, made the sport either too boring or too hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no dedicated platform where one can meet other players who aren't professional yet love to play a sport. This in fact, could be one reason why people have hard time playing sports.

                    Flask user authentication was difficult to implement

                    Allowing multiple users at any one point in time was challenging
