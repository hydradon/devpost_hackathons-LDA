                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something cool, functional, and useful after the hackathon was over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows you to control your music with the swipe of a finger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a leap motion sensor and java to create our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fine tuning the sensitivity of the sensor was a little difficult and time consuming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program 100% works (to the best of our knowledge)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Look for existing solutions, APIs are a great great thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aounify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to implement a neural network to add custom gestures not supported by the leap motion API. We will also add a user interface that allows the user to interact with their program in a more traditional manner.
