                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a web application to make people enjoy traveling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an application for users to receive riddles and to complete checkpoints and a web application for organizers to plan their game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of caffeine. And of course with patience for every bug that stood in our way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a database to synchronize with the web app and the mobile one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to provide a nice interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use javascript and ssh better. Learning to use firebase. Further knowledge in developing websites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hunter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    more functionalities, of course, we are thinking about maybe prizes and a method of speaking with a virtual bot as the main interaction of the user with a game.
