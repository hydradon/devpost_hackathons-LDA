                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gavin recently purchased glasses online and was frustrated at how difficult it was to measure pupil distance manually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end code allows a user to use their webcam to measure the distance between their eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Opencv.js library we were able to manipulate images to measure the length using a credit card as a reference image and then using face-feature detection to pinpoint the centers of the eye and measure the pupil distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    being able to measure both the credit card and pupil distance on a live video stream. Measuring on still pictures was achievable but required several images and piecing together data
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were able to measure the distance of the pupils on a live webcam stream
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a lot about opencv and computer vision techonology
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making credit card measurements and pupil measurements happen together.
