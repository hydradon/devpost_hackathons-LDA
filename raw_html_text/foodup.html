                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was the lack of readily-available, comparative information regarding price and nutrition of food in our area.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sorting algorithm that considers multiple nutrition parameters and price was a large initial hurdle. Implementing geo-coding for the location service also proved to be difficult.

                    In the future we want to add support for more nutritional categories as well as dietary restrictions, such as Vegetarian and Gluten-Free items. We also plan on tailoring the individual user experience further by using height and weight data to provide more accurate daily nutritional value estimations when suggesting the best nearby options for your needs.
