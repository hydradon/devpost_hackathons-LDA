                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a simple exercise app that would guide users through workouts that they can easily do at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Assistant app (or ideally Google Home), it will ask users for a day to focus on, push, pull, or legs, and will give exercises based on the chosen day.  Then, it will tell them reps, sets, and rest times for each exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With great effort (in learning Node JS and different APIs)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the API for Dialogflow and Google Cloud (completely new for us)
Trying to communicate with our Cloud Datastore database. 
Trying to find a supported timer
Trying to connect Google Home Mini to a wifi network
Setting up and downloading libraries to deploy our program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing with a functional product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, connecting Google Home commands to a backend through Google Cloud Services, using Google Cloud Datastore
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Exercise Guide for Google Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Ideally creating an app or website so users can upload their own exercise regimes
-Being able to orally communicate to Google Home to make your own exercise regime
-Implementing difficulties for the programs
