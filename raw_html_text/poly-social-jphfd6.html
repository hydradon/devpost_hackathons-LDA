                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something so students could have an easier time finding clubs that work with them, as well as study groups that work with their needs and their schedule.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poly Social provides one platform for students to be aware of the events that are happening on campus. It also provides an environment for them to engage with other students to create study circles.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an interactive mock-up using Adobe-XD. From there, we used Android Studio to create the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges my team and I ran into while using Android studio. We had never used it before, and it took quite a lot of getting used too. One member is also very new to java, and none of us had really used xml before.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a navigation screen that went through four different screens and created the UI for the screens. While not all of the screens were functional, I was pround that we were able to figure out the UI and work towards a working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about mobile devolopement and how to use layout and UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Poly Social
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully adding extra funcitonality and being albe to created a very easy to use way for poly students to get connected with eachother.
