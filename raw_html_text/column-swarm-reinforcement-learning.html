                    Column Swarm Reinforcement Learning (CSRL) is a swarm intelligence model composed of a bi-directional hierarchy of "swarmling"-minicolumns developed based on HTM technology. Each column can solve many simple tasks on its own, but together they can solve large-scale problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSRL is on other words a lot of little reinforcement learners that work together to create one big reinforcement learner, where the resulting hierarchical model looks astoundingly like HTM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea of using a swarm intelligence model with HTM after seeing Jeff's 6-layer model of the neocortex. I thought of ways that the construction of such a hierarchy could be done automatically. I had previously had some success using swarms of simpler learning automata, and with the development of SDRRL (an ultra-efficient "swarmling") and its similarity to cortical minicolumns used in HTM I decided to make a fully blown hierarchy with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrote it in C++, first on the CPU. I will move it to the GPU using OpenCL soon.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSRL is composed of a lot of small reinforcement learners that work together. I wrote a tutorial for a single on of those reinforcement learners (called SDRRL, sparse distributed representation reifnorcement learning). At least, this is what it will be composed of in the future; currently it is composed of simple OLPOMDP learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a tutorial on how to create SDRRL:

                        link
                    </a>
                    A tutorial on the full swarm will come soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These SDRRL units are organized into a hierarchy, where the actions of a unit are fed in as inputs to other units. Each unit optimizes locally, but the end result is that the whole swarm optimizes globally as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optimizing SDRRL. SDRRL is insanely fast be default, but I need to run potentially
                    <em>
                        millions
                    </em>
                    of SDRRL swarmlings at once. So I came up with several mechanisms to exploit the SDRRL sparsity to reduce computational costs.

                <p>
                    GPU version, more demos. Performance improvements. Integrate SDRRL into CSRL (Instead of OLPOMDP).
