                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How can we create a world where people interact comfortably, sans harassment? There's Grammarly for checking our grammar and spelling, but not tool that can check our aggression. Instead of a punitive system that takes our freedom to post away, we created a chrome extension that gently reminds the user that what they say can hurt others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads input fields in your browser for harmful language, or language that may be perceived as offensive, and highlights potential inflammatory terms. The progress bar at the bottom shows you how aggressive your text may be to give the user a quantifiable idea of how they may be offending others online.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    It's still in the works! Please check out the website below to view how we plan to complete building it and click learn more to view a presentation about how it works and will!
