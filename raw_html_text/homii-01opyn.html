                    Homebits is a mobile-first application that allows immigrants to store and share those "little bits of home" they find in their adopted hometown.  Think Yelp or Foursquare for familiar/friendly experiences in a strange land.

                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very simple UI for allowing users to drop pins ("bits") on a map as breadcrumbs that will be useful to others of the same national/regional/ethnic origin.  These may be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Places of worship.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Businesses and professionals that speak your native tongue.

                    <li>
                        Restaurants with familiar tastes, smells, &amp; cultural influences.

                    <li>
                        Potential employers whom employ, or may even be, members of your expat community.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        anything else that can help future immigrants of the same origin feel a little more at home in their new land
                    </em>
                    , just like it did for you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Key to innovating on this theme for us was
                    <strong>
                        tailoring the data available to each user on the basis of a shared place of origin
                    </strong>
                    . In other words, once a user has told us where they are from once, points of interest are then always filtered to those that have been recommended by others from the same region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otherwise, we are drawing heavily upon the user's familiarity with other applications on the same device, such as those for navigation (Google Maps, Waze, etc.) and local discovery (Yelp, Foursquare).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        No designer
                    </strong>
                    :  As a team of orphans who just met Friday, we quickly reached our 8-person limit without a real designer on the roster.   The result is a product that still needs some design TLC, but whose concept places function over form and delivers well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Not all skillsets are plug-and-play
                    </strong>
                    :  Half our dev team came from a different stack than the other half.  They adapted well and made it work, but not without some pain and setbacks, some fairly late in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Inventory hacking
                    </strong>
                    :  obviously an application like this requires some inventory as a map with no points of interest on it solves nothing.  While we were able to establish a number of supply-side strategies for finding relevant reviews and data with which to populate the database at launch;  time spent debugging eliminated our ability to test any of our hypotheses for an effective supply hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we truly feel that homebits addresses each and every focus area included in the challenge in a real and evergreen way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've come up with a UI that is language- and literacy-agnostic; using iconography and common UI elements to create an application that can be understood and navigated by anyone whom is already accustomed to using other applications on their device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than hold out for a designer, we chose to be inclusive, adapted well and came out with a product that we're all proud of.  We hope you'll agree it was the right call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remote work is great, but the ability to lean over and talk something out is not something whose value can be overlooked when time + resources are limited.
                </p>

                    What's next for Homebits

                    We just met each other Friday.  No promises yet :)
