                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Education and programming are important parts of our lives, so we decided to blend the two together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ventus brings learning to code to a whole new level. Virtual reality allows abstract concepts to become tangible, creating a space for potential programmers to explore and learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Ventus on Unreal Engine 4, each of us taking turns to learn and code in the new programming environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of experience was a major hurdle that we had to overcome while creating Ventus. It was through many sleepless hours and countless minutes of YouTube that we were finally able to create something that we were proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created a virtual reality experience, something that none of us had experience doing before. We are also delighted to have made what we believe is a unique experience, that blended our love for education and programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through these 24 hours, we've learnt to not be discouraged by failures and hardships. We learnt to keep our chin up and our spirits high, ultimately realizing that hardships lead to great success!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VENTUS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fans can look forward to a fully immersive virtual reality programming course, with a full suite of tools to both train and test their coding prowess. Join us in revolutionizing the way we engage with the digital world.
