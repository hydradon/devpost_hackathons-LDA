                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we all struggle with engineering career fairs. The lines are long, there's a lot of people, and you're not even sure if the recruiter wants to talk to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make this recruiting process better and less archaic, so we came up with a queue system to cut down on the lines to provide a faster experience for students. CareerLine's iOS/web apps allow the user to find their career fair, choose the company they want to talk to, and sign up for that company's queue. The user will then receive SMS updates on their position in the line and their wait time, found by averaging other user's time they've spent in line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app was built with Xcode/Swift, using the Firebase Cocoa Pod. The web app was built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, Twilio for SMS, and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app was tough to get the UI figured out programmatically at first. Once we got going with that, we struggled with storing the user's in the right company's queue in Cloud Firestore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well together building multiple platforms using the same Firestore. I am also proud that we made such an involved and complex project within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Cloud Firestore in iOS and how to be a better collaborator using source control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CareerLine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more information about the queue you're in, the capability to view the queue in the iOS app, and to be able to remove yourself from the queue.
