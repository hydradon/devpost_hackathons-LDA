                    The inspiration comes from basically going with my skillset and staying to something fairly basic because I learned python LITERALLY YESTERDAY NO JOKE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program is basically an extremely creepy text-based adventure game with the main character being a crazy, criminal psychopath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built it using basic python language and no GUI so that it stays true to that text-based rustic look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into were not being familiar enough with the language and libraries of python and all the applications to use like tkinter, eclipse, pycharm, IDLE and such because again, this is a new language for me as of yesterday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud honestly just that I was able to complete a working application considering my lack of knowledge for Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a new coding language through this experience.
Next year I don't plan to work alone and I would like to join a group of 2 or three and combine hardware and software hacking.
