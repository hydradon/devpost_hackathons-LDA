                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love Twitter, and who on Twitter doesn't love slang? We wanted to be able to relate to ANYONE on Twitter in a meaningful way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It replies to tweets with a slang phrase that has a similar overall sentiment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twitter API with Tweepy, get requests, and TextBlob
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us were sleep deprived coming in, a lot of us had no idea what we wanted to make, and we ran into a lot of challenges importing and using certain Python modules properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to complete our project! Not everyone gets to demo at hackathons and we're proud that we are ready!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Twitter API and the TextBlob Python Module
                </p>

                    Probably not a lot...
