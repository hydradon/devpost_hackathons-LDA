                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our inability to acquire an oculus rift at YHack, we were looking forward to using one in any implementation. As we are entering the job market soon, in search of summer internships, we thought about how many people, students in particular, do not have sufficient interviewing experience. Thus, our idea was to use VR to provide these people with the ability to train and succeed with interviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack simulates an interview scenario to aid in the practice of interviewing skills and the removal of improper speech patterns using Unity, Oculus and IBM Watson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, starting and interview scenes were created and animations were implemented. The backend of the speech processing system was built with IBM Watson Unity tools. These tools allowed for the integration for IBM speech to text api's and allow the user's speech to be converted into text and later processed for the output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While implementing IBM Watson speech to text, Oculus Rift compatibility, and Unity Scenes, we came across a few errors. Firstly, we had been working in different versions of unity, so when the time came to compile our projects together there were compatibility issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One things we are proud of how we overcame the many challenges that arose during this project. We were also proud of the overall implementation of the different facets of the hack and how we were able to mesh them all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us had to learn how to use and implement virtual reality as none of us had the opportunity to work with it before. We also learned a lot about Unity and implementing items such as VR and IBM Watson speech to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InterVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing more thorough testing on the speech to text file would be the first large improvement that could be made for InterVR. Another improvement that could be made for InterVR is a more diverse cast of interviewers, additional scenes for the interviews, and more questions to allow the user to have a more specialized experience.
