                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main concerns of today's society is the increasing number of responsibilities that an individual has in their lives. In many ways, a person has many goals to want to achieve but unfortunately, the inability to plan out how to target such wishes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution, Chroniclr, allows our users to submit their journal entries about what they have and will achieve in the feature, and allow them to track the goals that users would like to accomplish. Journal entries are analyzed with natural language processing to generate quests for the user and experience points to level up their skills in life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with a React frontend, Python and Flask backend, and a MongoDB database. A portion of the NLP analysis of the journal entries was done leveraging GCP NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty managing our time properly between features we wanted to implement due to inaccurate predictions at the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the progress we've made since the last year we participated in NwHacks together, going from a basic bot last year to a full-stack web app this year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that frontend is a lot harder than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chroniclr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have plans for implementing additional features for tracking users' mental health by leveraging sentiment analysis of their journal entries, and providing mental health resources when users reach critical thresholds. Furthermore, we plan on further game-ifying the app with more character sprites, in-app economy for gearing up users' character, and graph visualizations of users' productivity, growth, and mental health over time.
