                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fashion industry is the 2nd biggest polluter in the world, second to only the oil and gas industry. Fast fashion, the act of copying the latest catwalk styles, is rapidly increasing in popularity and hence, deeply concerning from a sustainability perspective. Today, only 10% of Canadians shop for second-hand clothing, thus our goal is to provide a convenient means to tap into these markets by incentivizing consumers to use our website and buy more second-hand clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application allows thrift shop businesses to upload images of clothing they would like to market. Our application enables consumers to upload an image of a piece of clothing that they would like to buy and our application finds a quick match of cheap, recyclable options that are similar in design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided  to build a progressive web application. Our wireframes for the front-end were prototyped with figma; then built with HTML/CSS/Javascript with JQuery to make api requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the backend, we used express to build the api endpoints and mongoDB to store data pertaining to businesses and thrift stores who upload photos to the app. Uploaded photos are run through Google Cloud Computer Vision API and return classification information to our backend server to utilize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then run a KNN Machine Learning algorithm to return images that are similar to the query image uploaded by the consumer and relevant descriptions provided by the retail stores.
                </p>
