                    Over the summer some of my friends got me more into Dungeons and Dragons, I really enjoyed playing with them but I hated making character sheets, so I figured this could help in the winter if we get together for a one-shot. This project helped me to learn a lot about how to use javafx and css together. I have a decent amount of experience working with java swing but the UI always ended up being lackluster and confusing. For this project, I used the javafx Scenebuilder to quickly generate fxml objects and properly set up a frontend. I then connected this to a character object made using a random race, playerClass, and charBackground which contained the data and methods needed to calculate the stats on the character sheet. This project ended up being significantly more difficult than I originally thought because the data and methods that different classes used were somewhat vague and changed from class to class. I also did not have too much game knowledge coming into the project so I had to spend a good amount of time just figuring out some of the details that my friends from home would usually help me figure out. The scale of the game also provided a challenge because of how many different classes, races, and backgrounds there are, so I ended up scaling down the scope of the project to Three classes, races, and backgrounds. This was done so that a product would be ready in time for the demo.
