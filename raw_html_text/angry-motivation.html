                <p>
                    The purpose of this skill was to be efficient. In thinking about how I could make life easy using alexa, I realized that most people are affected by what mood they are in. If I could find a way to get people excited and motivated about their goals and passions. They can be more efficient in their daily routines.Therefore i decided to come up with Angry Motivation. Why angry motivation you might ask? Once we're angry, we're also determined. We want success and we want it now. Anger is an emotion that can fuel us to great success.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this skill by leveraging AWS lambda and S3. Lambda hosted my function, which allowed me to process all of my intents and handlers to determine my skills output. S3 hosted all the processed audio used in the lambda function. It generated https links; This allowed me to use the audio src tag and add it to my function's output. Then i used amazon developer's website to create my front end. I created my intents and utterances on this page. Upon completion, i tested the skill in aws, the amazon developer test simulator and echosim. This was to make ensure there were no bugs.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered problems turning my ssml audio into a homecard. The type was set incorrectly and therefore it failed certification. i did some debug and found out the audo src tag was being displayed in the other views. It was simple past that point.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the fact a skill as simple as this can be so effective. It eliminates the complexity and gives you a dose of motivation with no problem. I am proud i was able to accomplish the whole end to end flow by myself.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learn't how to better construct my handles and understand the needs of users. Knowing how to program the skill was just the first hurdle. Understanding how the user will interact with the skill gives you more information and perspective to create an amazing skill.
