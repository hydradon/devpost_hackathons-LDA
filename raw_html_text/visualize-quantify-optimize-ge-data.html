                    Inspiration for SIMOGGA Solutions
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The competition is fierce worldwide, companies compete with each other and the management focuses on the cost production while trying to keeping its energy footprint low.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the basis of the development of the SIMOGGA Solutions aiming at Visualizing, Quantifying and Optimizing the shop floor layout, the MRO processes as well the Warehouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to help companies to produce, maintain and recycle locally and keep the jobs locals

                    We want to use the data collected by the WIP Manager and propose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        New shop floor layout increasing the capacity of the factory and reducing the production costs

                    <li>
                        Optimized MRO processes increasing drastically the usage of the material by reducing the time required to repair, maintain it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optimized Warehouse management to ensure that the customer waits a minimum of time at the desk or waits for the delivery
