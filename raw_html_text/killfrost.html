                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mario run, Metal Slug.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User can move character using the touch screen controls (sides and jumping). He can do everything using only one hand. The original plan was to make fighting automatic releasing the user of certain problems such as the required use of both arms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of Jesus Christ and John Lennon. Seriously though, we used Unity, C# and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to bugs with Unity compiler we were not able to finish the application. We did not implement the enemy AI and fighting system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have found some great people, made new friends, but most importantly learned many new things in regards to Unity. Not to mention the invaluable experience of game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity development and Game production workflow.
                </p>

                    What's next for KillFrost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on joining Game Bash (at least some of us) to further expand our knowledge and finish the game. For now it is in a rather rough shape, but we believe that there is some strong concept behind it that just needs some extra refinement.
