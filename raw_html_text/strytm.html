                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thought originally came from fruit ninja, a mobile game where you cut fruit and dodge bombs to earn points. But instead of cutting fruit, what if you could cut words that build into a story? &amp; with that, Fables were born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a user to create Fables. Words are cycled on the screen and the user selects their path by opening their mouth. Similar to ad-libs. Based on the fable they create, different 3D objects appear in the view, allowing you to create &amp; live in your own fable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Spark AR Studio to create the AR experience and Javascript to change properties on those objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the Spark AR API to interact with objects and setting up monitor subscriptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get the MVP functionality. Our 3rd team member also didn't show up, which forced us to build the product (&amp; chemistry) fast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use Spark AR with no prior experience. We create objects and interact with these objects using Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fables
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement functionality to share the fable with your friends. Also, it would be cool to change it from opening your mouth to select a word to a gesture, similar to fruit ninja. Instead of cutting fruit, you'd cut the word that you want to go further in the fable. This gamifies the experience even further, allowing users to work harder (&amp; smarter) for the fable they want.
