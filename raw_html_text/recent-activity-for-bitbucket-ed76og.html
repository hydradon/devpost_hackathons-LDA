                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to see an overview of a repository (especially what's been going on recently) on one page in Bitbucket instead of navigating around to different pages within the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shows a list of recent branch activity and pull request activity all on the repository overview page in Bitbucket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Javascript and the the great Bitbucket REST API documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Restricting the scope of the project and not trying to do it all "the right way" and over-engineer it. Processing the REST API data into a useful format.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Getting it built!

                    What's next for Recent Activity for Bitbucket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved UI and better error handling. We'll see what feature requests I get as well :)
