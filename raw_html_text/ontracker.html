                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an extension which would help users be more efficient when working with the internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it keeps track of Top 5 Websites Visitied, a piece of code which would warn users if they decide to go onto a site which they deem to be non-efficient (i.e. User inputs "facebook.com," then a warning would be given to the user everytime he or she goes to a Facebook link, an alarm which will sound if the user is inactive, a note taking section, and hopefully more before the expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the Chrome API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, working with Chrome was difficult, since it was our first time building a Chrome extension
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we made a decently functioning Chrome Extension
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what goes behind building Chrome Extensions, as well as learn the Chrome API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for onTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, add more features, with "Time Spent on Websites" being a priority
                </p>
