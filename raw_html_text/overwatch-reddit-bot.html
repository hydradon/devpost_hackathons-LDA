                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a reddit bot for the /r/leagueoflegends subreddit and were inspired to do something similar for another one of our favorite games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will search comments for a specific command to search heroes and reply with some information about the indicated hero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a python script using PRAW (a python wrapper for the reddit api)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues when scraping the Overwatch website for the information we needed, and we had some problems when we tried to format the Reddit comments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have actually used python before and 2 of the 3 of us had no experience working with APIs, so building a functional program in python using the Reddit API was pretty cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned python and a bit about APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Overwatch Reddit Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to maybe attach images and some numbers for the hero abilities and maybe add some more commands. We would also like to have the script run on a server.
                </p>
