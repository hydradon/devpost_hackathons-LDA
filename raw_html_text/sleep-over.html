                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving social responsibility by helping each other improve accountability. We often times ask our friends to help us achieve our personal goals as a way to hold ourselves more accountable for our actions. SleepOver takes one specific instance of this - waking up in the morning - and automates the process of asking your friends to wake you up in the morning.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows you to ask your friends to help wake you up at specified time you desire. Using multiple layers of detection, including a step counter check, our application holds you accountable for your actions and ensures that you are truly awake.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Expo's XDE, React Native, and Firebase for our database management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble displaying the desired component page after clicking on a push notification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was fun to see our push notification system work, as well as integrating various expo components - such as drawing from our user contacts and pedometer system in our phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we learned how to use the Expo tool as well as how to work with React Native components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SleepOver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for SleepOver would be to expand it beyond just waking your friends up. We envision its capability as a safety tracking application where trusted friends and relatives can ping you to make sure you are safe, requiring a form of response from you.
