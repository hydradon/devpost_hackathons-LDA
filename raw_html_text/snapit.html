                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved the idea of using image recognition to improve customers experience, although the technology is not quite there yet so we made a travel-inspired image recognition game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play in small groups of friends either in the same location or in different places. You are given 5 things to take pictures of, within one minute. The first one to get them all wins!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is an Android app. It communicates via socket.io to a node.js server that keeps track of the session and sync. The images are recognised using Google Cloud Vision API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the API with the Android was a challenge. We tried multiple APIs, settling with Google's for precision and generous trial plan. Multithreading caused some weird issues.
Addressing heavily nested objects took several attempts in node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no experience with node.js and socket.io we were surprised what we managed to achieve.
We were surprised to obtain a rather polished app after going through various designs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js and socket.io
Image recognition API's behave weirdly quite often. (e.g. sometimes pens are recognised as shotguns)
                </p>

                    What's next for SnapIt!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server now runs locally but we are planning to have it available on the cloud with multi-server support.
More game modes e.g. random group creation.
