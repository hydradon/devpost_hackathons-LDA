                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being girls in computer science, we decided to merge both of our passions together, programming and fashion. Sometimes it can be difficult to select a clothing item to wear on a specific day, so we wanted to create an efficient app that will decide what a person could wear on an everyday basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app scans the clothing items in a user's closet. From there it will store the clothing items into a database. Depending on the type of outfit the user wants to wear, it will randomly display an image of the outfit they should wear for that specific day. It will take into consideration the color of the outfit and whether or not it is patterned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first delved into Figma to create a markup of the app we wanted to create. We then programmed the ability to scan the outfits in a person's closet and identify the type of clothes it was along with its color by using Algorithmia. With the scanned information we created a json file that was used to read the information that was scanned. From there we used MongoDB to store the information from the scans into a database that was organized by id, type of clothing, color, and image address. We attempted to use fire base to store the images of the outfits that were scanned. After that we created a randomizer using JavaScript on notepad to help display and randomly select the outfit the user should wear for that specific day. We also used react-native to create the front-end portion of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us being freshman and attending our first hackathon, we faced several issues. We initially tried to create our database with cockroach db. We were able to create nodes, but it was difficult to store our data from the scanner into the cluster we created. So we transferred over to MongoDB and successfully put the information into our table. Another difficulty we faced was working on the front-end with react-native. We were able to create the buttons for the menu page but it was very hard for us to implement the camera that would be used to scan the clothes. In our GitHub repository we have the code that was attempted to create the camera but our markups will provide you with a better idea of where we wanted to place the camera. And finally another challenge we faced was merging all of these aspects together to create a workable app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we didn't create a workable app, we are proud of several aspects of the app we created. Firstly, we are proud about the markup design we created along with our logo. We are also proud about creating a workable scanner to scan the types of clothes the user owns in their closet. We are glad that we could use MongoDB to create the database for the app. Fourthly, we are happy that we could create the randomizer portion of the app. And finally we are glad that we could create at least one screen on react-native.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into HackUTD we didn't know what to expect. We were all freshman and we never had any experience with any of the applications we used to build our app. During the hackathon we researched on all of the applications we should use and learned the functionality of each application. We all collaborated and learned how each of the application worked and learned the syntax that is involved. We all learned a lot about the command prompt and the commands that we can use. We also learned how to use javascript. There were moments where we did feel like giving up especially since we were trying to get used to the software but instead of losing hope and quitting, we decided to work even harder and learn and grasp the knowledge. We never realized that we could learn this much and be equipped on the strategies that can be used to create an app. Surely this hackathon proved to us if one puts their mind to something they can learn a lot. We do not expect to win but we are glad and fortunate to have the opportunity to learn this much.

                    What's next for klo-kloset-organizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone on our team agrees that we will for sure continue working on our app. After the hackathon, we will analyze all of the stuff we finished so we can try and figure out how to merge each component to create a workable app. We will then create more front-end screens of the app. And eventually we hope that if we successfully create this app, we can try to add more features such as, weather and occasion, so the app can generate more options. If we are able to successfully implement these ideas, we hope that we can eventually put it on the app store.
