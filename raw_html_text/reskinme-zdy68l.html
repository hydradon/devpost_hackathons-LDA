                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Professor Spear

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple game with mechanics similar to flappy bird, but with unique collectibles and enemies. The concept is not focused on gameplay, but rather the theme of the game. Eventually we will support asset packs that will change the appearance of the game, creating unique experiences everytime!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Java, using Android Studio, with a gradle build system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git caused constant problems and was tough to work with. The library we built on top of was complex and had a lot of tools to learn in order to use it effectively.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built the base of what could eventually be the South Park of mobile apps!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use git better.

                    What's next for ReSkinMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generalize our implementation to allow for flexible asset packs to re-theme our game!
