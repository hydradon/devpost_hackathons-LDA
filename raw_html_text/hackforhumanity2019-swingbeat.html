                        West Coast Swing is a largely improvisatory dance form, descendent of 50&rsquo;s Lindy Hop
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aspiring competitive West Coast Swing dancer who needs a little help finding the "1" at times.

                        Dance movements often require knowledge of the specific beat count.

                    <li>
                        To find the &ldquo;1", that means we had to understand beat detection.

                        Where is the 1,2,3,4 in music?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We began an investigation of various algorithms in the context of our musical training and found a very complicated signal processing problem. It led to visualizations in virtual reality and a wearable solution.
