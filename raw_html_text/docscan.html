                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After experiencing many occasions where either my parents, friends, or I are faced with tons of receipts, valuable documents, and other papers and are unsure what to do. With Doc-Scan, a Data Management App, we are now able to simply title the document, scan it (picture), and download to our phones instead of digging through tons of documents.  As a matter of fact, one member of our team, Sasank Aduri, was denied access to a SoHacks5 computer for we did not have proper identification with us. This is actually where the hearth of our idea sparked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DocScan is an Andriod app which takes a picture(scan) of the document at hand and:
1) Names the Document, Date and Time
2) Saves it to the Android Device
3) Organizes it by time scanned
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the document is scanned, there will be an option to share the scan with messages, whatsapp, hangouts, gmail, yahoo, google photos, google plus, etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built DocScan by using MIT App Inventor 2 since it was a platform that many of us were familiar with, was more available to us at the time, seemed straightforward and hassle-free, and we could not attend Android App 
 Development APP class. We are using a AMAZON BLU Android Phone for this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many, many challenges along the way, here are a few:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) the app versions 4-19 would not operate due to a repeating command through our code. This took about 2 hours to de-bug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We could not download the MIT APP software on a select computer
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Asthetics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a functioning app which is aesthetically pleasing, practical, and is hassle-free. This was a miracle that we could pull this off in 24 hours as we are all beginner to intermediate hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this 24 hour process, we learnt how to work as a team and code efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DocScan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DocScan will add more photos per file and a name based organization setting. More Details on this will be provided in Presentation. The link below may not work as it is an app so if there are problems PLEASE contact us (room 400F) Sasank Aduri.
