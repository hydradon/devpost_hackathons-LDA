                    Our teammate Alex is the best freestyle rapper of all time, and we needed someone to challenge him. The only true rival to Alex is naturally, Alexa.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The user prompts Alexa to rap, and spits a sick bar. Alexa responds with a young bar of her own. And believe me, her bar ain't chips. It is intelligently formed around the user's verse, so as to roast them directly.
                </p>

                        Alexa takes the user's input and sends it to an ngrok server. We use flask to get the input and send it to the backend. A trigram tagger from the natural language toolkit analyses the input for important parts of speech such as prominent nouns and verbs. The datamuse API allows us to find words that are related to the important noun/verb from the user's rap. We then use a simple Context Free Grammar to generate two main phrases, using these rhyming words. The response is then sent back to the Alexa and communicated to the user.
