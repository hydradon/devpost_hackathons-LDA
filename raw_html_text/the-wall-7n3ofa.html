                    After the sixtyfourth world war, it has finally come to the end. Your mission, as God, is to botch the final remainin dispute of the last wondering souls of mankind. They still can't stand eachother, and you must
                    <em>
                        build the wall
                    </em>
                    to segregate souls of the same clan into a single bordered area. The catch is that if you build a wall, you can't dismantle it
                    <em>
                        unless
                    </em>
                    you leave a soul under it. A soul can be
                    <em>
                        resurreceted
                    </em>
                    by  demolishing its tombstone and while doing that it takes away some parts of the surrounding walls also.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the game advances, the levels get harder and harder. Amount of souls and amount of clans increase infinitely.
There's a global highscore for who has cleared the highest level.

                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We've been doing quite well in hackathons in general. This time we were simply out of ideas for the proposed tracks. We decided to do game jam as we've never done one. Our main idea was to come up with a simple but somewhat new gameplay idea.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ONE-DOES-IT-ALL tactics. We were abitious and chose the technology that wasn't the strongest one for our team. Eventually it lead into Juha doing all the hard work for implementation, and rest of us weren't able to help out at all. So it was built on pure perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never built a game with Unity, or practically any game before with level management / storyline. 1/3 of our team was able to do anything with Unity right away, so it offloaded too much work for single person. So we tried to come up with an original idea and make somewhat different gameplay, but didn't have time at all to actually wrap the GAME around it. At its current state our project remains as a proof-of-concept for an idea of a gameplay and not a fully featured game as we intended. Our algorithm to check the level clearance was actually too slow.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually implemented something that was planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is nice when you know it, and bitch when you don't. We learned that we should've made a cookie-clicker instead of aiming higher. It's good to be ambitious, but sometimes it's more satisfying to actually deliver something 100% working than delivering a half-baked product. Next time.. there's always one, we hope that we have better ideas that are easier to implement.
                </p>

                    Maybe, someday, make it to be what we intended it to be eventually, someday, maybe.
