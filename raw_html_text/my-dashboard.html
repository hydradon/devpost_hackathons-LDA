                    Since I'm

                        looking for an internship
                    </a>
                    this last period, I'm trying to improve my development skills and I think that a  real challenge is the best way to make it possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been a big user of Github, wikis and collaboration tools as Mozilla community member. 
I've recently discovered Confluence and Bitbucket and the possibility to make add-ons to personalize environment. 
All this combined pushed me to participate to the competition and work on something I like.
The first time I used Bitbucket, I've noticed the lacks on the main dashboard. Information are poor and it's very basic. That's why I decided to work on a plugin to customize Bitbucket's dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This plugin aims to improve Bitbucket's dashboard. No need to switch from the dashboard to the repository overview page to access to its settings or source or event to know if this project has an issue tracker or not. With the new "My Dashboard" addon you can have an overview of all these information in one place and more then that, you can see your repositories sorted by last update pushed or last created or simply in alphabetical order.

                    How I built it

                    Native web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS. The rest API of bitbucket.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most interesting challenge is to understand the whole ecosystem of Atlassian-projects and the addon interraction with a cloud system. And after that find the best way and idea that missed. Not only that, since the Atlassian-connect support was added recently to Bitbucket, it was for me a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it's my first Atlassian projects, I'm proud of my first addon.
Starting by a simple tweet to compare Github and Bitbucket API, I was surprised at how employees interact with the users.  This interest allowed me to report some improvements to the API and fixing a security access to the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I'm interrested in the community aspect through my contribution on Mozilla projects, I learned a lot of what a "profitble" company can do with open contribution side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Dashboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now the addon is showed in the profile sidebar menu. I'm discussing with Bitbucket employees for the possibility to  allow add-ons to "replace" parts of the Bitbucket UI so I can give to mine more logical behavior.
