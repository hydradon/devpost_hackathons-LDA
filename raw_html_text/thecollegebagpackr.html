                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "I wanted to attend ShellHacks so much that I traveled from a whole another continent. But with big travel plans come big prices. Travel is still considered a luxury in many parts of the world. This can be changed by allowing people to plan better and visualize their itenirary, and minimize the travel costs as much as possible."

                    With an all-in-one application that would supply you with the cheapest cost of travel for flights, transportation, and stay accommodations, we want the user to enjoy their vacation experience while we take care of the rest.

                    What the College Backpacker does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizes the traveling salesman algorithm to minimize the costs associated with local transportation and minizine the costs for flights using our own personal algorithm.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "College Backpacker" was built using Python, Selenium Webdriver, and Google Maps Driver API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was finding the correct APIs we wanted to retrieve flight information. We found Skyscanner's API but never heard a response after reaching out. This led us into web scraping using python scripts we created. Soon after running, we realized a CAPTCHA would activate instantly. This created a big roadblock that we eventually couldn't get past since of the strict regulations of cracking CAPTCHA.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to perform web scraping using selenium, an OS web-based automation tool that allowed us to pick dates, a destination, and retrieval of flight information. We also learned from NITRE, FCA, other hackers regarding web scraping.

                <p>
                    Utilize machine learning to predicate results of Skyscanner, Airbnb, and Uber/Lyft simultaneously while storing that information in a database to be learned and trained on.
