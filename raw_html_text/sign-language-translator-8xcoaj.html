                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something using the Glitch AI, and this is a useful real life application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python take the json file with the 2D dimensions of the hand joints, and then we filtered those points to the find the corresponding sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The filtration process is based on the process of elimination, by judging the relative distances between joints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first checked if any parts of the hands were touching, then we checked how many straight vertical fingers there are,
then how many straight horizontal fingers, and then we dealt with all the curled finger signs ( again filtered by which fingers were touching and how close they were).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were planning to hook up the sign translator with a GUI. Right now we print the result out on the console. We ran out of time.

                <p>
                    learning python in a day, and managing to differentiate between all the different signs and patterns
