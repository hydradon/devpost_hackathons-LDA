                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Party games, as well as any friendly competitive games, are wildly popular among people of all ages. By making a boxing game, people are enticed to compete with each other and ultimately have fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Oculus Rift we are able to virtually interact with a fully functioning punching bag, which interacts appropriately according to physics, to give an experience that is reminiscent of professional boxing. In addition to tracking hands using the Leap Motion, we track feet movements using the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C# and Unity were used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo was a new piece of hardware that was used, which led to many short term problems concerning appropriate usage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual Boxing has positional tracking that is normally only associated with the HTC Vive. This effect was able to be emulated using an Oculus Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Boxing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The addition of multiplayer (over LAN or the internet) is the next major goal.
