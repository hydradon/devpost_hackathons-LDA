                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You sit in front of the webcam and ask Alexa to give you a rating. In addition to your rating, it will give you a quality meme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Alexa interaction is connected to an AWS lambda function. The lambda function then interacts with a python flask server that connects to a HTML/JavaScript front end. This front end accesses the webcam to take a picture which is sent back to the flask server and go through the faceplusplus API to get rated. This rating is then sent back to the lambda server where it matches appropriate memes for Alexa to tell you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme girls sounds too much like Mean Girls and Alexa sometimes misunderstands us when we ask for a rate.
