                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was something I thought would be manageable in one day and be good learning experience for me. I wanted to use original art for the pieces as well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets two players play chess against each other. It does enforce rules with individual pieces (i.e. a bishop must go in diagonals). It does not track turns (white or black can go over and over). There is no castling and pawns do no transform if they make it to the other side. The same color pieces can take each other. This allows the players to make their own rules or play however they like. There is no check/checkmate, but the game will end if a king is taken.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All in Java with only my brain :)

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting some of the pieces to adhere to their rules was a nightmare. Did a lot of manipulation with a matrix which was frustrating, but rewarding when I finished.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The matrix for sure. I'm proud of myself for making something with graphics, with my friend's artwork, and that this was my idea outside of school.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How important nesting JPanels are. I initially tried to to do one frame, one panel. Learned real quick that was making it way to hard on myself. I didn't know JPanel could have their own Flow/BorderLayout.

                    What's next for Cat Chess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did want to get around to checking for check/checkmate, but I was running low on time. For Cat Chess 2.0, I would like to up the pixel sharpness a bit, add stats, ability to look back at each turn to analyze play and sounds.
