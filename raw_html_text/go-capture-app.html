                    Using various image processing techniques, but Hough Transform at the core. The code first finds the edges of the go board, and overlays a grid on top of the picture. Then by looking for circles (the stones) at each intersection of the grid, we find where pieces are on the grid. Finally we simply look at the color of the circles found in other to determine the side the piece is for.

                    From this digital representation, we can create whats called Smart Game Format (SGF) and submit to online servers in order to continue a game. If a user wishes to get a feel of who is winning in the game, or needs help scoring a finished game, we also have a score option that draws out which territories are under who's control. This is simply determined by the player surrounding an area with their pieces.
