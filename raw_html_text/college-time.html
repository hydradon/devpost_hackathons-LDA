                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by my classmate Jessica from Georgetown University who was the Director of Admissions for the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University at the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College Time answers questions about college admissions. Unlike the traditional admissions counselor, College Time is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is nonjudgemental and is accessible via voice making it easier for students to ask questions on demand.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was built using Amazon Skill Blueprints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into are getting users to test it out in order to develop the idea further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create an Alexa skill, have it published, and to embark on the voice user interface (VUI) adventure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that creating a VUI skill is not as difficult as we first thought.  We also learned that it takes planning, customer UX focus and creativity to make a useful and fun skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on developing this skill for high school students and are partnering up with a local high school in Silicon Valley to further develop the skill.
