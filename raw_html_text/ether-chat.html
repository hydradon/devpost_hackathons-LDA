                    Imagine you're in a country that has a suppression of free speech and the government actively censors information. A method of communication that can't be altered by government would be necessary to communicate freely without suppression. We built this service on top of the Ethereum blockchain using a variety of web services such as JavaScript and React. It was difficult to configure the apis properly, but we managed to get it working. We learned a lot more about web development and we would like to move this service to mobile applications.
