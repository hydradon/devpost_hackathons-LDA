                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a tool to help people. We also want to be Iron Man. Thus, BraceX was born
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BraceX is an exoskeleton that will assist people in allowing them to lift weights without high strain on the joints. By reading the user's intentions from pressure switches attached to either end of the wrist, the BraceX moves with you to assist you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a high-torque motor, 3D printed gears and arm attachments, and aluminum rods, we built the mechanical aspects of the BraceX. Using a simple Arduino Nano, a motor controller, a LiPo battery, and pressure switches, we built the electrical system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted the product to be light weight yet strong, powerful yet sleek. To do this we used a high torque motor, light aluminum and 3D printed parts, and thick arm attachments to provide comfort and strength.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make the BraceX comfortable, effective and aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about integration and creating products for direct human interaction
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BraceX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future iterations we would use more powerful motors, potentially two motors to provide more power, and more comfortable and ergonomic attachments to the body.
