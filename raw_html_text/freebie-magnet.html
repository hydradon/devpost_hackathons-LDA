                <p>
                    Who doesn't like free swag?!? That's the only reason I attend hackathons...

                        (seriously though):
                    </em>
                    Every day, new headlines and events tear people and communities apart; socially through differing political views, and even physically through an increasing frequency of natural disasters.
Freebie Magnet hopes to bring communities back together through the one thing no one can turn down: free stuff. By tracking events with free swag near you, Freebie Magnet hopes to "attract" communities back together through the power of freebies.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we used Firebase for our database.

                    In addition to adding more features, including a rating system for each organization, we hope to begin porting the web application into Android and Swift for iOS.
