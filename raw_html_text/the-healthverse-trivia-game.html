                    Inspired by UN goal #3: Good health and well-being, Healthverse seeks to inform users about mental health, the challenges faced by those afflicted with it and the stigma surrounding these subjects. With the help of a Glitch group application, we designed Healthverse with simplistic boxes and text in order to not confuse players that may suffer from anxiety and related disorders.
Building it was certainly a challenge. In-depth and well-sourced information gathering topped with random system glitches took up most of our allotted time. We abandoned a few ideas for the sake of time saving, but we worked through it with the help of several volunteers and the internet. What made this project the most difficult was that none of us had any previous experience in JavaScript, although Healthverse heavily employs it. 
We learned a lot about psychology along the way, but we hardly even scratched the surface of such a broad topic. This project can hopefully inform more people about the topic, just as it helped us. We hope revisit this project soon to add more information, clarity, as well as a more visually calming design.
