                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is a drive to return to the present organic reality. The focused attention span for humans is now

                    than a goldfish, due to online distractions. Paired with the earths carrying capacity and exponential consumption we need to change our collective behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Insight into how to do this can be found in behavioural economics; the very tool used by massive cooperations to decimate our attention by optimising for short term incentives - likes, swipes and fiat currency. Further inspiration can be found from the legends of complex/integral thinking (the label keeps changing); Gurdijieff, Buckminster Fuller, Ken Wilbur and Jacque Fresco.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system being designed intends to co-opt short term extractive behaviour into long term resilience for people and planet via a triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. We want to out compete (hyper)capitalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More concretely we do this by scoping, measuring and iterating on experiments from the bottom up (mycellia network - grass is a biological desert that nothing grows in). These roots have been bootstraped in a place called
                    <a href="liminalvillage.com" rel="nofollow">
                        Liminal Village
                    </a>
                    via a memetic unit called
                    <a href="hackalong.io" rel="nofollow">
                        hackalongs
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    This first iteration deploys a splitter contract that accepts inputs and divides funding into three streams; personal, local and global. Personal streams are intended as personal funds - a UBI stream, a project stream and an excess stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We split the pie (funds/resources) on the streams via a monthly proposal process which deploys a splitter. Personal streams are transferred directly to your personal wallet. Local streams go to a community DAO which uses liquid pledging to allocate funds into internal projects (like
                    <a href="co-budget.co" rel="nofollow">
                        co-budget
                    </a>
                    ). The global stream is for when personal and local streams reach their cap, when this happens excess overflows into ecosystem partner DAOs.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Agile methodology. The present iteration is built on Ethereum as a simple first iteration. Further upgrades upon testing will be completed in future (moon based) sprints.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Divergent thoughts and world views, semantics and over conceptualisation when scoping was needed.

                    Scope creep is the infinity that poisons all concepts. Ship.
