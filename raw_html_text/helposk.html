                        Boston has one of the highest populations of homelessness and we felt that shelters and others resources have a limited amount of health items to give out. We created kiosks called Helposks that dispense 3 items per week to people that need it in order to prevent illness and improve health outcomes.

                    <li>
                        Shelters will have a sign up for the homeless. These sign ups will allow the homeless to create their own login to get into Helposks anywhere across Boston to receive weekly items. Then after logging into their account, there will be an option of 3 items you may choose from. There will be a short video about staying informed about one's health and then the bundle will dispense.

                        We created a website to exhibit how the kiosks work and why we wanted to create this program. We used Weebly as an outlet to display what the Helposks would distribute and how the homeless would access the Helposks. We used Adobe ID and Sketch to create a prototype of the innerface and the actual representation of the innerface that would be in the Helposks.

                        Creating a platform in which we wanted to put a prototype of our idea of the Helposks and make it become a reality.

                        We are proud that we created a piece of technology that is accessible to those in need and will have 24-hour access to sanitary and preventative health materials.

                        67% of homeless individuals are living with at least one preventable illness, this is partly due to lack of access to resources for the homeless population. Despite Right to Shelter Laws that are currently in place, there has been an overflow of individuals which has lead to a steady increase in the use emergency shelters. With an overflow of people with inadequate access, there is a need to create equal and equitable access to care. This calls for the implementation of programs to assist with this demand and enables the care that is needed to be accessible to everyone; the Helposk is an innovative provision that will combat this demand.

                        We hope to implement these Helposks throughout Boston in order to help the homeless have access to preventative health needs to improve the lives of thousands.
