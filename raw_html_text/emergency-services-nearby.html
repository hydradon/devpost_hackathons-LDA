                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Google Maps feature of 'places near me'.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The startup page displays a list of emergency service types. After the user chooses one, a map is displayed showing the emergency services of that type that are nearby. The list view can also be chosen by clicking the list view tab at the bottom of the page. Upon clicking any one of them, it leads them to a separate page that contains all details of the service.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to program the application

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we did android programming, and we had to teach Java to ourselves before diving into programming the app. Learning the language, and also, learning to use the Google Maps IDE and incorporating it into our application was a major challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a running application on our laptop and almost perfected the

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learnt how to customize the characteristics of the objects on our app.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking it further, we want to have an Emergency Services database for multiple countries in the world, instead of just in Canada.
