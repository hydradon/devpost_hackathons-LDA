                    Multiple models (logistic model, SVC, Naive Bayes, etc.) were built to analyze data on student engagement in the classroom, with metrics such as number of times they raised their hands and how often they visited online resources. The data can be found here:

                    The goal of this project was to analyze this data to predict the final metric of student performance as a function of these variables. We were able to create models with about 79% accuracy for predicting student performance.
