                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build something simple for my first hackathon based on the information I acquired over the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides 2 user-inputted numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the C language and Sublime Text editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my one of the first programs I wrote, it was took some time to write and fix the compilation errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to hone my skills in the C language and get some good practice out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there is not a single right way to do something in computer science. A programmer can take many different approaches to solve a problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I will be able to program it so that it can do more functions in the future, but I am looking to go into more complex things.
