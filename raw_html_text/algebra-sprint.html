                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being mainly backend developers, we thought that it would be interesting to work on a front end hack and the type of project that we were immediately drawn to was a game. We knew that JavaScript was good for making web games, so we discovered ways to generate shapes and other requirements for a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user controls a character that attempts to avoid oncoming enemies. The user is allowed to touch green platforms (and must do so to survive), but is not allowed to touch red platforms. The series of oncoming obstacles are randomly generated and continue infinitely until the user loses. The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using JavaScript and the Phaser.js game framework. We generated the character and then developed a system to generate oncoming obstacles and a jumping system so the character can avoid the enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble generating the green platforms that the user could land on. It was difficult to make the platform move while keeping the user in place, all while maintaining the physics of the game. It also took a long time to develop a system that randomly generates obstacles that are still solvable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the game works well, with no bugs (that we know of). The game is also very challenging so it takes a large amount of concentration and quick thinking to achieve a high score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about frontend development, especially with JavaScript. This was the first time any of us had worked on a game, and it turned out very well. It was a good introduction to game development and working with JavaScript.
