                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had experience with lending money to friends and family. It's usually a super awkward experience that ends up being set aside and procrastinated. We have also experienced lending that money and not receiving it back! We need a solution to this situation. We know it is a common problem because of the estimates of how much money is lent to friends and family in the United States ranges between $89bn-180bn. That's a big market!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App/website where users can agree on the terms of the loan and generate an electronic promissory note. The app/website will be in charge of handling money transfers and payments. The app/website will also be in charge of having payment reminders and updates on the loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the communication we&rsquo;ll provide along with having clear terms will make the borrower more likely to pay.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now we started working on a website for the app, the actual design of the app, and a business plan. The website was built using react. The design of the app was made using AdobeXD. We also started working in a business plan for this idea.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges involved creating a user experience that promoted both trust and simplicity. Also, it was a bit overwhelming to learn about the process of forming a startup. There are a lot of laws and regulations pertaining to financial companies! Calculating the costs of the startup was another big challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely proud of coming up with a simple proof of concept and the beginnings of a business plan we will hopefully need in the future.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of business stuff! We also polished our development and UI/UX skills
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully find a mentor that can guide us, finish the business plan, and create a mvp. We already researched the technologies and apis we will use to implement this project, so we just need to keep hacking away!
