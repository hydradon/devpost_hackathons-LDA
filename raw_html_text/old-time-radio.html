                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy listening to old radio shows and I thought Alexa would be the perfect device to hear them on. I wanted the skill to be immersive - featuring authentic vintage commercials to help with immersion. The ultimate goal was to transport the listener back to simpler times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Old Time Radio lets users listen to back-to-back vintage radio shows. The user can either choose the show, or listen to shows from one of the genres. After each show, a vintage commercial is played - followed by the next episode, or show from a genre.
If a user has not subscribed to ISP, they will also hear a promotional message in-between shows. Subscribing to ISP removes the message and also allows the user to continue a show - even after listening to another audio skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally built this as a self-hosted skill using PHP on a rented VPS. The original did not feature ISP and was one of the first skills I had written for the Alexa. As I continued to develop my skills on the Alexa, I knew it was time to upgrade.
I built this new version in NodeJS and it is now an Alexa-hosted skill. A MySQL database is used to store audio info for premium subscribers.
Audio shows are sourced from
                    <a href="https://archive.org" rel="nofollow">
                        Archive.org
                    </a>
                    .
Audacity and GarageBand were used to produce some of the speech audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hadn't used NodeJS before, so this was a challenge, but also fun to learn. Using AWS resources was also challenging, yet rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a skill that I actually use myself on a daily basis.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so much. Having previously developed self-hosted skills, learning to deploy skills as Alexa-hosted, has seriously cut down my development time and resources, opening up possibilities for many future skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Old Time Radio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It could be nice to enable some sort of rating system for a show, then show a list of the most recommended shows to users.
