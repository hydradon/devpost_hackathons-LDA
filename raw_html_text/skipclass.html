                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For students who are hard-of hearing and when students can't focus on learning the content in lectures while taking notes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Records the voice of the professor during the lecture and actively updates a note for the lecture which can be accessed by a website. Allows the option to copy the note, make it into an email, and generate a text file for future use.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with Amazon Alexa but soon realized that its limitations would stop us from being able to record voices - so we decided to use the Google web speech api and implemented the front-end solution using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At early stages of development, we were unfamiliar with the under-documented limitations of the hardware and software choices that we made, so as a team we decided to do independent research among ourselves to find the best solution fitting our blueprint.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to implement the final functioning front-end satisfying our original plan
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuing to add more features such as quick search after a lecture to find quick information about the topic as well as a summarizing algorithm to summarize the whole lecture to a quick summary easy for the user to understand. Finally, we wish to add formatting features such as putting it in paragraphs
