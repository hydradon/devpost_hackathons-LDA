                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to invoke great communication between two people, whether that be friends, partners, or family members. With this lovely, two-persons game, the players can improve their relationships since they can build on the trust of each other by completing the maze missions together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a Virtual Reality game which requires one player to see through the VR glasses, and the other player to control the movement of the character in the game. The player with the VR glasses will need to give clear instructions to the other player with the controller in order to walk to the end of the maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it primarily with Google's Firebase, a mobile application development platform, which takes part in the mobile controller. With the VR part of the game, we used Unity to create the maze environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, it was hard to compile the Unity codes to the mobile phone. However, with our patience and problem-solving skills, we eventually made the game working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that our team could learn how to use Unity and create a game from scratch within 36 hours since no one on the team had experience with Unity and Firebase beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity and Firebase. Also, we further improved our interpersonal skills, i.e. teamwork. People tend to be more emotional when working at night and pulling all-nighters. Nonetheless, we were able to control our emotions and created a game together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Our Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since there was a time limit, Our Game is not in its fullest potential yet. If there is more time allowed in the future, our team will add more details and features to further enhance the users' experience with the game.
