                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I use calendar or notification applications to remind me of due dates, I often end up getting reminded within an hour before the task is 'due', and I end up not being able to accomplish it on time. To avoid this, I'll often set an event in my calendar a week or so before the task is due, to remind me preemptively. But there's no reason that I would need to start working on the project at that particular moment, so I often end up resetting another notification for another time, and meanwhile my calendar becomes cluttered with misinformation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application thinks about managing todo's in a manner similar to the way agile software development teams manage tasks: We focus on what we should be doing next. We calculate a priority for all the tasks entered in our system by comparing the estimated time it would take to accomplish the task, to the amount of time before the task is due. By visualizing tasks as a color coded list, with the most urgent tasks at the top, the user can see where his or her time would be best spend, and can quickly track progress and reorder the list on the fly.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all wanted to try out iOS development, so we used the iOS sdk to develop our code. We also deployed a small website with a domain name provided by domain.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being newcomers to iOS development, we had some trouble with iOS SDK patterns. Some strange UI bugs hung us up for a little while, but we never painted ourselves into a corner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built our first iOS app. I like the idea for the app enough that I'd actually use it. Also, one of our team members (currently a middle school student) built his first website!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS is cool. Color coding can be useful, but it might hurt your app's aesthetic. Mathematically organizing a schedule is harder than it sounds. Close your html tags!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Agile Tasker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of our team is actually interested in using the app, and we've already thought of some ways to extend its functionality further to make it an even more powerful tool. I think it will become an ongoing pet project.
