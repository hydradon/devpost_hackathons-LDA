                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was no previous Alexa skill that was working for getting cta bus times
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells you when the next bus will be arriving. Currently only works for one bus stop but given more time, we could easily incorporate all bus stops. In order to get it to work you have to say or type the following, "tell cta bus tracker to get next bus."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using java, Chicago's transit Api, and Amazons aws.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First idea we had was too ambitious so we had to switch gears and start on a new project. 
On this project, we had no experience working with Amazon's aws or Alexa skills so that posed a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to work with Alexa skills and the different API's and actually having it work.
                </p>

                    What's next for ctaBusTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including bus times for all buses in Chicago as currently we only have it programmed for one bus stop.
