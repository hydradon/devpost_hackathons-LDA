                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to WearHacks, we were inspired by the variety of hardware available for us to use. At first, we wanted to use Oculus Rift and Leap Motion together to create a virtual reality application, but learning Unity proved to be too complicated for us. We ultimately decided on focusing our attention on Leap Motion in combination with Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a world with increasing emphasis on convenience, gesTEXT aims to send text with simple hand gestures. gesTEXT captures specific hand gestures, transcribing them into text and sending the text to a mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    gesTEXT was coded based on open source materials written in JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. The Leap Motion Controller was used to sense specific hand gestures, and Twilio&rsquo;s services were used to send text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge was trying to implement JavaScript HTML, and PHP. Also, the gesture recognition of Leap Motion was too sensitive. For instance, a swipe was mistakenly identified as a circle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of being able to understand the logic behind Leap Motion. Learning how to set up a local server to run our program was also a great experience. Overall, discovering different ways to complete a complicated task boosted our confidence as computer programmers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of creating gesTEXT, we learned how to use Twilio and setting up the server. Along the way, we also picked up a bit of JavaScript and understood how to use the data obtained by the Leap Motion Controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gesTEXT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After successfully sending a basic text message and image, gesTEXT aims to perform more advanced tasks, such as sending recorded audio.
