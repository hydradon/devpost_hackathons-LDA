                    Connects businesses and customers to reduce waste using Twilio.
Businesses can notify the community about sale offers simply by sending a text message. For example, restaurants can offer reduced prices before it closes for the day; grocery stores can post about cardboard/wood boxes they may be throwing away. Meanwhile, customers can search for these offers within a zip code area that they specify, again, through a text, and receive a text of a list of sale offers and resources giveaway that's available in their area.

                    Develop a visual recognition system such that it lists out the products within a photo when businesses send photos of offered/on sale products. This will facilitate offer postages by the business.
Additionally, a feature that helps customers is in development. We plan to create a system such that the customers sends a list of products and a zip code in order to receive the list of offerings related to those products within the specified zip code. This way, the customers not only have a grocery list available but will also be able to plan which store they may want to go depending on the offers.
