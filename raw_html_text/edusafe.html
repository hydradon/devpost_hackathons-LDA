                    What it does: On the front end students and faculty/staff will fill out emergency information. Then let&rsquo;s say an intruder with a gun is caught on surveillance the surveillance will first notify via text faculty/staff and then they have to text back a &lsquo;y&rsquo; for yes. The reason faculty/staff contact first is because we don&rsquo;t want to create panic within students. Then if majority of faculty/staff respond then notify police. Then contact students and have them also respond &lsquo;y&rsquo; for yes if shooting is true and tell them police are on the way. If the surveillance did detect intruder then its trust score goes up. If faculty/staff was also correct trust score goes up. If student also correct their trust score goes up. Otherwise if false trust score go down. Trust score will factor in when we decide to notify or not.

                    How we built it: We first built the gun detection. Then we built the blockchain and then we built the front end!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We had issues building the blockchain and coming up with the hierarchy of who validates first. We also had issues with twilio because we only had a a 15 dollar limit.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We are proud that we pulled through and made a solution to a national crisis. We are also really proud that we are able to function on almost no sleep haha!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned so much about blockchain and how to implement it and how to use twilio to contact specific persons. And majority of us never used google platform before and we learned how to navigate it and use the google cloud vision!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EduSafe: We hope to create an even better trust system and structure the hierarchy more. And add additional functionality for twilio (we were limited because it cost money to use).
