                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday in the news there are talks of disastrous and world altering events. It can leave us feeling lost and powerless, as if we can't do anything to change the world. We wanted to show people how their decisions have an impact on the world around them, and that they can make a positive difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This simulation takes you through the routine of an average college student, and how their decisions impact the environment. It gives the user multiple choices, the results of those choices, and the option to go back and make another decision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python because that is the language that my group was most comfortable with. We used multiple if-else statements for the decisions, and while loops to allow the user to go back if they wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give this simulation some life with pictures, and we tried to incorporate HTML to make the simulation more appealing. Unfortunately, none of knew how to accomplish this.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group stayed focused and worked together even when we were unsure of what to do. This was our first hackathon, and we manged to do what we set out to accomplish. We had fun, which was the most important part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should prepare more for the hackathon, and that we should do more planning before it starts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Day in Your Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to learn how to use HTML and CSS when we have the time, which will take our code to the next level. We will also continue our computer science education, learning more that will help us next year.
