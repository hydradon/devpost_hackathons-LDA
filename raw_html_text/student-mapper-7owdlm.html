                    The inspiration for this Android Application came from the simple need of integrating two necessary resources of everyday life- schedule of courses and the locations of each class. As a first time hacking group it was indeed a challenge in creating the application from what software that will be used to an unfamiliarity with Java, Git, and API's as well as many difficult obstacles from learning the interface of Android Studio, trying to find a way to put a list view in the MainActivity.xml and not in console.xml, how to create a new activity and connect that to a button push, learning how to incorporate an API into one's own code, and many more which have made me improve on my own programming skills and has given me a rewarding a meaningful experience despite creating something that did not meet our team's expectations, we believe that HackDavis will be the first in many stepping stones that will lead us to a path of success.
