                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The quadrupeds at Boston Dynamics were our inspiration in designing this robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has two different walking gaits as well as exact coordinate movement for singular legs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did the hardware over the summer. It was built from scratch in my basement and we wired and programmed it today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent hours troubleshooting the wiring. In the end it turns out the problem was a bad breadboard. We also ran into numerous programming challenges, most of which were syntax errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly the accomplishment I am most proud of was figuring out the breadboard issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our whole team learned a lot about Arduino, programming robots, and electronics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robot Spider
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I definitely plan to add some sensors as well as refining the hardware. After that I plan to optimize the walking programs and eventually get it to climb stairs.
