                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SIPR keeps track of your can. The web page shows you how much you've had to drink and when you drank it. The koozie has a display which both shows your drink count and flashes party lights.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SIPR uses an accelerometer to determine when you're drinking. The accelerometer also knows when you finish a can by detecting a double tap. We used a PSoC to control the electronics. It communicates with the web page through a laptop for the demo.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered some problems getting our hardware to work. We had to learn a lot of new skills to get stuff done.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Everyone on the team learned a new language or two. Python, Javascript, HTML to name a few.
