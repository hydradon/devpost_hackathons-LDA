                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide users with an experience that allows them to view the world from a new perspective while enjoying the thrill of a combat game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user's hand becomes a UFO that must dodge bullets while firing at soldiers and tanks below and avoid getting hit by the attack helicopters surrounding it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and assets from the Unity Store to assemble our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble spawning objects in correct places and syncing everything up together in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    We're proud of finishing the project and creating a game that both looks good and has a smooth and engaging game-play.

                <p>
                    We learned how to work with new technology as a team and use innovation to create a fun shooter game that we're proud of!
