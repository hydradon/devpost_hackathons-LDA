                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked adventure games and we got our inspiration from Lifeline. It was like a choose your own adventure style.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a story and with every choice you make, you get a slightly different ending.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make the game into a web game so we decided to make the format in HTML and then incorporated Javascript into it to make the game a interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult writing the story line and creating the different buttons with the various results. Also, at first we were using Python because that's what we all knew. But it was hard using Python in HTML so we were forced to learn and use Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the format and that fact we actually got the game to be interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned tons about Javascript and how to use it in HTML.

                    What's next for Savior/html
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design, artwork and backgrounds. I also think animations and sounds should be incorporated.
