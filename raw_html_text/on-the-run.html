                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a combination of a roadtrip app and a game. The escape element just made it more interesting, and as the context developed, the factors and elements of the game started to take shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OTR is a text-based game, with just a web UI to guide gameplay. The player starts with $200, with an objective to last as long as possible and save as much money as possible. However, low-cost flights often lead to more dangerous destinations, which also leads to higher monetary incentive, so the player has to find the balance between risking being caught and getting some dollar bills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with pure HTML/CSS and Javascript code, and when putting them together, refactored it to become a React app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many kinks to iron out during the integration of front and back end, which was made even harder as the other half of my team had to leave for family matters! But the integration was done and the app is built :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing and implementing the app from start to finish, and proud to have discovered and explored this idea after discarding many ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games aren't that hard to make!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for On The Run
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully extending it to live on a website where many can enjoy :)
