                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the personal stories that provide richness and depth to a location. Personal stories are the difference between seeing a place and experiencing the culture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to upload personal audio stories and connect them to a certain location. Users should then be able to listen stories that are relevant to a particular place. The app can then act as an audio guide that clues users into the culture and mythology around a location.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an initial mockup website using javascript about how the entire platform will function

                    We are in the process of making an app that'll connect people and stories. We've received our first recording right here at Yhack!
