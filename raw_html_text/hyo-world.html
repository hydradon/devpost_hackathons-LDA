                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Sound is a precious thing. Unfortunately, some people are unable to experience as a result of hearing loss or of being hearing impaired. Although, we firmly believe that communication should be as simple as a flick of the wrist and we aim to bring simplicity and ease to those affected by hearing loss and impairment.  
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HYO utilizes hand gesture input and relays it to an Android powered mobile device/ or PC. The unique set of gestures allow a user to select a desired phrase or sentence to communicate with someone using voice over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HYO = Hello + Myo 
We used the C++ programming language to write the code for the PC to connect to the MYO and recognize the gestures in a multilevel menu and output instructions. We developed the idea to create and deploy an Android app for portability and ease of use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered several challenges along the way while building our project. We spent large amounts of time troubleshooting code issues. The HYO was programmed using the C++ language which is complex in its concepts. 
After long hours of continuous programming and troubleshooting, we were able to run the code and connect the MYO to the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Not sleeping and working productively.
2) Working with in diverse group of four who are four complete strangers and being able to collaborate with them and work towards a single goal of success despite belonging to different programs and having completely different skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Github is an extremely valuable tool.
2) Learnt new concepts in C++
3) Experience working with the MYO armband and Arduino and Edison micro-controllers.
4) How to build an Android app
5) How to host a website
                </p>

                    What's next for HYO WORLD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HYO should be optimized to fit criteria for the average technology consumer. Hand gestures can be implemented to control apps via the MYO armband, a useful and complex piece of technology that can be programmed to recognize various gestures and convert them into instructions to be executed.
