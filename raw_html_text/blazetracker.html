                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As climate change continues to affect all of us as time goes on, people in California have felt the effects directly. We wanted to help alleviate the problem of local wildfires that displace hundreds of people in California by providing a service to connect those directly affected with people in their community willing to open up their homes to those in need. We believe that community is an integral part of moving through hardships, and we wanted to utilize technology to take the best advantage of a community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to create an account to connect them with those living around them. People that are affected by the fires can use the interactive map to get live updates on the severity of the fires near them, as well as other useful information for evacuation and protocol. Those unaffected can open up their homes to provide refuge for people evacuating and post a listing on the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using MIT App Inventor. This programming environment allowed us to use block-based tools to create an interactive Android App and implement the necessary features we intended our app to have by using design tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While creating this app, we were challenged by the database used to store the information about new account users. We were also challenged by coming up with the best way to use technology to solve the problem we were addressing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to design a functional user interface as well as design aspects of the app. We designed the layout and logo of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use block-based programming to create a functional android app. We also learned more about how databases work and how to store information in the long term, as well as how to connect a username to a password.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlazeTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to learn more about database usage so that we can successfully create accounts on the app. We would want to work on getting live updates on fires, as well as possibly opening up our app to other locations and for other natural disasters.
