                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built an Alexa skill that would engage the user through a simple word game. This project was inspired by a childhood game called First Letter, Last Letter. The objective of this game is for the user to say a word ie.hacker, and for your opponent to say a word that begins with the last letter of the previous word ie.response. As the user continues their success in the game, Alexa will respond faster, prompting the user to increase the speed of their answers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wake Amazon Alexa and call the skill saying &ldquo;Alexa, open Word Chain game."
Alexa will explain the instructions of the game, choose a category and start the game with the user.
