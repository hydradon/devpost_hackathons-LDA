                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the ignorance and indifference we have observed around recycling items such as plastic bottles. So we decided to build an app to raise awareness of how different items should be disposed of, and their impact if not recycled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to take photos of items, and the app will display information about objects it identifies within the photo, explaining to the user how to recycle the item and a fact about its carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Java using android studio. For the image recognition we linked in Google's Cloud Vision API, which identified some labels relevant to the image. From these labels we check for a relevant label which we can display a pop up dialog with the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technical challenges of linking the API, such as filtering the result to eliminate background noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was no online database available with information of how each item is recycled, so we started constructing our own fact file of this information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that the impact of producing items was far greater than we thought and didn't realise the scale to which items were not recycled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recyqlo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would hope to expand the range of objects the app works on and create our own database with information on how each item can be properly disposed.
