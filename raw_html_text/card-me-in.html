                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year, we had too many meal points, and this year, we wanted more meal points. As a busy student, cooking is hard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Users can create an account and advertise their meal points.

                <p>
                    Learning Flask took some time. Creating a finalized design was difficult.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What's next for card-me-in
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the functionality of our app by allowing users to see other users' ratings as well as allow communication and a method of payment between users.
