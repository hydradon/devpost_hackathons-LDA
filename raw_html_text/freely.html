                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memes are the new thing taking over the internet. So why not build a social media messaging apps such as Snapchat and Instagram
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme2Go is a social media/messaging app built around Microsoft Azure's platform whose main feature is taking a photo of the user and analyzing the facial expressions in this photo using Microsoft's Vision API. Meme2Go then determines what captions would be funny for this photo, creates a meme using this text, and then uploads it to a social media stream or messages this image to a friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Microsoft Azure's platform to take the photos. Microsoft Vision API got incorporated to detect the user's facial expressions.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    This is the first time I've worked with an API so most of the troubles came from implementing it.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme2Go currently saves all posts locally rather than on the Microsoft Azure database. We would like to further develop Meme2Go so images can be sent to other app users as well as posted into a social media stream
