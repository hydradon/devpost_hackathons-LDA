                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help people overcome phobias in order to live more fulfilling lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It exposes participants to increasingly intensive exposures to phobias in a controlled environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created separate scenes in Unity for every level of intensity for different phobias. We linked them together with a main menu and programmed interactions between the participant and the virtual reality to help them overcome their phobia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first experience with Unity and VR and XR development so we had to do a lot of self-learning throughout the 36 hours. We also did not have a lot of experience with C# and we had some difficulties at the beginning learning to use C# with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The graphics were something we spent a lot of time on and represent the effort we made to learn to utilize Unity. We are also proud of the sound effects we created for this therapy program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in C# and use Unity to create VR programs. We learned how to connect Oculus Rift to run these programs and the fundamentals of VR development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phobia Exposure Therapy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop our program to incorporate more phobias and more realistic exposures to be able to help more people.
