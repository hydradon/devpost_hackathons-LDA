                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, people are afraid of the stock market because it seems intimidating and like too much of a risk because they can't keep track of what they've invested in, let alone figure out what are good stocks to buy in the future. Our applications aim to solve this fear by not only helping people keep track of the stocks they've purchased, but also to provide guidance on which stocks are best to buy next, based on things like market cap, trends, and the affordability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does and How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both the web and mobile applications communicate via their Firebase backend to persist the stocks already purchased and also utilize the Yahoo finance API to gather and analyze real-time data of the stock market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with Firebase since both of use were previously familiar only with Parse. Additionally, Yahoo provided a variety of APIs, each with only part of the data we needed, leading to difficulty to choose which one to use. Lastly, we spent a lot of time discussing what should and shouldn't go into creating the algorithm to select which stocks are a good buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to create an application accessible over two platforms with only two people making up our team. We are also proud of our persistence and resilience in the face of challenges that arose.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both learned a lot about our respective platforms; for example, I learned how to use a structured query language (YQL). However, we both learned a new platform. I've always wanted to get into web development as an iOS developer, and I got an opportunity to see the basic ideas I have read in books and in tutorials being used in practice.
                </p>

                    What's next for Finance Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue developing the algorithm to select the best stock to buy. Specifically, we want to further look at how the number of shares relates with the market capital of a company, and how that affects the stock price, how we can incorporate data outside of the stock market to influence our suggestions, and use a larger scope with our historical data to get a better idea of the trends a stock will face in the future.
