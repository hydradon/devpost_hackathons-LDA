                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with this idea a while back when I got frustrated with all the paper ads in the commons at Rice. It's not only a waste of paper, but also is a hassle to distribute, and is left weeks after it's relevance expires. I thought of it as a cool exercise to teach myself Android programming, and it came up again as the inspiration for our hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's divided into two applications. The first one will be the billboard itself, which is an app that takes the data from a Google Drive folder and displays all the advertisements with a horizontally scrolling screen. The final product will respond to updates in the folder in the appropriate order, and remove them if they correspond to an event once it expires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second is an application that handles the content in the Google Drive folder. It has two levels of access: users who can submit content, and admins who can submit and curate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collectively used Android Studio and tested it on my Samsung Tablet for a proof-of-concept demonstration. We used Google Drive's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody on the team had any prior experience in Android programming, making every step of progress a struggle. At the end of the hackathon, we were unable to implement the next-level functionality of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement an E-Billboard that would display all of the images in a folder. More importantly, we all learned a significant amount about Android programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for E-Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the higher-level functions of both applications and integrating them. Next goals would be categorizing advertisements as an interest group/club or an event, improving the UI by organizing fliers by popularity and relevance, migrating the second application to a webpage, and gathering analytics from the app and webpage usage to provide user feedback.
