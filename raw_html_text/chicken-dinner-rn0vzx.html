                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends are very much addicted to the Popular game PUBG, so I decided to develop a filter that they and all the fans worldwide can enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an Instagram filter that gets you into the character of the layer from the Battle Royal game. The Face-tracking and Augmented Reality can the Effect to come to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This filter was built using Facebook's easy to use Spark AR kit. I had to get the correct 3d model for the helmet that resembles the character's from the game. Designed other HUD elements using photo-editing software. Finally, imported it all to Spark AR, positioned the 3d models correctly and tracked them to the face. The effect was ready!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge that I encountered was that I was unable to save my project after importing a particular 3d model. All my work got wasted and had to start again. At last, I had to resolve using another similar looking model.
Another challenge I ran into was to fix the issues with textures displaying incorrectly for newly imported models.
Also, it was the first time I had used Spark AR, so I had to learn all the ins and outs of this software from scratch, but it was fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to develop this without much past knowledge of how to create my own AR app. Also, the main achievement would be that I completed my app in time because I got to know about this hackathon a little late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use Spark AR, edit 3d models and how to publish Facebook and Instagram filters for the world to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chicken Dinner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main improvements that I would like to make to this filter are the addition of some animations or some particle effects to make this filter stand out.
