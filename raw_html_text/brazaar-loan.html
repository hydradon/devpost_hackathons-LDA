                    After journeying through multiple decentralized marketplaces, we can across one that had a large enough eco-system, but a few financial limitations. We thought about how we could contribute to this marketplace by integrating a system that allows for more communal transactions.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's nothing bizarre about Bazaar Loans. We allow for a crowd-funding type loan system, which gives OB users the option to support their favorite merchants. Not only does this give legitimate merchants a helping hand, but also increase a well established economic and social system.
