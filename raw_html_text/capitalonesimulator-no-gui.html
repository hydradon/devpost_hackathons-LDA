                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had the inspiration of making something to see how the capital system worked. Unfortunately due to time, I was not able to make my own database and import everything from Capital One.  So I used their server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It basically creates customers, accounts, purchases, transfers,gathers the data and does a simulation that can run for a while.  If I had access to the backend (if had time to import... Almost done if only just a couple more minutes) I wouldve been able to make it much more smoother with many fewer (and I mean many fewer requests).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    basically built by sending request and receiving responses (JSON of course) and with a loop keep on simulating what could be happening
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time and no Front-end.  I am able to design a pretty good backend, unfortunately with no front end spent most of my time attempting to build a map and update according to the results.  Results as you see are no good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was actually able to get it running the requests(until capital one server kicks me out :p) was able to let it run for a couple of minutes if not hours (went to sleep :p)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot, how having access to the backend is key to making a design with many fewer request and responses needed to be sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CapitalOneSimulator - No GUI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next will be importing the data to my own database and continue building off from there by making jobs, a merchant with an actual account with money and attempt to run the U.S economy as close as possible.  Cant forget that I still have to worry about the frontend of the projects...........
