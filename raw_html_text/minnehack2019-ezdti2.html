                    Hemptation is a service aimed towards farmers to help connect buyers and sellers to create an easy and transparent marketplace specifically for hemp. It also allows farmers to share growing strategies between each other using

                    We have chosen to promote the growth of hemp for a variety of reasons: the plant has 25,000 different uses, hemp is an eco-friendly alternative to many crops, hemp has miraculous potential for sequestering carbon, reducing agricultural pollution, and allowing farmers to make large profits on marginal land. It is naturally resistant to most pests, grows in tight conditions reducing land needed, and can grow in a variety of climates. A recent Cornell University analysis found that profits ranged from roughly $130 to $730 per acre &ndash; comparable to most grain crops on the lower end and approaching high-value vegetable crops on the upper end.

                    Growing hemp is rapidly expanding: in 2016 there was 10,000 acres grown in the U.S. whereas in 2017 there was 26,000 acres grown. However, just a couple months ago, the Farmers Bill, which legalized growing hemp, was passed. Experts predict this will create an economic boom in the hemp industry.

                    Since hemp is rapidly expanding, there is little information on the best strategies and practices for growing hemp. Hemptation's goal aims towards informing farmers of the best growing methods. This will increase production yields and further the science behind growing.
