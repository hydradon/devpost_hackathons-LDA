                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drawing on Kevin MacLeod&rsquo;s Loneliness and Davey Wreden&rsquo;s The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide, Empathy focuses on a simple narrative aimed to invoke a specific human emotion: empathy for child refugees. 1 in 200 children worldwide is refugees, fleeing from war, violence, discrimination, persecution, and limited opportunities. As privileged citizens, we often turn a blind eye to these issues. The goal of Empathy is to fuel passionate activism to combat xenophobia, discrimination, and marginalization in countries of transit and destination.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empathy is a serious game that guides the user through a narrative story of a child refugee.
                    <br>
                    Since this game is still in development, gameplay is not fool-proof and follows very defined rules, such as 
(1.) You must click the mouse or press enter only once when a text box is displayed
(2.) In some rooms, you must talk to someone to continue (i.e. mother and shopkeeper). They will only talk to you if you gently boop them.
(3.) You must download the data file to the same destination as the .exe

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empathy was built in Unity, with scripts written in C# and edited in Microsoft's Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was our major challenge.  Scripting could only begin in earnest after scene design was completed, and scene design alone took hours. It was also a challenge to balance a simple narrative with an engaging story.
