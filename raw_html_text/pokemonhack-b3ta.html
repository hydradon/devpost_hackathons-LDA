                    Inspiration I wanted to make something kind of lighthearted and fun for the hackathon, but didn't really know what to make. Since I've played a lot of video games from rpgs to mobas and everything in between, I decided I would make a game. I didn't want it to be one of those linear games, however, so a lot of the things that you have to do are revolving around secrets and (hopefully soon) sidequests.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : It's a fully functional hack of pokemon ruby, although it is somewhat short for now (due to time), it has a new storyline and motive, breaks the fourth wall often, and is an enjoyable game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it : I used a program called advance map to make editing the map and accessing the scripts easier, so that I didn't have to memorize the offsets to edit text.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into : Learning how to write the scripts was the hardest part because a lot of the maps reused memory offsets, so unless you completely rewrite scripts they would all edit each other.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of : Of course there are all of my witty puns scattered throughout the game, I'm proud of the originality put into the game. It definitely isn't the standard pokemon game, which is something I prefer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned : I learned how to write scripts effectively so that I could get characters to move where I want them to, say what I want them to say, and overall create a functional game that is something I would enjoy playing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PokemonHack(b3ta) : Probably making a full story, creating side quests that involve major towns in the game being cut off unless you complete them (they can be done in any order, gives freedom to the player)
