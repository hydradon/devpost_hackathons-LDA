                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reflecting upon our lack of physical activity since arriving at university, we wanted to create a platform that would encourage others to take the steps to becoming active, or "swoll."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive website that allows the user to observe the physical changes when one engages in exercise or "getting jacked."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Visual Studio Code to code all of the website and published it online using GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with little to no experience in CSS, javascript, and html but after EXTENSIVE research and trial and error, we were able to accomplish our goal of expanding our coding knowledge as well as creating a product we are proud to submit for this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the button modify the height and width variable of the image continuously was very difficult but extremely rewarding once we were finally able to code it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what is required in basic web development and progressed in our coding capabilities.
