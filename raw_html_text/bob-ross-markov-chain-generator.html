                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no other artist more focused on process/growth over end-result than Bob Ross!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trains a Markov Chain using transcripts from Bob Ross's show, and then outputs text in his affect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python for this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to teach ourselves the fundamentals of Markov Chains, and we had to do some digging to find Bob Ross transcripts!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    His voice really shines through in the generated text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Markov chains, more python syntax esp about dictionaries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bob Ross Markov Chain Generator!
