                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humans for millennia have lived in small communities, tribes and villages of less than a few hundred people. Only relatively recently in human history have we become technologically advanced and started living in bigger communities. But living closer together has not improved communities. We have paradoxically become more isolated as our living arrangements have become more compact. Everyone faces problems in their lives that could others nearby could easily help with but it is more often than not impractical and too awkward to ask for help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many times have you desperately needed a stapler? Or ran out of milk? Or needed help getting luggage up flights of stairs? There needs to be a way for people to harness the power of their immediate community to help solve these small problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People need to feel needed! Apparently, the elderly are 3x more likely to die if they don&rsquo;t feel needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    favorMe allows people to give and ask for small favors. Users can download the app and create an account from which point onwards they can access the favor marketplace. The radius of the favor marketplace in miles/km can be adjusted in the settings screen. They can make a request by typing it in a search function. After making a request a feed is updated and everyone with the app in the favor marketplace radius is notified of the new request. Other users can then choose to accept the request, if they do so they are then given a time limit to fulfil the favor. If the time limit runs out, the favor request is returned to the feed for another user to fulfil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Rewards system: Users are given favorPoints when they first sign up. Afterwards, users must do favors for others in return for more favorPoints which they can redeem for favors themselves.)
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built favorMe app using MIT App Inventor 2, a language that uses a graphical interface that lets users drag-and-drop visual objects to build an application for Android.

                            While Patrick Blinkhorn had experience with App Inventor in the past, he needed to review the language for several hours before he was comfortable using it again. In addition, he helped address several challenges his teammates encountered with App Inventor.

                            None of us have android phones, so we needed to use the Android Emulator to test our app. It takes approximately 2-3 minutes to load the Android Emulator, so we spent a significant amount of time waiting for to test our app on the Emulator.

                        <p>
                            On Saturday night, we encountered a major scaling issue with the layout of the app on the Android Emulator. It took us several hours to a) deduce the source of the bug, and b) to restructure and reformat the parameters so that all of the components fit on the screen.

                            Worked in a group setting to brainstorm a potentially revolutionary app that could connect individuals to exchange favors and regain the human connection that we are losing--ironically--as we live in more compact spaces.

                            That there are platforms made to make coding easy. The idea behind App Inventor is to help people who do not know programming make an app! Coding is likely to become more and more friendly to the common person.
