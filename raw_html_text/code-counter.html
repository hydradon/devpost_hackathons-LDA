                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the incremental game Cookie Clicker, and thought that a similar game on alexa would be a perfect fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start with 0 lines of code.  Initially you have to manually write code by saying "Alexa, write a line of code".   Asking "alexa list upgrades" presents you with a list of upgrades that you can buy to start generating code for you.  Once you buy these upgrades, you will generate code all day every day, even if you are not interacting with the alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and the python ask_sdk library that allows us to easily interact with AWS.  For storing our data we used Amazons Dynamo DB.  The actual code is stored in an AWS Lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial setup took much longer than expected as this was our first time working with an Alexa app and we had to learn how all the parts work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game actually works!  And we have a few fun hidden easter eggs inside as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton about how to interact with the AWS console, DynamoDB, and Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code Counter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully an eventual push to the skills store so other people can play our game.
