                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this app in order to gain knowledge in Swift and iOS app development. My goal is to obtain a summer internship in an Apple based company that will allow me to further my iOS app development skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is a task list app that allows the user to enter task, descriptions and dates. Then the tasks are ordered by date. If the tasks are completed the user can swipe across them and add them to the completed list. If the user no longer wants this task on their completed list, they can swipe across and delete it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this application using Swift on Xcode for iOS and Github with terminal commands. While building this app, I created four view controllers that control what the user sees and how the user can interact with the app. The first view controller displays the screen the user sees upon first opening the app, which is the To Do and Completed Lists. The second view controller is the view that allows a user to Edit an already existing task, which appears when clicking on a task. The third view controller allows the user to Add a New Task to the list, which is done by clicking the plus sign. The final view controller is a basic description of the project and then the version number, which is displayed by clicking Details.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into included but are not limited to:
(1) I am new to Swift and iOS programming so I watched a lot of tutorials and read up on the topic. 
(2) I ran into trouble trying to incorporate Core Data into my program, which in turn caused over an hour of back tracking with version control to recover my app back to its last operable version. 
(3) Version control most likely took that long to recover because I am also new to that concept too. I had little prior experience with Git and learned to better use it with Xcode while hacking.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would be the accomplishment I am proud of as it is  my first successful, useful iOS that I have created and was able to run. I am also proud to get so much accomplished at my first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What I learned with this experience is that a lot can be accomplished in a short amount of time if you put your head to it and have strong drive and determination. If I wanted to, I could have stopped after my team split-up Saturday morning, but I kept moving, determined to create something, even if by myself, by Sunday. I also learned how to post and edit a video for Youtube, which was a first for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TaskIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing I want to do for TaskIT is incorporate a settings tab and an alarm. The settings I would like to include login information that allows the user to sync data from one device to another. The next thing I would like to see happen with this app is to add an alarm or reminder to priority tasks in the list that are displayed in a different color at the top of the list to show importance. Due to my coding skills and familiarity with iOS Swift coding, I currently do not have the skills to do this but will continue to develop my skills to obtain these results with this app and future apps. Also, I would like to develop this app for more than just one device.
                    <strong>
                        This app is currently designed only for an iPhone 5S.
