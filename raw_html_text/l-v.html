                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to harness the power of Clarifai's image recognition to take more control over what we see on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a chrome extension where the user can choose celebrities they do not want to see while browsing the internet and a category of gifs to replace their photos with. For example, I could tell the plugin that I do not want to see images of Donald Trump and instead I want to see gifs of kittens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to get information from web pages, make requests to Clarifai and Giphy, and replace certain images with gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges figuring out how to create a chrome extension and how to formulate our request to Clarifai

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    This is my first hackathon and I am proud to have learned so much and accomplished creating this chrome extension

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned more about how to use Chrome developer tools and JavaScript to interact with webpages

                <p>
                    We want to make this plugin more customizable
