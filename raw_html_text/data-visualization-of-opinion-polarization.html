                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this program we aim to simulate different models of opinion formation within an interacting population.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We consider each individual, or agent, in the population to have some opinion between 0 and 1 which they update based on the opinions of all other agents in the population. To normalize this updating each agent has a weight associated with all other agents such that agent i's

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used python to visualize the data, using different libraries to graph multiple complex plots in a simple and visually appealing manner.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding complex mathematical models and knowing how to display them in a visually appealing manner. Implementing the limitations and being aware of its parameters and how it affects the data.

                <p>
                    Implementing an improved user interface in order to make it more user-friendly. Use other models so that we can easily generate simulations that are easy to compare with each other.
