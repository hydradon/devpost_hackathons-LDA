                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been following Russian bots on twitter for a while. We were wondering how difficult it might be to create our own network of bots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a bot net. It's a group of users that are constantly tweeting 24/7 and can go and follow or tweet at an account of our choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went on sketchy Russian forums and bot a handful of accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't. Twitter security is very lax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a few accounts that will now probably be considered active users according to Twitter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter has a big bot problem and their not doing enough to stop it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bot Net
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to see what happens with a larger botnet.
                </p>
