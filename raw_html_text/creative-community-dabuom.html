                    Bringing Us Together Through Music!

                    The tree that fell in the forest was never heard. Sound is engrained within each one of us and resonates among us. We are all artists in a sense and a great way to convey our message is through sound. It's one of the many ways we communicate amongst each other and express ourselves! Even if it's through our voice or an instrument. Music brings the community as a whole together and allows us to synchronize and harmonize within ourselves as well as with others around us. It is the beginning of creativity and can be as pure as the essence that creates it. This site allows Artists all around the world to come together to share and view their and others creations! Let life be the beat and the way you live it be the rythm. Share your creations with others and let the tree be heard!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We have set up an Arduino that has infrared sensors and through motion we want to create music! Along with this we created an website using raspberry pi server and build a framework for a brighter community!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We ran into lots of challenges, from refreshing our memories with all the different scripts and trouble with hardware components as well as currents running through. We also faced many challenges with raspberry pi and connecting remotely through ssh due to the unstable campus wifi.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of are that we all worked together and learned a lot of things as well as make new connections!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    we want to evolve this into something more generative art and start building this to become better and add new features to it!
