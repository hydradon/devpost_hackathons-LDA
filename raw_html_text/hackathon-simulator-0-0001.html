                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try out something with Unity, so what better than
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically a game based on the typical hackathon experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity was used for most of it, but we also used Android and Node.js to provide functionality to let a smartphone be used as a controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is...well....Unity. Merging work would cause really strange bugs and in some cases just make Unity freeze completely. The submitted repository provides multiple branches to show the different pieces of functionality we were able to implement properly.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic game development with Unity

                    What's next for Hackathon Simulator 0.0001
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're likely going to want to revisit this project, perhaps at a future hackathon. But if this happens, in the spirit of not just continuing on an old project with preexisting code, the only thing that it would truly share in common with the original would be the general idea. Implementation would be built from scratch. We were hoping to get to use Oculus in our app, but couldn't get to it due to time constraints. We hope to reexplore the possibility of using Oculus in a future hackathon.
