                    RemindMe is a GroupMe bot that, once told a list of upcoming events, can remind everyone in a group chat about upcoming events. A server is also included that allows clients to update the csv file through the network. The default setting sends reminders for events in the following hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Requires Python3 and GroupyAPI
                </p>
                <p>
                    Server only tested on Linux. Client also tested on Windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The optimal way of using RemindMe is a 24/7 linux box running the server (like a raspberry pi) with a Windows laptop being able to update the events list.

                            Make sure GroupyAPI is installed and .groupy.key file is made and in the correct place.

                            Put the scripts somewhere safe. For this tutorial, we will be putting it in ~/events
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Create a new 'events.csv' file in the same directory as the script.
The 'events.csv' is formated like so:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="language-nolang"><code>"DD/MM","HH:MM","Description"
e.g
"02/14","21:23","9:23pm Event"
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The first line (columns) is:
                        </p>
                        <pre class="language-nolang"><code>"Date","Time","Description"
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            (make sure to make a new line after)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Create a cron job to run the script every full hour.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="language-bash"><code>crontab -e
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/username/events/remindme.py
</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Run server.py
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The server only needs server.py up 24/7 if you want to be able to update the events csv from another computer. You can edit the csv from the server manually also.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to manually send a reminder, just run remindme.py.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        On another computer, put the client.py script in a folder. For this tutorial it's in
                        <code>
                            C:\Users\Username\Events
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The client script requires a events.csv file in the same directory. So copy the events.csv you made from before. Changes made to this csv file will be sent to the server when client.py is run (and server.py is listening).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Edit client.py so that the IP address matches that of the server's.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="language-python"><code>host = "localhost" #most likely not localhost
port = 12345

                        <p>
                            Now just add your events to the events.csv and run client.py to send it to the Server.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    EventFileWriter.exe is a simple Visual Basic program that provides a GUI for editing the events.csv file.
Make sure events.csv exists and is formatted properly before launching.
