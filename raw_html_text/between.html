                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first motivation that inspired us is to fulfill people's basic instincts; men like women, and women like men. Another goal was to make unique (like) chat website which people rarely discussed before. Lastly one of our members wanted to know from the majority how they would perceive himself and his girlfriend together.

                <p>
                    Users may upload photos with their partner to receive comments from other users, and to see what they would think of any couples they have seen on the web. In addition, users can write a brief note about concerns related to their partner, to get advice from others to build a better relationship with partner or spouse.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main language we've used was "Ruby on Rails", and also used HTML and CSS as secondary sources to develop our website. It was all about teamwork that led us to accomplish to finish our project on time.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most devasting challenge we've faced was of course, the technical difficulties. However, it taught us to be more conscious while working on a group project, which under the time limit.

                    As mentioned, it was a teamwork that tremendously grabbed us to focus on finishing our planned goals. We are all proud to each other. Every individual sincerely thought of their responsibility on our own roles, and assisted to each other if any of us struggled. All of us feel very lucky and honor to work in this group.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We have learned that there are so many passionate programmers who have ideas and desire to realize them with their own skills. It was full of frustration for all of us to be honest, but LA Hacks taught us the lesson how important the teamwork is, under the leadership from our group leader.
