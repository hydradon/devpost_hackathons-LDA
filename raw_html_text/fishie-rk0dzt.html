                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We were originally inspired in part to help the environment and one of the best ways to do so is by gathering accurate real-time data about various different species and how they react to the current global climate.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Currently, It will allow users to take photos and cross reference them with a database of different species of fish and and, in the future, diversify to different marine species. The app also record prevalence of a species in the location of the fisher. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We utilized Java and the google cloud platform to initiate a machine learning algorithm which predicts the species presented by a user image. Android Studio was used to built the bulk of the application. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Installing the sdk for both android studio and GCP was a main cause of concern as well as the issue with the auto-ml api in trying to train it to detect between predetermined species of fish.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We were able to put together the app and connect android studio with the GCP.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Although many fishing apps exist, ours is much needed because the internet barely has data on rare species of fish that need dire attention for being studied on. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fishie
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The next attempt is to connect Fishie with researchers and scientists to further the goal of real-time status of various fish in different biomes in the world.
