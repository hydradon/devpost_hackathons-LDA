                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to get new stories from Rick and Morty + learn a bunch of stuff about Recurrent Neural Networks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program trains on whatever text you give it and then generates text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not. I copied it from here:
                    <a href="https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare
                    </a>
                    I just experimented with different training parameters, e.g.: Number of epochs, the percentage of dropoff, layers, sequence length.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking too long to train :D Also it turns out 3 seasons it's not enough data. Choosing the right training parameters was also challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few things about RNNs, and also I tried to use Flask to make this into a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rick and Morty SEASON 4
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just want to read more about RNNs and find out how I can improve their efficiency and results.
