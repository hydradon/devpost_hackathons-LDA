                    Our Idea
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Currently, in American society, it is often a long process to donate to a charity, and is often overlooked. People who want to donate money are often stuck with what charity they want to donate to, what charity to trust, where to donate online, etc.We wanted to create a process to streamline how people can donate to reputable charitable organizations. This led to Your Charity Choice, a nonprofit organization that connects the average user to charities across the United States. By providing an easier service to choose a charity and connect to their donation page, we believe that we can create a higher level of social good by increasing the amount of donations that a organization receives.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How We Built It
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Currently, our code is a frontend-based app, using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. We attempted to create a backend API server using Spring MVC, Java, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, etc. Our graphic designer in the team used Adobe Illustrator to create the logo.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How It Works
                </h1>
                <p>
                    First, the user is greeted with a front page introducing our organization and how we wish to help social good by providing this service. At the toolbar at the top, we gave the option to choose preselected donation sites or a random donation site (if the person who wishes to donate does not know what organization to donate to). In the preselected donation sites page (named &ldquo;Donate&rdquo;), people can choose from a list of the top 5 charities rated by Forbes Magazine, or choose from several popular causes, and reputable charities that help with these causes.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What&rsquo;s Next?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to implement a way to give charity reviews and a system to rank charities based on what charities believe in. Currently, we have the Forbes Top 100 US Charities implemented to provide the current top 5 charitable organizations. We want to be able to provide an option where we can provide that top 5 rated charities that uses out charity ranking system.
