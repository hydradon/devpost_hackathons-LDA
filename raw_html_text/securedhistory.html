                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To increase awareness about secured browsing.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Checks your chrome browser history and return a graph of how many secured and unsecured sites you visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a chrome extension to get a list of websites visited and mark them as secured or unsecured connection based on http or https request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to monitor the network encryption type for a better analysis, but integrating chrome extension, beaker and extracting client side SSID turned out to be extremely challenging. Unfortunately, this made the entire project be seperated into parts not integrated with each other but working independently.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create and run Chrome extensions!
                </p>

                    What's next for SecuredHistory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps integrate the modules and figure out a way to analyze it better. It will eventually act as a personal analysis tool to check how much a user needs a proxy or VPN client for future browsing.
