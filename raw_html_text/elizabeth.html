                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of enhancing and customizing fashion with technology.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elizabeth is a dress that adjusts length based on temperature and user preference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elizabeth created the dress by using cloth, zippers, and sewing materials. Reshef and Elizabeth used the hemp cord to enable the adjustment of the dress. Shef laser cut shoulder supports. Ben and Reshef worked on the Arduino Uno platform to enable the step motors adjust the dress. Rob worked on integrating the temperature sensor. Madhur design the product identity and the webpage.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A series of failed ideas contributed to finding the hemp cords to make the dress adjustable. A series of failed ideas contributed to make the motors work with the Arduino.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of teaming up with a fashion student who was able to prototype and design a dress in less than 24 hours.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that by utilizing everyone's strengths, a lot can be accomplished as a team.

                    What's next for Elizabeth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to add a mobile app from which you can control the dress seems like a great next step!
