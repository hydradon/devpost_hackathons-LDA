                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Amadeus's challenge to make it a "Small World" by encouraging community within the travel industry.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows users to create travel itineraries for their upcoming plans.  In addition to being useful for planning, the itinerary can also be shared with other users who can comment on it.  This should encourage many travelers to help one another have the best trips they can.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and CSS for the front end.  The back end was split between PHP and Flask working on SQL data.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of strange errors and problems we encountered throughout this project. Some included a peculiar error saying there was an error importing psycog2 when this was not use at all, an error were python demanded we encrypt our data, and an especially irritating error where our port number was wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking into this project, we literally had no knowledge about SQL, Flask, PHP, HTML, or CSS. We spent the whole first day watching Lynda tutorials to figure out what to do. So, I would say the accomplishment we are most proud of is actually finishing the project and having something worth presenting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton working on this project.  Neither of us have had any significant experience with managing databases or creating front ends coming into this project.  We were very lucky to have a variety of people who helped us work through the many errors we ran into on the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MetaScape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue working on this project, there is a lot we can improve.  Obviously, we would add the ability to have many users on the system.  We would also add some sort of posting limit or spam filters to block bad input for the itineraries or comments.
