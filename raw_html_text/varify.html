                    Team fit becomes an increasingly important factor for recruiting decision-making.
Recruiting processes, however, are often biased by subjective decisions either by the recruiter or the final decision of the manager. . 
AI-based video recognition combined with predefined questions tries to overcome this subjective process by comparing the performance to well-perfoming past employees. 
Similarly, some companies still rely on psychologically validated personality tests.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We interviewed the recruiters here at the hackathon and learned that they don't believe in an algorithm to assess something that is such an essential human skill - the evaluation of whether two persons can work together well. 
It seems the human recruiters don't actually want AI interfering with their hiring process. They rather argue to trust their gut feeling while being well aware of negative biases they could run into.
