                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a common saying on the internet that it's nearly impossible to determine sarcasm using just text. To remedy this, most people write '/s' to denote sarcasm. We decided to test just how difficult it is to determine if someone is 
sarcastic or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our reddit bot scrapes all incoming comments and sorts them into two files: sarcasm.txt and no_sarcasm.txt based on whether or not the comment contains '\s'. After doing a bit of machine learning, it will, given a string input, try to determine whether or not the person is being sarcastic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the reddit api and python to scrape comments as they came in and sort them. Then, all the comments were slightly sanitized and all the words put into a context-based tsne graph using a neural network. This allows similar points to represent similar words; ideas are clustered together. We then used random forests to represent the paths taken; this works on the assumption that sarcastic sentences take different paths than non-sarcastic sentences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a good data set and training in such a short amount of time is extremely difficult. After running the bot overnight, we only got ~1000 sarcastic comments-- nowhere near enough to fully train out bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though the bot doesn't work too well, all of the framework is there. Given more time, we would be able to get better results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about python, tensorflow, and using google cloud. Even though the bot doesn't work as well as we want, we're still excited about how much we've learned in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SarcasticBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we'd keep expanding our data set and throwing more compute power (and possibly more/better regression methods) to get a better result. We're also working on a naive version to compare the ML to that.
