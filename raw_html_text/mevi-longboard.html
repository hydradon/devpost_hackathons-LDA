                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students living on a large campus we needed a method of fast and cool transportation. Longboards are cool, but not cool enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a modular kit that attaches to any flat longboard via 4 screws. This kit has an electric motor, a pair of headlights, and brake lights. We custom built a handheld remote controller as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We 3D printed parts to mount the motor to the truck, and attach to the wheel. We laser cut pieces of wood to house the batteries and other electronic components needed to power the motors and communicate with the remote control. 
We 3D printed a remote control casing to fit around the electronic components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D prints failed, laser cutter was not calibrated correctly which resulted in use wasting some material and had to redesign our box.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishing this project within the time frame.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expect the unexpected.

                    What's next for MEVI Longboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on refining this prototype and try to market it to college students as a ready-to-attach kit to longboards, and start selling them online.
