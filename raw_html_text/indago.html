                    A autonomous drone with a rescure protocol.

                    The drones job
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a disaster hits like a tsunami, earthquake, or hurricane a dangerous environment can be left behind but a rescue with a sense of duty strives to save as many lives as they can. But a dangerous environment, such as floods left behind a hurricane or unstable buildings after earthquakes, will slow down a rescue team. The drone will fly and search for humans with its camera and sends back the GPS location to the rescue team. With collsion detection the drone can also make a quick map of the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inside the drone and the code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone is controlled by wifi by android phone. While the drone is flying video is sent to be analyze using OpenCV to see if any humans are in the images. If there are people the drone will also sent back its GPS location.
