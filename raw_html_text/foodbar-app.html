                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ordering at restaurants is a manual process. Wait staff goes to patrons to collect order information, either via hand or by app. The waiter still has to be in person in order for the order to be processed. Order updates and changes still have to occur with the assistance of wait staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Bar is a service that enables restaurants to manage dining orders. Through Food Bar, patrons can use the app to place orders without interacting with staff. Restaurant staff can view incoming orders in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Order submission and order management is free, but marketing and analytics tools will be available at a cost.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the user facing client, we are going with a mobile app. We will have a web app for restaurant staff to process order information as well as use premium features. We used Flask and Postgres for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spent time discussing how to make the patron "sign-up" process as frictionless as possible whilst obtaining useful marketing data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the patron signs up, we will collect phone numbers and/or e-mail addresses for communications/notifications. Phone numbers can be used to provide order status update texts to patrons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We considered the possibility of using SMS, QR codes, or NFC for vendor and table identification. We could either scan a QR code/NFC sticker to identify the vendor and optionally the table number or text a unique identifier for the table to a specific number. We found that NFC is widely used in Europe, but not necessarily as much in the United States. We elected to use NFC for the purposes of the demo for the added benefit of speed and usability. In the future we could make the other options possible and allow the vendor to decide.
