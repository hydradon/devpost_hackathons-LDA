                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mobile platform that shows high quality images of food around the user via Yelp's API.  The user can also choose to go into AR mode and see, through their camera, all the restaurants around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built on React-Native, along with Expo's AR kit, Microsoft Azure's image classification API, and Yelp's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AR kit was difficult to navigate, but we managed to work through it and develop a little from it.  There were also issues with setting up our postgresql database, and the initial desire to use Instagram's API was not successful.
