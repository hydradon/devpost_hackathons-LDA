                    I mostly helped people think through the user experience of their apps, because the teams I talked to all had good ideas and code but were having trouble transferring that into a usable app. I also made some other various visuals, like a poster, a motion graphic, and an app. This was a great first time experience and I made a lot of things; check them out!
