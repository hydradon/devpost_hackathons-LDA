                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our years of high school, we wished we had a platform to talk and learn from college students about their college experiences or receive advice upon entering. We wanted to connect high school students who do not have the resources or programs in their schools to college students who can give them extra support and guidance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This mobile app matches high school, college, and graduate students in campuses nation-wide, allowing them to get advice from their respective upperclassmen regarding college-specific experiences. Furthermore, the app allows students to create an account that features an instant messaging platform for students to exchange ideas and advice with their mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using InVision for prototyping, and Android Studio for development. We learned to use SQLite and Firebase for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up Android Studio on everyone's workstations, connecting Firebase to Android Studio.
Sometimes the same build would run differently on our phones too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to make buttons link to new pages in Android Studio, and we added constraints to all text boxes so they would stay in place when we ran the app on our phones. This way on-click functions would run successfully!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend is difficult to integrate into the app.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mentr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase for authentication, analytics, instant messaging between mentors and mentees, and cloud storage.
