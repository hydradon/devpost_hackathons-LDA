                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having recently started group projects at university, we noticed task allocation and team management were not easy tasks. We wanted to build a platform that would schedule the tasks and set deadlines for the team and allocate roles automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating a project and setting a few tasks, Uptimal creates a schedule to make sure the project is completed as efficiently as possible. The project manager is still allowed to modify the schedule if needed. The users (admins/project managers/employees) interact with the platform through our iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After creating a project and setting a few tasks, our backend, powered by Google Cloud Engine, analyses the data, and using the concept of Critical Path Analysis, creates a directed graph of the project tasks. This allows us to identify the dependencies between the tasks and makes sure the critical tasks are completed at a certain point in time. The iOS app was written in Swift, and the backend in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lot of special cases when performing the CPA. Furthermore, there are a lot of optimisation approaches, but did not have time to implement all of our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took time to design the code carefully and think about the graph algorithms in detail. This isn't particularly the point of a hackathon, but we are still happy that we took time to make sure the platform ran as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also happy that we managed to keep the user interface simple, as there are a lot of project management apps that are often overly-complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We taught ourselves how to use Google Cloud Services and the MailJet API. We self-discovered advanced concepts in graph theory.
