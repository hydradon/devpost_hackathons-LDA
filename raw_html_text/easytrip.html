                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to improve upon cloudflare by providing a less costly alternative to provide DDOS protection.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To do this we had to change our thinking on how data would be handled. Instead of paying for expensive servers we use the power of a botnet against itself. We use the Web RTC standard to enable browser to browser data transfer such that incoming requests to the server are logged and then then the requested packets are returned by a combined network of peers to distribute the load of any request to an easily manageable amount.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used:
Web RTC standard to communicate with browser.
Firebase to discover browsers on the network.
                </p>
