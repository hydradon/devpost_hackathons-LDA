                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a new apartment living resident, we quickly realized that while doing groceries we didn't know what was a good price for everything we wanted to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app let's you crowd source grocery prices, search a particular item and get the average and lowest price for that item near you. With our shopping list, we can see where would be the cheapest place to go to get everything you need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Python Flask backend, we connected to Parse Cloud to manage our backend data services. On the front-end, we used bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. Our app is powered by a Azure infrastructure and uses Microsoft's Oxford Image Recognition to allow users to upload their grocery receipts and get a filter list of each item they purchased to assist in the item adding process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While our front-end app is not finished yet, the backend has been fully developed allowing user registration, adding items, searching for items, building a grocery list, and getting the cheapest items based on your current location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smarter OCR response filtering (to get just the items from a receipt), User authentication and profiles in Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for mom - the cheap groceries finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish the front end and connect it to our backend to make the page dynamic.
