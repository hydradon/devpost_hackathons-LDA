                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The price of knowledge is giving knowledge. Omnia is a living (or as close to living as an app can be) embodiment of that philosophy. Taking a page from Wikipedia's book, users create the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever had a question about literally anything? Why take the 5 seconds to Google it when you can take 4 asking Omnia? The only catch is - you won't get your answer until YOU answer a question. Spread the knowledge and gain some knowledge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our small but brilliant team of four individuals had two working on an iOS application while the other two built seperate clients for Omnia; a website and a Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What happens when an unstoppable force meets a stoppable object? You can ask the trolls of the internet that question, because as soon as they meet Omnia, 2 + 2 isn't four anymore. How do we deal with these people? How do we deal with multiple answers?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Omnia is complete! Or as complete as a hackthon's worth of coding will get!
