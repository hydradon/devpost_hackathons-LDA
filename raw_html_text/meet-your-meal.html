                    When we search for our food we begin with the thing that really matters.
Your Meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that in today&rsquo;s world, your meal experience should be further tailored to satisfy your tastes
                </p>
                <p>
                    We begin with your meal.
What kind of food are you feeling today?
Are you searching on a budget or have a dietary restriction?
We used Beautifulsoup to extract specific meals offered at local restaurants
We then find your meal match using a machine learning solution

                    We scraped Yelp to get meal information to add to our database. 
We calculated the price ranges, dietary restrictions, and ratings of the meals.
Using a process called Collaborative Filtering, we were able to give the user the best 5 meals based on another, similar, person&rsquo;s interests and what meals they chose.
