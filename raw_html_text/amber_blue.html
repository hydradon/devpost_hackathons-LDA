                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People keep forgetting their belongings from time to time because of which they have to miss out on some exam, or meetings, or specific appointments. 
For example, if you forget some important document during your passport appointment, you will have to miss the appointment and seek for an another day if you have no time to collect it and come back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a platform where you can call for an SOS from your location and ask for someone to get your document and deliver it who is already destined to move in that direction an is ready to help someone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used algorithms to route map the Seekers(one who has requested) location and that of the Samaritan(one who is getting the belonging) in such a way that the samaritan doesn't have to take a  detour. In return to this urgent service being provided the Seeker pays a certain amount to the Samaritan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 - Trust factor between the Samaritan and that of Seeker was in doubts - 
-To solve this we gave a rating and review which helps a Seeker to trust the Samaritan.
-Moreover The Samaritan earns a social Ranking for each SOS delivery he/she does. As it is a help in disguise.
-Other authentication factors include FB login.
2 - Why would anyone agree to deliver- 
-The whole aim is to create a culture of helping by giving Social Ranking as the login is through Facebook.
-Moreover The person is getting an incentive for each delivery, based on the priority of delivery. The incentive helps the person recover the fuel costs which the person would anyways incur anyways.
-Indirectly, its helping other causes like traffic issues .
