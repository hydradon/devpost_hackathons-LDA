                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Sara went to Paris and Yasmeen went to China, they were both very confused and often didn't get to enjoy the experience of travelling because of the language barrier. Because of this, Yasmeen ended up eating just rice and pineapple cakes for two weeks and Sara found out what escargo was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LINGO VR is an immersive experience in virtual reality&ndash;the user is immediately dropped in a city in which the language they want to learn is spoken. They then have to interact with the environment and the people around them in the scene, and the way it plays out is based on user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the 3D scenes and wrote our scripts in C#. We also created and animated the objects in our application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Vive requires a large setup area and we realized when we got here that we didn't have the basestations, so Akshaya's dad had to drive 4 hours roundtrip to bring them to us just for this hack. We had to stack up multiple chairs (if you noticed on the 2nd floor) and empty chips boxes to act as tripods.

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We utilized a bunch of APIs to take foreign speech to text, pull the keywords, and generate a response which is outputted in that same foreign language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Extracted audio even though we had to do a bunch of file conversions to even get to the speech to text part

                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to create a greater variety of scenes in different countries and possibly make the experience a more social one.
