                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday, Tristrum and I witnessed people in our lives being hurt by those that they hold most dearly. We set out to create a program to repair and nurture their relationships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Counsel Through Code asks relationship partners various questions and listens to their responses. Using these responses Counsel Through Code can identify relationship weak and strong points, each partner's needs in the relationship and tries to keep the conversation going by focusing questions on topic's the partners have mentioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we record the audio using built-in Java classes. Next we send this audio to the Houndify API and get back a text transcription. We send this text to IBM-Watson which gives back relationship data analysis on both responses and the conversation as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matching the bit rate of our recorded audio to that of the Houndify API was a struggle. Also, parsing JSON into Java was a huge pain. It was so hard to keep track of JSON Arrays that we had to paste the output into google docs and highlight through it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are freshmen computer science students at Penn. This is one of our first hackathons, so we are mostly proud of ourselves for making it through this 48 hour coding marathon. Getting the multiple APIs working, as well as the graphics and user interface, was definitely an added bonus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about Houndify API and programming in general. Before this hackathon, I barely knew how to install a JAR file. We both gained experience with graphics, .wav files, and integrating multiple classes in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Counsel Through Code / Marriage Counselor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product that we are submitting at this point in time is far from finished. We have the basic framework complete, but we definitely need to polish up the response library and AI. Additionally, IBM Watson has a ton of extra methods for analyzing text that can really improve the level of counseling provided by Counsel Through Code. We look forward to patching up our code and improving our project in the future!
