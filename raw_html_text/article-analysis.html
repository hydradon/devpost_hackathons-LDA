                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the blowup of fake news during the last election, many people have been argued the morality of such news outlets. Our team wanted to find a way to reduce this endless flow of fraudulent news so we built this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website gives users data that we, as a team, thought were great metrics to judge an article's validity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site has four metrics used to judge a article's validity. We used IBM's Watson cloud alchemy module and WhoIs protocol to help us extract data from an article.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble deploying the web server. We also had trouble designing the layout of the website. We also hit IBM's API call limit within a day while testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site is visually appealing, and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to visualize data programatically. We also became more adept about site building and deployment in general. We learned how to work under strict time constraints as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fake News App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more metrics, since in the short amount of time we had we couldn't implement all of the metrics a user could use to effectively gauge a articles validity.
