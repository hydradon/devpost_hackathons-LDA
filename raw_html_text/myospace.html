                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was to create a simple game that allows the user to cast a spell based on their concentration level. We were to measure the concentration level of the player using the Muse Brain Sensing device. Unfortunately we could not realize this project because the Muse SDK is currently not available for our build platform(Windows OS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We subsequently had to pivot to another game idea (our current product). Our initial plan was to use the Leap Motion Controller to control the game, but we encountered another issue with this device (issues with using the SDK on our development machine). We finally had to use Myo Gesture Control Armband as the controller of our current game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a minmalistic retro space shooting game that is controlled by the Myo Gesture Controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Game Maker. The Myo controller for the game was setup by using the Keyboard mapper application built into Myoconnect application. The design for the game object was done using Adobe Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered several challenges from our intial game idea using Muse Brain Sensing device to our space shooting game. In the case of our current product, we had issues setting up the technology stack on our development system due to restrictions on the systems. This was resolved with the help of our excellent event staffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we encountered some minor challenges in using the Myo controller. The controller kept locking itself after a very brief period of inactivity (e.g. 2 seconds) when playing the game.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely, we are proud of finishing a product howbeit simple despite the challenges we encountered in what was the first hackathon for all members of the team.

                        - Try and try again to build and finish and idea despite set backs. Of course the event staffs provided wonderful support that enabled us to complete this product.

                        - we have gained knowledge of new tool (Game maker) and awesome hardware device Myo. Devices like Myo, Leap Motion etc are going to play a big part in the pervasive computing and IOT in the near future.

                    Hopefully fine-tune the Myo controller so that the controls for the game is smoother, providing better experience
