                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over my four years in high school I was a programmer for my robotics team.  In my final year, I was lead programmer for my team, and had to learn how to use Android Studio for our new FTC team.  I briefly stumbled through a few lessons, but I really enjoyed programming our robot.  I decided that today would be an awesome time to apply some of that knowledge to something outside of robotics.  Using Android Studio and my limited knowledge of sensors, I decided to create a cowbell app.  I can't wait to show this to my friends that are still in high school, so they can see that the talents they are learning have real world application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can either rapidly tap, or shake your android device to ring your digital cowbell!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using android studio, youtube, and lots of posts on Stack Overflow, I was able to put together my cowbell app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get the cowbell to play on touch very easily, but using the accelerometer  proved to be extremely difficult.  I knew that it wouldn't be a true cowbell experience without being able to shake it!  Eventually, and with the support of some friends, I was able to get it to work to some degree.  Still could use some work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very happy that I was able to apply some of my old skills to something new.  I've never made an app before, and I hardly know any java, so I'm incredibly happy to have finished it.  I was even able to publish it to the google play store.  Hopefully it will be live before my demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about java and debugging today.  Most of my knowledge of programming has been in visual languages and recently some python.  After working through the development process, I learned a lot about how java works and how its syntax is different from other languages I know.  I also learned how to use phones' sensors to improve how the user can interact with my app.  It's really awesome to see all that robotics finally have a real world application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clang-a-lang Cowbell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Clang-a-lang Cowbell coming to the google play store, I hope to update it to be more responsive and have less bugs.  It definitely has some problems when ringing, so that is my primary focus.  After that, I hope to make it more aesthetically pleasing and maybe add some animations.  Hopefully other Mississippi State students will love it!
