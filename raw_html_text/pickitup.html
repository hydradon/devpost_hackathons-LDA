                    Scalability
&bull; This product will work in parks, convention centers, shopping centers, lakes, beaches and places where sponsors will take full advantage of the program. (advertisements and they will be creating the app)

                    Creativity
&bull; This idea will innovate the way people dispense trash and see how valuable it is to preserve the environment by giving rewards depending on the value of the item disposed.
&bull; This idea started while thinking how to actually make people contribute and give a reward in exchange (like giving candy to a child for a good action) No one will lose anything since the customer already bought the item and the amount that will be rewarded was already in the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functionality
&bull; Does this solution solve the problem it's intended for?
&bull; This will solve major issues with contamination in the city by people who don&rsquo;t realize how much danger they do when deciding not to place trash in the correct place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Execution
&bull; This is a big project, intended to be implemented by the help of different sponsors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there can be machines that will sell us bottles of water and sodas, why not having machines that will buy people the plastic bottles or cans.
This machines could be half the size of a regular soda machine that will be compressing bottles and cans and return in exchange the value of the respective item introduced. 
Cans and bottles will be compressed, after having a full machine with compressed bottles, this will notify the department that will be in charge.
Even kids are going to be recollecting cans and bottles whenever they are out with their families while earning some cents.
The machine should notify people when it is full and how long will it take for it to be working again and start receiving more bottles.

                    Earn credit or rewards and Recycle with the App
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the App, many will store all the credit for recycling cans and bottles with PickItUp.
There will be an integrated map to locate all the stations for collecting and recycling, that way people with time might start going to some of those places where machines are and start collecting rewards or credit. This will create a cleaner city by their own citizens.
Machine will connect with the app to give credit or reward depending how the sponsors decide this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be people without a phone, the machine will give out less money for those without the app encouraging everyone to download the app and start earning rewards or cents.
