                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is inspired by Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon. The concept of turn-based roguelike adventure games was very appealing to us, so we decided to combine these features into our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create the basis for an adventure game through our time spent here, and we were able to incorporate 2D and 3D aspects into our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Unity's C# platform, we were able to animate and write code for the sprites that we got from the Internet, basing our game off of our own ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Trigger Collisions turned out to be a difficult challenge, and managing a turn-based system was much harder than we thought, as we had to provide animations for all of our characters' movements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sharing assets through Unity was pretty difficult, so we're proud of the achievements that all of us made and how we were able to collaborate and bring together our ideas into one game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating smaller ideas into our game instead of planning out details would have been more beneficial to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Abyssal Cavern
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further level development and a larger variety of characters, monsters, skills, and other details would make our game more interactive and appealing.
