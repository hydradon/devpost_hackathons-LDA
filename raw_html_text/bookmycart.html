                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of states and countries don't have proper or fast internet connection. Hence people from those countries are usually deprived of services like Uber, Yelp, Doordash, fandango etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are creating a layer between users and internet based companies so people who cannot download app or do not have proper access to internet can still use their service through SMS. Everybooking and transaction will happen directly from sms without any need of internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have aggressively used twilio's apis to create a smsparser layer and handle user flow. Apart from that we are maintaining user information in MongoDb so we know the trends of use and what he is booking using Nodejs. We are using wegmans apis to configure our first service which we can consumer through our portal.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a huge learning curve to understand the twilio platform and the services wihich they provide in different ways. We changed our implementation style thrice to fit the model in the twilio's functionalities.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team work, its been amazing.
Its first time for both my partners and the way we have enjoyed the hackathon is really the best take away.
It has been fun learning couple of new platforms and implement them in limited amount of time.

                    What's next for BookMyCart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are just showing the phase 1 which is just for user side, We have to improve user side by implementing Payments as well which we can do through sms as well. Apart from that we have to create a dashboards so the services who configure with us can see the bookings which they recieve from our app.
