                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We apply for internships, are thrilled that a company accepts us, and as the weeks go by before the start date, we look forward to it as each day builds. We imagine how much we'll learn, how engaging it'll be, the creative people we'll get to work with. Talking with buddies, however, the offer loses its shine - our male friend with equally little job experience was offered $4.00/hour more, and we had no idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        And so it begins.
                    </strong>
                    From the very first internship, we begin our lifetime earnings 20% lower than our male counterparts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to change this. We believe every woman and non-binary person deserves to know what their company is offering to their peers. It's not enough to know the general statistics - we want targeted, specifically useful data. We want people to know that we are of equal value;
                    <strong>
                        there are no imposters here.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website takes in anonymous data about salary and sentiments of the workplace via a Google Form, and uses Google Cloud Platform's ML Natural Language Processing to get the general sentiment of the text given to the ML API. The salaries were generated using math algorithms. To protect anonymity, we are initially posting only salary ranges as our dataset is still young enough to compromise confidentiality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase to host the site online, and Google Cloud Platform to analyze the data, sponsored by Google's credits given out at their demo. Using HTML and CSS, we built each page out and thought through design concepts to maximize the potency of the message we are communicating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to transfer the data from Google Sheets to Firebase, and initializing Firebase and the Google Platform API's were a steep learning curve. Jodi worked through various styling issues in HTML and CSS, as a beginner programmer, and benefitted greatly from Stack Overflow and general trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is Jodi's first hackathon, and we are so excited about this project! This mission hits home and hits across the board, with queer and racial minorities also feeling the hit, and we want to continue to develop its content and messaging as the hackathon comes to a close. We believe that this website could take off, _ and change lives _, empowering women and non-binary folks with otherwise difficult-to-access information. We're so grateful to the many people who have already trusted us with their information, and we are proud to launch this site!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MUCH. About backend algorithms and CSS margins vs. padding and about ourselves and how we work together, and about how much passion we can have for a small project, and how meaningful it can feel to fight for a cause through technology. Building a website that we believe can _ make a difference _ in the lives of so many, and their families, has been a joy. Being at sheHacks in particular has been an inspiring, empowering, and inclusive space. Not once did I question whether I should be here, and that is a gift that cannot be understated. I've wavered in CS, often feeling like an outside, but this weekend made me feel powerful.
