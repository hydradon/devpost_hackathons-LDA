                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted the freedom to switch around between browsers on different devices and have my bookmarks come with me, so this is a project I've always wanted to do. It's inspired by similar clients that use the popular KeePass password manager protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It comprises of an electron app and a chrome extension (currently), that allow for seamless storage, sorting and retrieval of your bookmarks. They're stored in a local JSON file which can be moved around between devices. This means I can easily store this on a cloud service and access it from all my devices, or encrypt it with my algorithm of choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desktop app is a React app presented using Electron, which deals with reading to and writing to the bookmark file. It also runs a node server (that hosts a web socket) to allow browser extensions to communicate with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of, the Chrome browser extension is just a simple piece of Javascript that connects to the desktop app's socket and sends a
                    <code>
                        newBookmark
                    </code>
                    command when the user clicks on the browser action (the button next to the address bar).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electron was a little bit tricky to set up but I managed in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also ran into weird bugs when trying to add all of the bookmarks in the bookmarks file to my redux state all at the same time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very functional app and is written using proper code (I even used a code linter).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually
                    <em>
                        want
                    </em>
                    to work on this more in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Structure of the json file is optimised for speed, I hash the web address and use that as a key.
                </p>
