                    Inspiration : Students need a fast, easy, and cheaper way to purchase new and used text books
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: provide students with a app to find new and used books
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used python to code the back end of the app and then a GUI to code the front end.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: trying to find a GUI that would work with python. We also could not get the ISBN # search to work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: For sure making the search function of the app working.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Patience !! And also that 3 sets of eyes are always better than 1.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackUCSC: hopefully to polish it and add location services.
