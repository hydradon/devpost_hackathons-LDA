                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My father building his first computer application based on Fourier image analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates a 3d plot of frequencies (colored in heat map colors, high frequencies are red and low frequencies are black).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used online examples and lots of research papers to understand FFT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matching the axes correctly so that colors would show up based on frequency instead of y coordinate of the image.
Getting image filtering to work
Getting sound files to work
Getting enough photos for fft comparison to be effective
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting something visually appealing for the 3d plot that doesn't take 15 minutes to generate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't think under time pressure; I won't be satisfied easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fast Fourier Transforms in Python
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the plots of the fourier transformed images to find the average frequency of the image/sound file, then comparing with other images/sound files to find trends. (Attempted; data size too small to gather any conclusions)
Using similarity of frequency of topographical maps in certain cities to understand how cities are made. (Attempted; couldn't find topographical maps without any markings on them)
Modifying FFT values and inverting the result to get a product with less "noise" (visual/audio) (Attempted; somewhat completed)
Analyzing TV/video to see trends in frequencies on screen (Haven't attempted)
Predict outcomes using a small amount of data (ex. location logs of a driver --&gt; prediction of location)
