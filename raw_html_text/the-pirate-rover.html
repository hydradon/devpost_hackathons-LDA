                    We were inspired by our own vision for an innovative new design that could meet the challenges posed by Northrup Grumman and an aesthetic to reflect our unique design and exploration.

                <p>
                    The Pirate Rover is designed to navigate obstacles while searching for the source of a variable EM signal.  It is built with an ultrasonic and three touch sensors to actively identify and avoid obstacles.  It is equipped with an antenna and raspberry-pi processor to collect, analyze, and then act on signals it receives to proceed in the appropriate direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the robot using components from a Qualcomm Kit, a Northrup Grumman Kit, as well as other miscellaneous parts assembled together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we faced and surpassed were integrating the raspberry pi brain with the Arduino chip.  The diverse nature of the challenges the robot was built to meet necessitated the cross platform integration.  As a result of its difficulty, its one of the parts we were most proud of.  We also had to construct a robust robot capable of adjusting its course over an obstacle filled area which was also difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of assembling the robot to full capacity in less than 24 hours, building a complicated circuit system with numerous intertwined wires, and programming the robot using raspberry-pi and python to coordinate its movements. Finally, we are proud to be helping humanity with this robot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By building this project, we furthered our concepts of raspberry-pi programming, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and effective team building. Given a specific time limit, we managed our time well by dividing the tasks between team members and spending our time and energy effectively. We productively planned the project, built its components, and refined it to correct its errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Pirate Rover will be further improved to function in a variety of applications including environments with complex obstacles, various mediums, and travelling at multiple speeds. We would also like to impact humanity in a positive way.
