                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were freshmen, we often felt like there was no reason to go to dining halls other than those closest to us (what are friends?). As upperclassmen, we felt out of the dining hall loop and rarely knew the opportune time to bully freshmen into expending their guest swipes on us...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ENTER PICKY HUSKY, a webapp that allows you to select your favorite NEU dining hall foods from thousands (yes, thousands) of options and recieve text messages on days where those foods are available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picky Husky was build using Ruby on Rails and Twilio. Yeah.
Specifically, we used nokogiri for web scraping 85 days worth of dining hall days, devise for user authentication, clockwork for job scheduling, and twilio for text messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge (and surprise) we ran into was the sheer amount of unique foods offered at NEU dining halls. Last we checked, we had 1321 different foods to render on our site in informative yet efficient ways. (Northeastern, why are you doing this???)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will eat chicken tenders every day now. Forever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Northeastern probably has a whole team of people dedicated to coming up with unique food names every day.
                </p>
