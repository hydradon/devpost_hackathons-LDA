                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pariveda's theme of making an application for social good inspired us to make the Anxiety Reliever.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chat-bot that can detect moods of people, and counsel accordingly. Also, in severe cases, the chat-bot can message or call people close to the subject and notify them of the morbid attitudes of the subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the chat-bot using rivescript and implemented the sounds and speeches using p5.speech. The website was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, AngularJS and NodeJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating all the languages and dependencies in a few web-pages was certainly a challenge. While we may have had our difficulties making everything work, we are happy to have learned all that we have from the bitter experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anxiety reliever is a website that can help people cope with their anxieties. We are delighted to have made a web-app that contributes to social good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were punished at times we did not follow programming convention. We have understood the value of proper commenting techniques and look forward to improve our coding behaviors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anxiety Reliever
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionalities, improve the natural language processing, refine the sentiment-analysis capabilities, and improve the bot as a whole.
