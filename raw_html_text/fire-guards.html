                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brother of one of our teammate is a firefighter, and he works in fire fighting command unit. Dealing with multiple requesting for help is a good topic for game. We add some some educational values, because instead of drawing map we use a Google Maps API to draw map of Krak&oacute;w.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could receive requests and send one of three cars to place of accident. We need to think about elapsing time, and that cars are specified (we shouldn't use a heavy car to pick little kitten from tree). Our command has a real place in a map, and accidents are generated randomly at all map.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pure JavaScript + HTML + little CSS
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal changes, only one person knows JS at nice level (but he resigned), and trying to make a prototype of a gameplay during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a simple prototype and we are proud in some way because during a hackathon 2 teammates had resigned.
