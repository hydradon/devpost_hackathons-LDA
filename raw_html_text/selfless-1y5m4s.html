                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all took horrible selfies before we started, and this idea was intended to help improve our skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Selfless allows for real-time selfie scoring. It allows the user to improve their selfies by providing a score for the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Android, Python-Flask, and deep learning. We used a labelled dataset of images to train our deep learning model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our dataset consisted of too much data, which caused our model taking too long to train with our limited processing power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up training the model with enough time to spare to create everything else in the application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How we could maybe improve the model so it saves us time in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for Selfless
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diving deeper into our data to suggest fixing certain attributes
