                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems from the long hours spent studying for Sean's Computer Science "weeder" classes at UC Davis freshman year. We had to hand write data structures repetitively just to practice and study for tests I know, old school right?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app allows users to practice the most popular algorithms used in the industry as well as visualize and interact with nodes just as if they were if they were the computer running the algorithm. Users can tap the nodes in the order the algorithm would be sorted and see the data structure visualize each change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this app, we aim to help beginning computer science students remember algorithms faster and reinforce their knowledge in algorithms in a fast and casual way in daily life. Currently the app demo presents insertion sort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and SpriteKit to create the nodes and Swift to link the sprites and the algorithm together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally the app was supposed to use 3d models and leap motion to create a visual yet interactive way to learn algorithms however after a couple of long hours we couldn't get the leap motion and the needed downloads to be compatible with our macbooks. 
Our main challenges with swift and XCode was the debugging and learning swift and SpriteKit along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our first Hackathon we are proud that we actually made an iOS application!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot more about XCode and the more trivial aspects of mobile app development that users may often take for granted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Visu-rithm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully more complicated algorithms/ data structures will be implemented soon like Binary Search, Max Flow, quick sort, bubble sort ect. 
We would also like to make it more user friendly.
