                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Education is the first step to empowerment for all.
Taking this into consideration, we wish to tackle one of the major UN goals -
                    <strong>
                        Quality Education
                    </strong>
                    .
Using state of the art technologies to reach the above mentioned goal is what motivated the genesis of this hack. 
Our vision is to empower disadvantaged students in the world who are falling behind due to outdated teaching methodologies and lack of practical knowledge.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, we realize that high hardware cost of any product would tend to make it a rare commodity than a utility. So we decided to focus on AR for our implementation, unlike it's counterpart- VR.
                    <br>
                    Why? Simply because the developer controls the virtual environment in VR, whereas user gets all the power to control their environment using AR! We strongly believe AR will allow us to bridge the gap between students from all sectors of the society and give them access to innovations in learning.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest impacts of AR ,in the near future, can be felt through the distribution and availability of education. Thus, we have created an AR classroom solution connecting teachers with students over a portal allowing them to have a real-time interaction with objects augmented in their environment and network with their peers over Messenger.
                    <br>
                    These objects can range from augmenting mathematical 3D shapes to augmenting complex laboratory experiments, for which the actual equipment may prove to be too expensive to afford. We have demonstrated a use-case scenario of a Biology lesson on parts of the human brain wherein the movements made by the teacher over the AR platform will be replicated for the students on their simulators.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We used AR Studio to interact with Augmenting Reality objects in the real space and perform practical lab training over an AR model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Internet of Things to create a publisher subscriber model to reflect the changes in the AR Model happening on teacher's end, to the student's app end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We even projected the AR model in unity for desktop based version
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used REACT and node.js to create a responsive and interactive web portal, which aligned the teachers with the students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The backend handled the IoT requests too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We incorporated the Facebook messenger chatbox &amp; Facebook page plug into the web portal to create a collaborative class forum and manage class events.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Creating a coordinate collision system for virtual objects and real objects in AR studio was the most time consuming task, apparently the tool doesn't allow to use the generic bounding box collisions, therefore we came up with indigenous mathematical way to fulfill the requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrating the AR model on a web portal (Not in this version of the app)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrating the AR Studio with non-https server

                    <li>
                        We used the AR studio and created a spatial coordinate system algorithm to interact with the digital/virtual objects in real space with the hand-tracking of the AR studio.

                    <li>
                        We interacted with real NGO specialists who are using Digital platforms to provide equitable education all over the world, and gained real insights in the subject matter

                    <li>
                        We learned a great deal about the coordinate systems of virtual and real world objects and how to bridge the interaction between them
