                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our team's drive to create a greener world for future generations. Since some of us are from SoCal, we wanted to make a project that can benefit cities with a growing garbage issue, such as Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an arduino with a light sensor to detect if a garbage can is full. If so, it will send a signal via wi-fi to our web client indicating which garbage can is full and where it's located. From the web client we can greate an efficient route for curbside garbage pickup. With this data we can analyze a particular city and find troublesome areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used arduino to send a wireless signal. From there, the web client uses the Google Maps API to handle the map display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the wifi components and having it connected consistently was a problem for the backend team. For frontend, we were inexperienced with JavaScript so that held back progress. As someone who doesn't work with JavaScript, the front end team ran into issues with asynchronous calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning JavaScript and how to have this entire project work autonomously based on the garbage can's trash level.
