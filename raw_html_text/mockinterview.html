                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women usually don't play at their strengths. Especially during job interviews, women tend to underestimate their ability even when they have the skills needed for the job.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform is designed to provide women and anyone who can use encouragement with necessary behavioral interview skills and the ability to reflect on their performance during the mock interviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a speech recognition API and performed feature extractions from sample interviews we collected at the hackathon, then used NLTK Python library to train our machine learning algorithm to score the answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we took a naive approach to machine learning and faced the problem of gathering necessary information from our data. Luckily, we used our networking skills to find the 'sixth member' of the team to happen to have ML expertise. Currently, we are collaborative creating an effective ML model.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our agility as developers to adapt to unexpected pivots in the course towards the completion of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the majority of us have no prior experience with machine learning, this project is a foundation for us to build our knowledge of ML, and all of us are excited to continue developing our skills in this growing field.
                </p>

                    What's next for Interview Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to further expand the range of question our algorithm can analyze as well as conduct more training to enhance its accuracy. The next step would be partnering up with various professionals in HR fields to track the impact that our platform makes for the participants along with gaining data samples for our product to better reflect the real world.
