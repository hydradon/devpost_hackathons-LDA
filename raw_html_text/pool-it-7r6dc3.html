                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the problem of peer-to-peer transactions.  We sought to fix this be creating an app that allows you to easily fund your friend's events.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    You or your friend posts an event, he gives it a title, description, and a money amount that is needed.  This will appear to your friends on the main board.  They can look at this event and choose to donate to it or not.  If they choose to donate, they will be put on the contributed list and be invited.  This is perfect for smaller events with friends, such as a barbecue or a small video game tournament.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Android Studio and Amazon web services.  We also implemented the Capital One's Nessie API, BCrypt API, and the Amazon web services API.  We used teamwork and communication to divvy up what needed to be done and as a result of it completed things in a timely manner.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had a problem with the creation of the project.  Apparently, the project creation partially failed and a lot of Gradle stuff was missing, which we didn't find out about until a couple hours in.  We had problems with accessing the database for Amazon Web Services.  We currently do not have enough time to fix this so we are using sample data.  We also had problems with the GUI as the GUI for our app required a lot of work and design.  We mostly just ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually did a lot of work for the project and we are really proud of it. The GUI looks really nice even though it isn't fully complete.  A lot of the back end stuff is complete and took a lot of work to get done.  We are also proud of the idea, we think it is a really good one that could go really far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android Studio and how to develop on it.  We also learned a lot about how to import and use APIs in Android Studio.  We learned a lot about GUIs and how to use them and work them for a mobile application.  Finally, we learned a lot about NoSQL and how to use databases with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to fix the remaining issues and continue this app and eventually release it for public use.
