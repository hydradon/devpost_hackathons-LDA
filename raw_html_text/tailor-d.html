                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were brainstorming for ideas, we really wanted to create something that was fun to make as well as functional and meaningful. A lot of our ideas were too much of one or the other, such as a chrome extension that would change images into pictures of animals or dank memes. We then found an idea that was a great combination of both, something that applied to our daily lives, and an application that we could actually potentially use in the future. And so TAILOR'D began.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TAILOR'D focuses on making the most important choice of the day an easy decision; choosing the outfit you'll wear! With an auto-generating closet based on complementary color palettes, and an easy way to view your closet virtually, you'll never spend too long trying on outfits in the morning again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For TAILOR'D, we used Ionic as a framework for an iOS app. With Ionic, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code the front end and all of the user interface/interaction. The backend, written in Python and using Flask, determined which images matched the color palettes and returned that information to our front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problems getting started with the Ionic interface, since only one member had experience with front end work. We also had some problems with Flask and connecting our application to Heroku so that we could all connect to the server and run the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we were able to finish the application and get it all working. We were able to code almost all of the features we had imagined having, so that was awesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML: divs. CSS: is hard. JavaScript: is kinda cool. Python: awesome as always. Designers: never take them for granted. Video-ing: presentation is key.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tailor'd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on hitting the app store Feb 31, 2016 ;). Jokes aside, we actually really like our application and hope to expand it further this semester.
