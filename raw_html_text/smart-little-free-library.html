                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon along with it being the first at this school, so we were really unprepared. 
We decided to combine an idea and try to make it 'smart'.
Not a lot of people read in the US anymore. A lot of youth today isn't as involved with books as later generations. Rather than go the scholastic book fair route we chose to start within our own neighborhoods.  We aimed to change that with the use of little free libraries.   (
                    <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://littlefreelibrary.org/
                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to add some sensors to make the library smart.
We have two versions.
One is with a LCD and the other is with an ultrasonic sensor with servo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LCD build:
Below you will see the photo with the 'bugs' we got but the LCD outputs 
Have you read 
and Book count: 0 at the beginning of the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program is made in an event-style paradigm. 
when the photo-resistor (Going to be a reed switch to simulate opening the door to the library) is low it enters a new state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The door is open state: 
The lights turn on (red white blue (merica)) and the midi song of Zelda - opening a chest song. LCD shows take a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When door is closed and state is still 'OPEN'
slowly dim the lights and close the door and say goodbye
                </p>
                <p>
                    re-enter await state and show have you read today and book count that reflects potential readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultra sonic sensor build:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program is made in an event-style paradigm. 
when the ultra sonic sensor  shows 10 cms (a person is near)  it enters a new state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A person is near state
The servo opens the door then the lights turn on (red white blue (merica)) and the midi song of Zelda - opening a chest song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When person walks away and state is still 'OPEN'
slowly dim the lights and close the door and
                </p>
                <p>
                    re-enter await state reading from the ultrasonic sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wiring diagrams from online to combine ideas and make them work. We also made our own (xml
                    <a href="https://draw.io" rel="nofollow">
                        https://draw.io
                    </a>
                    diagram) circuit after we learned some new concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through lots of trial and error we were able combine all of our modules into different builds of the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LCD gets noise (shown below) and shows random characters. We never got around to solving this due to time. As the circuit ran it would slowly add random characters in random places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We didn't have any supplies so we had to use the swag stickers to hold our "door" (piece of cardboard) to our servo.
We also reused some donut boxes from this morning to "recycle" and make a makeshift little library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We couldn't go to home depot and make one so we made a prototype. Also we are poor.
