                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UBC is quite a large school and for newer students and visitors, it may be hard to find some buildings on campus. Our 
inspiration for this project is to find a creative way to render a map that will soften the burden of finding buildings at UBC.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a map that has a creative way of rendering building names and we are working towards a friendly user interface. However, since we are inexperienced it is still a work in progress.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at different examples and came to a consensus on the way we wanted to develop the app. Since we all knew java, we decide to code in this language. During this experience, we all learned many new ways to use the language including the use of running simulators and complex debugging.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of rendering a search option for the map as none of us were able to accomplish the task.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a somewhat appealing rendering and finished the project on time.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned many new aspects of java including running mobile apps using SDK's.

                <p>
                    Our next step is to make a more friendly user interface and a better rendering of the image.
