                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was that sometimes it was difficult for us to decide what restaurant to eat at here in West Layafette, and this app makes it easier to choose where to eat based on a few parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes into account multiple user inputted parameters and selects a place to eat, displaying information on the restaurant such as the hours it is open and a few menu items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Android Studio, Java, XML, and Git to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many bugs with Android Studio, and it took a while to figure out what worked in Android Studio, and what didn't, because it is very specific with many of its statements and syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making a fully functional app that solves a problem which we were running into, which was not knowing what restaurant to eat at. We are also proud of persevering through many of the bugs that we ran into and not giving up, even when it seemed like we weren't going to finish the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Git and Android Studio, and we feel very confident utilizing these technologies in the future due to our usage of them in this hackathon to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Restaurant Search Engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate more parameters into our search engine, and we want to include more information about the restaurant after it is selected. We also plan to incorporate the Google Maps API in order to display more information about each restaurant. Another idea to improve the app would be to display a list of restaurants on the second page, and allow the user to choose which restaurant they prefer, as the current app selects what it thinks is best based on the parameters given.
