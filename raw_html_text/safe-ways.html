                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the rising number of cars in our roads, too congested roads, and also by the increasing number of accidents in the last years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our service is an API that provides directions from A to B and within the directions a safety score is provided, being able to compare them and choose the less risky one. This helps in building a safest city with less traffic congestion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the data sets of car accidents and incidents reported by Guardia Urbana on Open Data Barcelona of the latest years. We divided Barcelona in a grid and assigned a risk score to each square using Python and storing the results in a database (Dynamodb). On the other side we got a routing service (OSRM) providing the directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This service can be accessed through an exposed Express.js API, taking only two parameters: origin and destination. We also built a frontend for this service demonstrating one of its uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some troubles adjusting the dimension of our resources at AWS at first. And then connecting the API with a functional frontend to showcase the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having starting a project from scratch and having been able to deliver a working product. It has been a challenge for us, as we had never built an API before with AWS technology behind. We are also proud of having the opportunity to set up a minimal demonstration of how this service can help people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about positioning and how to work with coordinates: calcs, partitioning, sizing, storing, etc. and to process a public data set to have a consistent database.
                </p>
