                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed the immersion of the Elder Scrolls series and thought that by using the Alexa I could immerse myself and others on a new level.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Informs the user of the current date within the fictional world of the Elder Scrolls Series.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the skill using Python, the ask-flask library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While writing the skill I realized that not all users will be on the same time zone as where the skill is being hosted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is not my first skill and both of the skills I have created are pretty basic. However, I'm still proud of this skill as I used what I learned from my first and created this in about an hour.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have not worked much in Python and mostly did these project to learn python and increase my experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tamriel Calendar Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to implement a way to query a database to find the next holiday from the lore. I also want to add the ability for the skill to use the users local time.
