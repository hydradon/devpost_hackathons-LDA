                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We must protect the memes if we wish to continue following the internets Meme Dream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dank Swipe allows the user to upload and sell their own dank memes for Danks(currency). It also allows the user to vote on other peoples memes, and even invest in the memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it our platform out of huge amounts of blood, dank, and meme. To power these heavy dependencies, we built it on ruby on rails, postgres, and javascript on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was designing the model layout to allow the trading and profiting off of memes. Countless migrations were generated before final committing of the migrations to master.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how memetastic the platform has become. Not only is it powered by static memes, but it takes advantage of our memetastic users to drive the content of the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that you really should come into a hackathon with a plan. Changing projects at 4am hurts. Bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DankSwipe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to fork it for future security testing purposes, as well as future production development. This way we can get the best of both worlds: A learning platform, and a production "fun" platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    PLEASE NOTE:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This version has some bugs that we have intentionally not patched yet. We plan to use this as a platform for teaching web security on enterprise applications. Please see Bobby for details.
