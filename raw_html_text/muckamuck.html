                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by the challenge of building a better city where the majority of people is more involved in the political decision making. We want to make the opinion of the public visible for the decision makers through easily understandable info-graphics before the actual time of voting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the people to give their opinion on every matter that gets voted on in municipal and parliamentary decision making in a simplified way. Our app allows the further analysis of public opinion through the demographic information of the users. The fact that the data extracted from our app is fully transparent from the demographic perspective makes it superior to the non-transparent data provided by the traditional political surveys.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using APIs to municipal and parliamentary decision making data, Android studio, and visual mock-ups. We built a web application and database to retrieve and hold data from the RSS feed of the Finnish parliament and a table for gathering user specific shadow voting data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to present the complicated renditions of public decision making to the public in a simplified manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the way we will democratize the world by allowing people to shadow vote on the matters of public decision making before the actual vote by the actual representatives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the matters of public decision making are usually very complex. When presented to the public, the matters have to be simplified and broken down to sub-matters for easy opinion forming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Muckamuck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will develop the way in which we re-structure the complex items in the public decision making so that they can be better understood by the majority of people.
