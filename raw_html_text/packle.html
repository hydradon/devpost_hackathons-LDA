                    The app is the worlds long awaited solution to those pesky airlines, charging us, ruining our precious bags, crushing our carry on luggage in their tiny checkers. Well we say no more. With our app you can now see which airlines shall discriminate against your bags size and weight no longer do we have to put up with our bags being called 'Plus sized' being told they 'need to go in the hold' or the worst, your bag is simply to big. So take this app and make a stand! Make a stand with packle!
