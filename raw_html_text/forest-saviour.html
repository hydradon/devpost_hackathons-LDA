                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the Amazon suffers, human suffering isn't too far behind. Recent amazon wildfires left a lasting impact on all of us. We wanted to do something to mitigate the fires and protect our forests.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system utilises IBM weather channel predictions to confirm the probability of an occurrence of a wildfire. Once it does it remotely activates the sensors deployed in the fire prone area to detect the onset of a fire before it spreads. If the detection proves to be true it will open a communication portal to alert concerned authorities as well as the people who are at a high risk of being caught in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by inferring data from the weather channel that will help predict the likelihood of a wildfire. If the likelihood is high it will switch on the Arduino board to detect the environmental conditions using the sensor network. Upon sensing a fire this Arduino will open a communication network and will alert all concerned parties.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of communication models and related hardware equipments created a bit of a tussle.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully designed an IOT system capable of detecting fires while at an early stage and containing the fire by sending out early warnings to all concerned civilians and authorities.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to integrate different sensors. We learnt how to use APIs.

                    What's next for Kaapaan.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work further on the system with all the necessary hardware requirements and give it the ability to work to it's fullest potential.
