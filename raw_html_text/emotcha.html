                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently had to use a captcha and was frustrated by how many tries it took me to prove that I wasn't a robot. Then it hit me, why are we looking at squigly text, what's more human than emotions? I had just looked through indico.io's list of apis and saw that they had a facial emotion detection api and it looked pretty doable to implement, so I thought why not create a proof of concept for the first emotional captcha.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emotcha shows a user an image of a human's face and the emotional profile of the face. Next to that is a live webcam view of the user and a stream of their emotional profile. Once the profiles match, the user is able to login to the mock website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The indico api expects just faces, so I had to implement live facial localization into the algorithm. Doing this while also fighting to keep the webcam view as smooth as possible was quite challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the general user experience of the proof of concept, that it just works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to implement a variety of powerful tools, indico.io's apis, materialize's beautiful css framework, and facial detection
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emotcha
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to make it responsive (cause it really isn't, curse of being a backend guy) and perhaps package it up on npm so that other developers could actually use it in the future
