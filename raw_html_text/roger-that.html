                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our personal experiences and the desire to improve the daily life of every one.

                    RogerThat! is an app that allows users to independently install and maintain their smart devices through the assistance of image recognition technology. Image recognition allows us to identify different/complicated components that are foreign to the non-technical user, and to tell them in easy and friendly terms the different steps required for installation/maintenance. We believe that RogerThat!'s use case is not only applicable to the installation and maintenance of Wi-Fi routers, but also Rogers' TV and home phones.

                    <li>
                        Tech side faced hiccups in terms of scraping and search engine without APIs. there were problems which were minor but hindered the thought and work process still
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Biz side faced challenges with coming up with a storyline in 3 minutes and learning how to prioritize what to pitch within 3 minutes

                    <li>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used design thinking and learnt machine learning during the course of this hackathon in order to build our Proof of Concept. Additionally, our diverse team with different skillsets required us to leverage on each others' skills and to work together to build something amazing.
