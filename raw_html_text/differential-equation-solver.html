                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mr. Ricardo's class tortured the Year 4 Physics Olympiad students with a series of differential equation exercises, however, the students cannot find one such differential equation solver with steps that is free and open source. Thus, we wish to help the students a little bit in their learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It differentiates single-variable expressions, find complex roots of single-variable polynomial and solves linear homogeneous differential equations. It also include steps to solve the differential equations.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The program is written mainly in C, but the UI is written in Java.

                        The process of displaying an output is insane: to convert from human readable string into latex with regex and finally insert into HTML using java requires 8 backslashes to output just one backslash.
