                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming ideas for HooHacks when we found ourselves with a wall full of sticky notes, which were hard to organize. This led us to the idea of a knowledge graph that could help anyone with notes get organized. It would be especially helpful for students to upload their notes, look at the conceptual connections, and see what they are missing in relation to the notes everyone else took. In addition, teachers could identify students that were weak in notetaking, or emphasize important topics that most students missed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoteNodes is a webapp that works on mobile and desktop browser. It is best used with a smartphone, when users can take photos of their handwritten notes. Then, on another view in the app, they can view the knowledge graph with theirs and everyone else's notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Platform for the OCR and Entity Extraction, and  for the graph database that fit our needs perfectly. For the web app, we used a  Flask and React stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get started with  since none of us had experience with it before. We also ran into more issues with it later when we were trying to visualize the data in the frontend. NPM took a long time to compile when we added new packages, which caused us to have slower iteration towards the final product.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to see the results of the Google Cloud Platform services be displayed on our frontend. In addition, we are proud of the functional pipeline that we created, from taking pictures of notes to them being visualized on the knowledge graph.
