                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After suffering the frustrations of trying to efficiently deal with out of hours call outs (juggling of numbers, calendars, email, etc) with just a phone where many apps don't talk to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses existing on-call information shared via Outlook calendars to populate a list of up-to-date and relevant contacts who can be dialled at the touch of a button.  Adds in automated email auditing to finish the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the new Microsoft Office 365 APIs to interact with both Calendar and Email for users.  It's a native app built in Java based on some of the example programs in the Office dev centre.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not a Java programmer and pretty new to Android so it took a fair old while to get my head around the examples and get modify them for my needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly just glad I got something working!  Also, this is based on a real-world issue that I have encountered many times at work so, with a bit more work, it would be good to put it to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fair bit of Java.  Although anyone reading my source code disagree.  Also, first ever time making a video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Callout Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few changes to be sure but then will put it to use.  Next will be a companion app to make it easier for those on-call to be able to manage their contact numbers and schedules, etc
