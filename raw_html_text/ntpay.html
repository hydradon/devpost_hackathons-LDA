                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help merchants and their customers to improve the shopping experience by reducing wait times and bringing the shopping experience into the 21st century.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open the app as you walk into a shop, it will use GPS to work out which store you're in. Use the app to scan the barcodes of the products you pick up as you walk through the store, it will show you everything in your basket along with a running total. When you're ready to checkout just tap 'Pay' and authenticate with the biometric security on your phone and you can talk out of the store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend API was built with Laravel and the front end is a JavaScript application packaged with Cordova.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we lost 2 of our team members due to illness and while we found one more we realised we had to switch project as we were struggling with the API (we started on the Space track). We had difficulties with getting the barcode scanner to work within the Ionic framework and we also had difficulties with getting the project finished on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working API (for managing shops, users, baskets, etc.), an app design &amp; branding. I'm also proud of how well the team has worked together considering the circumstances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all learned about how to work as a team when things don't go to plan. We have also all learned new technical skills, for example I (Pete) had not used the Ionic framework before this weekend and even though we didn't use it in the end I would certainly use it again in future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ntPay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to get to a working prototype, which is what we were aiming for this weekend. It would be awesome to show this to some shops too. The app also needs to be paired with a computer vision security system to prevent theft.
