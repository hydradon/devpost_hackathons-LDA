                    this system will enable student's, class representatives, lecturer's, university admin, and other stuffs to stay connected no matter where they are.

                <p>
                    in building the web system we will use HTML5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT for the front end design, and Laravel PHP framework, Mysql DB on the backend.
on the mobile app side we will use the popular framework called React Native which will enable us to build our app for different platforms.
