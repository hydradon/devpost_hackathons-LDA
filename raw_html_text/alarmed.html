                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things that most people struggle with in life is waking up in the morning. Most people already have alarms on their phones or on their clocks, however these options make it very easy to hit the snooze button and go back to sleep. Because of this many people usually end up setting up many alarms and will still sometimes sleep through them. We wanted to fix this problem and so we decided to create an alarm clock that would be much harder to turn off, it would take some thinking in order to turn this alarm off therefore making sure that you awake.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project will show the time like a regular clock  and has an alarm that can be set to whenever the user wants. The user also sets the password they wish to use to turn off the alarm. When the clock reaches the time set to turn on a fan will turn on that will annoy the user until they wake up. The fan will continue to blow until the user has input the four digit code they saved.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Uno to create our project, along with an IR reciever and remote to send the code the user must enter. We used an LCD display and led's to display the time and show the user their progress in inputting the password.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge that we ran into was getting a buzzer to work along with IR receiver. Having both together on the board was giving us many issues and in the end we were unable to get the buzzer to work as an alarm.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment that I am really proud of is being able to code the LCD correctly to update the time every second making sure that the correct time is displayed.

                    What's next for Alarmed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Alarmed is to figure out how to get the buzzer to work in our Arduino and perhaps find  a better screen that would be more user friendly.
