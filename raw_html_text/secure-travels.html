                </h2>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used solidity to build the back-end and html/js for the front-end and tried to use Web3 to hook them up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running the program and connecting to it from a front-end. This is difficult since Blockchains usually have many people mining on it (making things happen, otherwise code isn't executed).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We got the hard part! (Blockchain, I think XD)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How BlockChain technology and Cryptocurrencies work. Why they're effective.

                    What's next for Secure Travels

                    We plan to incorporate our own cryptocurrency within the system.
