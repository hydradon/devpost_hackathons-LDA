                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is to add more layers to our croissant (ourself) using the assistant (Jean-Pierre). We wanted to create something that would build good habits with a friendlier source of encouragement. We felt as though a lot of habit tracking resources were too robotic and a friendlier approach would make it easier to keep up with habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application keeps our users conscious about their daily activities by providing an intimate companion, so that you can make better informed choices every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gave birth to the charismatic, friendly, and helpful friend that is Jean-Pierre the Croissistant using powerful SMS messaging API from Twilio, and we implemented him using the Python Flask framework. To give Jean-Pierre information about your free time so that he can advise you on when you should go out and complete your tasks, we used the Google Calendar API to find out when the user has free time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the creation of our project, we ran into a variety of challenges, such as running into bugs in our program and learning how to integrate APIs into our project. It was our first time interacting with APIs, and so it took us time to learn how to use APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our graphics and our development throughout the project. Although we were unable to completely finish our project and integrate all the aspects we wanted, we're proud of how much we were able to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs through integrating Twilio's messaging API and Google Calendar API in our project. 
We learned the process of brainstorming, considering all the ideas, and eventually coming to a finalized project. We had a lot of changes throughout creating the project as well, and we needed to adapt to the changes. Additionally, we learned how to work in a team, as for some of us it was the first time we worked on a group project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crossist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further integrate the aspects we did not have enough time for, such as tracking the number of times the client does a task, a priority queue for the tasks, and online website use tracking.
