                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us have wanted to have lunch with someone else, so that we could meet new people outside of our friend circle.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app brings people together to have meals or events together.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We have both an iOS and web app. We used codePen and XCode to build the two interfaces. We implemented google firebase for backend data.

                <p>
                    We managed to work together to finish the project, all while having to learn all the code we used as it was mostly all new to us.
