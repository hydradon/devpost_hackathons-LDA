                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us participated in Marching Band last year. One of the major problems we experienced as performing musicians was memorizing our "dots" on the field. It was crucial to memorize our dots, but it was difficult to both visualize the field and memorize numbers at the same time. We decided to harness our coding skills and create a program that can help us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows marching students to add their own sets to the program and test themselves with a visual aid. This includes yard lines in the football fields we had to account for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a combination of Java and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to find a way to combine the formations on the field and quizzing the user for their dots.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to combine everything into a working program and creating a program we could actually use this year.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use JavaScript, utilize our time effectively, and pull an all-nighter.

                <p>
                    We plan to incorporate music and metronomes into our program to help students memorize their music as well.
