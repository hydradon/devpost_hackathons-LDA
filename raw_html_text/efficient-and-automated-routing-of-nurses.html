                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After talking to optum, we decided it would be an interesting project to apply graph theory and linear algebra to solve the problem of distributing nurses effectively
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inputs a pool of nurses and distributes them to care for patients as efficiently as possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using linear algebra techniques such as page-rank algorithms and adjacency matrices to optimize the number of places a nurse can visit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applying numerical linear algebra/algorithms and linking front-end development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using multiple Linear algebra algorithms numerically to get a solution we know is efficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tkinter in python and different numerical algorithms

                    What's next for Efficient and automated routing of nurses
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more friendly front-end, efficient computing, and better storage/linking to database
                </p>
