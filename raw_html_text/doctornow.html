                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In such a technologically influenced world, members of society have greater opportunities when it comes to accessing necessities on demand. However, such a luxury can be absent in underdeveloped third world nations, where even receiving proper medical attention can be an unrealistic reality for most individuals. Due to the technological segregation cased by the economic situation in these nations, most individuals are unable to receive proper medical assistance that could have otherwise prevented terminal illnesses from occurring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where individuals in developed nations have the ability to access medical attention straight from the palm of their hand, our goal was to design a product that bridge the medical segregation individuals in third worlds face by providing them the ability to access medical attention easily.

                    We decided to build a web application to connect patients to doctors over video. The ideology was that we would have nurses check in patients in a clinic and note any physical symptoms and conditions for the doctor to
