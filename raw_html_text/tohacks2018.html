                    For this hackathon we decided to tackle the third challenge - breaking barriers within communities around the world. When you think of breaking barriers, you think of language. This idea usually evolves into using some sort of text translation project, or maybe even voice-to-text translation. However, we decided to target a less common issue. Giving the visually impaired the freedom to play around, and create their own music (similar to Garage Band).

                    "Music is the universal language of all mankind." - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Our hackathon project for TOHacks2018 (12 hour hackathon) is an online music creation software for the visually impaired. This application allows the user to create piano music using the keyboard while being guided by audio instructions. Voice recognition is also a feature of this software, as the user can voice their request for certain "tracks" to be played.
