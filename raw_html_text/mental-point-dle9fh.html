                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A representative from the Canadian Mental Health Association informed our group that a lot of the time doctors don't have enough time to gather sufficient information about how their patients are feeling before making a diagnosis (only 15 minutes). We decided to create an app that would enable both the patients and doctors to track the mental health level of the patients over days, weeks, or months.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed questions using both scales from 1-10 and rankings of emoji. These questions were developed based on symptoms provided by the cmha website. A full list of the questions can be found here:
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aLX6oJ6RaylOxRdZMC85XOmek8QnJhIHblBELqlLPVQ/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    . The user's daily answers are stored and graphed in the results tab. This way the user can track how their emotions and physical symptoms are changing over time. A prototype of the graphical representation along with the user's data in a spreadsheet can be found here:

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript ionic framework to create an app that can also be used as a website, for greater user accessibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we were going to use react native to design our app, but the template we were using was too difficult to understand in 24 hours. We started to design the app, but then decided to look for an easier development platform. We found ionic, and after learning more about it, we found it much easier to understand, and stuck with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was all of our first mobile app, and we got many features to work, so we're very proud of that.
We learned a new language (ionic), and worked through problems together.
                    <br>
                    We also worked together well; we all came in not knowing each other at all and together worked as a great team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If one way to do something fails, there's always another way, so don't just give up when it's hard and decide to do a website.
Everyone has different ideas and ways of helping the team progress.

                    What's next for Mental Point -CMHA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to implement a print results option so a patient could print a document for their doctor with well organized information explaining each graph that they could give as a summary to their doctor, and that their doctor could keep as a hardcopy. We'd also like to tailor inspirational messages or health advice on the app based on what areas the patient is struggling in. Also, we'd like to let the user decide if and when the app should send them push notifications reminding them to complete their daily survey.
