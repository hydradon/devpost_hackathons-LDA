                    Inspiration and how it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people use bikes to travel around London but sometimes you may have to spend more than you want to. The tfl bike system charges extra for not parking in the bike after 30 minutes. The purpose of the app is to provide a route to be able to park the bike every 30 mins, avoiding any extra charges.

                <h2>
                    How we built it and challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by using android studio to create an app using google maps. The next step we took was creating tracking system so that the app knows the current location of the user. We then added configurations so that the user can click to the destination they want to go to. The first major challenge we experienced was creating a JSON parser specifically for tfl&rsquo;s bike point API. After spending a long time we finally managed. After that we had to fiddle around with the Async settings which delayed us a bit further. We then had to build a second parser for google API so that we could accurately calculate the timings between several points. We then wrote an algorithm that would find the most effective route between a start and end point which also saves money for the user in the process.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to write a JSON parser and then using the information to provide live updates and feedback.

                <h2>
                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This can help more people to consider cycling instead of using more polluting methods of transport as they would save money in the process too.
