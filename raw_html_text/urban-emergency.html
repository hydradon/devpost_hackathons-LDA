                <h3>
                    Imagine if there was an Alexa input point at every street corner and you need help ...
                </h3>

                    And imagine you have been robbed .... of your cell phone.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Imagine you are having a heart attack and cannot dial a phone.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Imagine you are a child and don't have a cell phone and there are no public pay phones.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Imagine there is a network failure due to terrorist or natural disaster.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Imagine your cellphone battery is at 1% ...
                </h4>
                <h3>
                    and imagine all you had to do was say: "Alexa - HELP!"
                </h3>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    node.js + Lambda + Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    'Help' is a reserved Alexa word and there is not a reasonable substitute. We imagine that AWS would help us in making an exception for this use case.
