                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making decision is a taught process for everyone
                </p>

                    Our project may predict your future, just spin the wheel and read your fortune
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used a sound detector device to capture the sound. When a user finishes to say a question, the wheel starts spinning ( in a randomly selected time slot). We have used a GearBox to simulate the spinning of a wheel. When the wheel stops, we print the corresponding fortune on the LCD screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was to recognise when the user finishes speaking, and start the wheel rotation accordingly. Due to the sound of the GearBox, the sound detector took it as a question and did not stop spinning the wheel.  The second challenge was detecting on which part of the wheel is the arrow showing at the end and displaying the proper message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making a wheel that starts rotation only after a user finishes his/hers question and displaying the "fortune". We are also able to calibrate the sound detector at the beginning, so that it will not take into account the ground noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to work with different Arduino components, connect them and using them with the Arduino API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fortune Wheel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the "fortune" detection,  by making more accurate the slice detection from the wheel.
