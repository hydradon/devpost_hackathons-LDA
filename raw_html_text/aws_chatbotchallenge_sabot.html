                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SA bot is executed as a single lambda function.
Lambda checks the user information obtained from Lex with the user list stored in S3 and checks whether it is a registered member or not.
If you are a registered user, use the Google Calendar API to retrieve team member schedule information.
Based on retrieved schedule information, display on slack's team channel or add schedule to team member's calendar.
When a new member joins the team, you can check the schedule of the new member by setting the Google calendar sharing settings and adding it to the member list stored in S3.
