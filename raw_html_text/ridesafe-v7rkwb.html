                    What it does - This app automatically calculates the safety score of the driver based on the stats provided by the Arity drive engine SDK and the speed limit from mapquest for each of the route driven. Ride sharing services like lyft and uber will use this safety score in their app to automatically allocate the safest driver to the riskiest root which get calculated in the app using the risk API. This will also help uber reward the drivers who drive safely and take action against the riskiest drivers.
