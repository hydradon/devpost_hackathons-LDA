                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make physical mail as convenient as email.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When mail arrives at a dorm or apartment building, it is dropped off into our machine. Using a webcam and optical character recognition, we parse the text on the outside of the envelope and look for a relevant name. If we find a match in our database, we send that person an email notifying them that a letter has arrived for them.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a really difficult computer vision problem! Even one of the best open-source libraries, Google Tesseract, has a lot of trouble on handwritten mail and requires substantial preprocessing to images.

                    Under the right conditions, text is properly recognized! Also tying together hardware and many different software components.

                <p>
                    We're hoping to add spam mail detection, and more helpful emails to our users (i.e sending them a picture of both sides of the envelope).
