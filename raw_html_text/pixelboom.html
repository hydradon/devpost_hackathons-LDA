                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to play a game like this when I was younger. It was an online game and very competitive. I wasn't very good and the game was heading toward the pay-to-win direction. I found the game very fun but couldn't keep up as many players are willing to pay for more powerful items. I really like the concept, which drives me to make this game where I can play fairly with my friends without the pay-to-win aspect. Or maybe I could give myself a "little" bit of advantage since I'm the creator? :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is essentially a Worms game clone. It is a multiplayer game where player takes turn shooting each other. The terrain is destructible therefore players can be killed by either having no health left or falling off the map.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Unity2D. The physics such as destructible terrain, player movement, bullet trajectory, collision detection are all made from scratch.They might not be very optimised...
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pixel perfect collision between the player, projectile, and the level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making original sprite.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unity Engine as a whole because I don't use it much.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Hopefully a complete game at the end of this hackathon
## What I learned
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unity Camera system.
## What's next for PixelBoom
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Maybe it can be hosted somewhere, optimised, more features and become an online multiplayer instead of local.
