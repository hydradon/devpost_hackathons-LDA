                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that in order for the blockchain to really be considered transparent extracting data from it needs to be more straightforward for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also believe that just transactional data is not enough, but also the execution of smart contracts needs to be accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform allows its users to query the Ethereum Blockchain as they would a time series database, empowering them with both transactional and execution data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by extracting execution data from go-ethereum and showcasing its power by querying MakerDAO execution data and comparing it with the price of Ethereum in order to see if there is a correlation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coda
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The focus on this hackathon was to build the technical pieces on which we can build products on top.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coda can now go in two directions:
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Consumer app
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Leverage the infrastructure that we built with a user-friendly app for non-technical users that allows them to get events of their interest based on the execution of smart contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that case, our main audience would be crypto traders that need insight from the execution of smart contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We estimate there are ~30M crypto traders, assuming we charge them 29$ a month our TAM would be $10.4B.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Enterprise
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The second option that we have is to focus on selling custom data streams with smart contracts execution data to enterprise customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, we would be charging based on the data consumed, the complexity of the queries
                </p>
