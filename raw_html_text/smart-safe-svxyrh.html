                    There are buildings that have secure safes in them for people to store valuables, such as hotels and residential flats, where the users of the safe will possibly change often. This means that the codes on these safes will be reset on a regular or semi-regular basis. Especially with hotel rooms where many people will have access to the room that are not necessarily the person staying in the room it creates a large security flaw, all one of these many people need is to be able to reset a safe password to steal the contents of that safe. By putting the safe on a network you can eliminate that security risk by removing the manual reset of the password. Whilst this opens other security risks that must also be taken into account it closes off many avenues of attack a malicious actor may have when trying to break into the safe.
