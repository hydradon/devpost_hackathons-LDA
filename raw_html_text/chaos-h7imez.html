                    Ricky and I are big fans of the software culture. It's very open and free, much like the ideals of our great nation. As U.S. military veterans, we are drawn to software that liberates the oppressed and gives a voice to those unheard.

                        Senate Joint Resolution 34
                    </strong>
                    is awaiting ratification from the President, and if this happens, internet traffic will become a commodity. This means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will have the capability of using their users' browsing data for financial gain. This is a clear infringement on user privacy and is diametrically opposed to the idea of an open-internet. As such, we decided to build
                    <strong>
                        chaos
                    </strong>
                    , which gives a voice... many voices to the user. We feel that it's hard to listen in on a conversation in a noisy room.

                    By using our own custom browser, we are able to dispatch a lightweight headless browser that mimics human-computer interaction, making its behavior indistinguishable from our user's behavior. There are two modes:

                    . The first mode scrambles requests at an average of 50 sites per minute. The second mode scrambles requests at an average of 300 sites per minute, and stops at 9000 sites. We use a dynamically-updating list of over

                    Chaos is built on top of the chaos.js engine that we've built, a new approach to WebKit-driven headless browsing. Chaos is
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    indiscernible from a human user. All traffic coming from Chaos will appear as if it is actually coming from a human-user. This was, by far, the most technically challenging aspect of this hack. Here are a few of the changes we made:

                    Layer 3: Chaos VPN/Proxy Layer
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Chaos VPN back-end is made up of
                    <strong>
                        two cloud systems
                    </strong>
                    hosted on Linode: an OpenVPN and a server. The server deploys an Ubuntu 16.10 distro, which functions as a dynamic proxy-tester that continuously parses the Chaos Proxies to ensure performance and security standards. It then automatically removes inadequate proxies and replaces them with new ones, as well as maintaining a minimum number of proxies necessary. This ensures the Chaos Proxy database is only populated with efficient nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the OpenVPN layer is to route https traffic from the host through our VPN encryption layer and then through one of the proxies mentioned above, and finally to the destination. The VPN serves as a very safe and ethical layer that adds extra privacy for https traffic. This way, the ISP only sees traffic from the host to the VPN. Not from the VPN to the proxy, from the proxy to the destination, and all the way back. There is no connection between host and destination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward we will implement further ways of checking and gathering safe proxies. Moreover, we've begun development on a machine learning layer which will run on the server. This will help determine which sites to scramble internet history with based on general site sentiment. This will be acomplished by running natural-language processing, sentiment analysis, and entity analytics on the sites.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was
                    <strong>
                        huge
                    </strong>
                    . As we peeled back layer after layer, we realized that the tools we needed simply didn't exist or weren't adequate. This required us to spend a lot of time in several different programming languages/environments in order to build the diverse elements of the platform. We also had a few blocks in terms of architecture cohesion. We wrote the platform in 6 different languages in 5 different environments, and all of the pieces had to work together
                    <em>
                        exceedingly well
                    </em>
                    . We spent a lot of time at the data layer of the respective modules, and it slowed us down considerably at times.

                            pak
                        </strong>
                        , which allowed us to build complex build-scripts with ease. This was an early decision that helped us tremendously when dealing with
                        <code>
                            netstat
                        </code>
                        , network diagnostics and complex python/node scrape scripts.

                        We're most proud of the work we did with
                        <strong>
                            chaos.js
                        </strong>
                        . We found that
                        <strong>
                            every
                        </strong>
                        headless browser that is publicly available is easily detectable. We tried PhantomJS, Selenium, Nightmare, and Casper (just to name a few), and we could expose many of them in a matter of minutes. As such, we set out to build our own layer on top of PhantomJS in order to create the first, truly undetectable headless browser.

                    <li>
                        This was massively complex, with programming done in C++ and Javascript and nested Makefile dependencies, we found ourselves facing a giant. However, we could not afford for ISPs to be able to distinguish a pattern in the browsing data, so this technology really sits at the core of our system, alongside some other cool elements.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of code, we learned a ton about HTTP/HTTPS and the TCP/IP protocols. We also learned first how to detect "bot" traffic on a webpage and then how to manipulate WebKit behavior to expose key behaviors that mask the code behind the IP. Neither of us had ever used Linode, and standing up two instances (a proper server and a VPN server) was an interesting experience. Fitting all of the parts together was really cool and exposed us to technology stacks on the front-end, back-end, and system level.

                <p>
                    More code! We're planning on deploying this as an open-source solution, which most immediately requires a build script to handle the many disparate elements of the system. Further, we plan on continued research into the deep layers of web interaction in order to find other ways of preserving anonymity and the essence of the internet for all users!
