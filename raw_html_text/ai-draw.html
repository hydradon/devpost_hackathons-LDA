                    We wanted to build

                    first, but we ran into a lot of issues regarding neural networks, so we went ahead and found some easier applications that uses genetic evolution algorithms and stumbled across the "drawing pictures" apps we saw on

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The computer iteratively attempts to mimic an input pictures through drawing it with 100 circles of varying circle and radii, and continuously improve its accuracy based on a generic genetic algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed 3 main steps that are common in genetic algorithms:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create population of a generation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the current generation to breed a new generation. More accurately drawn individuals will be more likely to pass its traits down to its children
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Children will occasionally experience mutations, which are randomly occuring changes to their DNA properties.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In our case, the DNA would be the coordinates and colors of all our circles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The actual app itself is built with the P5 JavaScript framework, which is similar to the Processing language/environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspect was trying to optimize our fitness function, our cross-breeding function, as well as our mutation function, as the simulation takes a long time, and usually it is very difficult to get significant results in an hour. Thus, we had to be very careful in terms of when to test.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, we were not able to get a visibly optimal solution, but we believe that with further optimizations, the algorithm should be able to produce better results.
