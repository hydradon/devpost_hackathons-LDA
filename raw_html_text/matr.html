                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big part of why I attended PennApps was to learn about how to host an effective Hackathon since I will be organizing HackKean at Kean University in Spring 2017. I really wanted to make something with Hackathons in mind and this actually helps with any big events in general. It's a loss prevention system and something I definitely will be using in the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates codes that can be attached to possessions so if those possessions are lost a simple scan of the code will alert the owner via Email, and text, and if they allow it they can receive a phone call as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Java the Android Platform for the mobile app, applying XML, SMTP protocols, and handling different network provider channels. It also comes with a companion app that is built with JavaFX, CSS. The server I aimed to use was with AWS and MongoDB but that'll be in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An encryption algorithm that was secure and applicable on a standard windows app and Android App, and cloud services. Although they all adhere to AES standards there were very different libraries I would use only to find that some crucial piece was completely missing in another platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also ran into challenges making
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite feeling tired I managed to help my friend with his project and still even made a companion application. I rolled my own encryption and it works fairly well. The app is very responsive and I had some forethought with security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so much about QRcodes, I have a ton more ideas how to apply them. I also learned about encryption and encryption standards.  I learned a lot about MongoDB although It won't be in my presentation edition.
                </p>

                    What's next for Matr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the server-base to actually create special one-time codes that could be saved but that a user could assign to different possessions. Possibly hardware-special codes that alert the user when outside a certain proximity.
