                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was watching the news a while ago and a plane had gone missing somewhere over the ocean. According to reports, the GPS on the plane itself had failed. It was at that point where I had the idea of using the hundreds of GPS receivers present on the passengers smartphones to increase the possibility of being found.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app runs in the background on the passengers phone. When the app is opened and the distress button is pressed, or if the app detects a large amount of downwards movement it will activate, sending periodic location updates to a server where the data from all phones is averaged and plotted onto a map. Every phone on the plane running the app will also show the Safety Information for the aircraft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android with Java. The back-end was written in the Flask Framework using Python and was hosted on Heroku. Finally, the web front-end was built in HTML, CSS and Javascript using the Google Maps API.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Flask wouldn't communicate with the Postgres Database on Heroku because of the slight differences in data types.

                        Dates are very hard work...

                    <li>
                        We had to work out how to get the acceleration in relation to the Earth Axis using a combination of the Accelerometer and Gravity Sensor
