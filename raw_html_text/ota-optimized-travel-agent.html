                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a story we&rsquo;re all too familiar with&mdash; you&rsquo;re traveling somewhere for the first time and you want to take advantage and experience all that your destination has to offer, but you don&rsquo;t know where to begin! This is where OTA comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OTA, or Optimized Travel Assistant, is your pocket-sized travel companion. By taking in your personal tastes and preferences, along with current weather patterns and distance to location, OTA curates a customized list of nearby attractions that you'll be sure to love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our prototypal version of OTA is built with Python, HTML, and CSS and utilizes Google Cloud Platform and Google AppEngine to take in location coordinates to recommend targeted tourist attractions based on personal user input.
Our rudimentary app was built in Android Studio using Java and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a few of our first times developing an application, so we had to be quick learners and adaptable to whatever problems arose (especially figuring out how to send HTTP requests from an application).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of the fact that we have a working prototype and are extremely excited to see where the future of OTA takes us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned just how difficult it is to make a functional (and useful) application while running on little to no sleep!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OTA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of our team is fully invested and confident in the future of OTA and its ability to make an impact on consumers. Thus, we plan to bring this application to market. In order to do that, we have plans to improve our product and further enhance its abilities to personalize a user&rsquo;s travel experience. This will be accomplished by turning this web application into a fully fledged mobile app equipped with a customizable login page, the cost associated with each tourist attraction, and machine learning to become more accurate at predicting where a user will want to travel.
