                    Giphy-Trending Initially we wanted to create a web app that would display the most popular/trending giphs within certain locations: different cities, countries, etc. We decided to pick this project because giphs are extremely popular within social media and communications through social media. So figuring out how people from different areas use giphs and what's popular within certain groups of people sounded interesting. Although we did not reach the desired goal, we were on the right path, and had a good idea how to build it, but unfortunately ran out of time. We built this product using the Giphy api and flask. We used the api to search for trending giphs world wide and used flask to display it on a web-page. Challenges faced were definitely time limit, lack of knowledge in Giphy api, and flask. However, I used my time to learn about api and learned the basics of flask, which turned out easier than I thought because of the python knowledge I already had.
