                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a Passion in learning about new technologies, our group decided to learn as much as we could by creating an app using the oculus rift. We decided to work on using the oculus rift, granted it is a very new piece of technology, to truly grasp it's fundamentals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the hopes of creating an immersing experience for the player, Stacks, offers a playable game where the player must stack blocks. With scenery and music added, the player is sure to take a break from stacking to enjoy the scenes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used A-Frame, a web browser interface that was created by Mozilla. Granted this is from the web, our code consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the hardware was the first hurtle we encountered, considering none of us have ever worked with the oculus headset. After thorough research we managed to understand the hardware we were working with better to develop a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE LEARNED VR(ish) in the span of 24hrs! That is an incredibly heavy feat but completely worth it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning things on the fly is both daunting and challenging but with a lot of confidence we can get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stackz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, so much! There is still the possibility of improving the user interface so much! A lot of the stuff (text, textures, objects, events) we implemented are not the best we can do. With the restraints of 24hrs gone, we can polish up our program to look and feel absolutely stunning!
