                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the current trend of American adult obesity rates, it is estimated that by 2030 roughly half of all men and women will be obese[1].  As today's young generation, it is our mission to prevent this.  To tackle this mission we have to first understand who our demographic is and how will we connect to them.  Well first, the people that will be adults in 2030 are people like us, university students and young adults.  It is unabated that this generation of young adults are very heavily influenced by technology from using it to connect to people across the globe to posting their avocado toast and mimosa from Sunday brunch on Instagram.

                <p>
                    Through the use of mobile app development, we created an Android app that uses computer vision to understand what you are putting into your body from basic calories to a detailed breakdown of what is in those calories.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app through the use of Android Studio as well as the Google Cloud Platform to access Firebase and Google's ML Kit.
