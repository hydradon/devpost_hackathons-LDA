                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To develop a meaningful application that can motivate users to complete required physical therapy sessions that will enable them to get their mobility back and also improve quality of life.  Also a future implementation is that it can help with self-confidence by allowing users to do at home exercises to begin their fitness journey to promote a better and healthier lifestyle while being comfortable at home. This will motivate a lot of people to exercise without worrying about being made fun of or body shamed or just being nervous in general about working out at a gym.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the patient/user to connect to a physical therapist or trainer that has pre-built workouts to run through. The HoloLens renders the users home to get a sense of what they can do ability-wise in their house. It's interactive so after every exercise, it asks if they are okay and if they are in pain or not, rating system, and if they can do more or prefer something else. The program has the model do the exercises as a walkthrough/ work along with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity. Mixed Reality Tool Kit, HoloLens pipeline, Visual studio, Assets in unity: Kevin Iglesias for body model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had little to no exposure to Unity so we had to learn as we went. We were having trouble getting the model to do the motions we wanted. We would write scripts for the model to go from one point to another but nothing would happen even though the script executed without errors. The models were able to do hand motions, walk, run ( forward and back ) in place but we weren't able to get them to move from one place to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get our menu set up, and a video entrance that says " welcome to PhsX Home".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even though we didn't know much that if we work through the problems/ issues from different angles instead of giving up that we can make pieces fall together and make the program work. It's a long way away from our vision but it's a good starting point. We learned that talking about issues allows us to hear what we are saying so that during our conversations about issues we were able to think about solutions and distribute work for different aspects of the program.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn more about unity in our free time to make the program executable and functional as we planned.
