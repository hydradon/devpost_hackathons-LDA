                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visiting the Fresno State Student Cupboard sparked interest in creating a better system for such organizations to better serve the people who depend on them.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to look at a food bank's supply and also donate. Information about specific food banks can also be viewed from the app. Volunteers can subscribe to food banks to pick up donated items from donors.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use express through Node.js to host our web server. The app was written through a combination of ejs and jsx files. The database is stored on Amazon Web Services: DynamoDB and user logins are verified through Amazon Web Services: Cognito. All our files are stored within Amazon Web Services: S3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the database to the app proved to an initial challenge. Learning to sync methods through Amazon's API gateway required reading through a LOT of documentation.
                </p>
