                    This program allows users to hook up to a server that keeps track of the group and will text users if they get too far away.
It uses an android app to track user locations and sends an http request to a python server that does some analytics to return the message.
We started with an app that was going to be a remote control for a computer but ended up being scrapped for a more practical project. We tried making it work with iphone, android and a garmin smart watch but had to scrap the iphone early on and the garmin smart watch near the end. We had a difficult time sending post request to the server so we used a get request instead.
We put the python app on a digital ocean droplet and used ngrok to get the app to access the internet. I have set the url to link to the python script but it currently has not propagated. The url is project-chimera.tech and is used for backend stuff only, there is no webpage waiting for visitors.
We had to learn the following things
