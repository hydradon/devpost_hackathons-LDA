                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to organize last minute meetups with available friends depending on our schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you a list of available friends who are available. You can decide to add them to an event and ask them if they are UP for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought, at first, that android studio would be enough. However, we greatly underestimated the architectural challenges for this project. (Setting up server, real-time updates and communication for status or chats)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed a database. We went through firebase, which didn't work. We went through AWS, which crashed. Then we tried to use GCM, but it failed... as expected. We used SQLite, however, we did not have enough time to complete the integration of both the interface and the database. SQLite did not crash :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not hate each other or hit each other. We were very understanding of the circumstances. No keyboards were broken but we were mentally damaged by android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anger management and learning on the spot,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WhosUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we manage to set up the proper server to allow users to communicate with each other in real time, then we will try to make it work and become Facebook. If you are interested in financing our project, please let us know :D.
