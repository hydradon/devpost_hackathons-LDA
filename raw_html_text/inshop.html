                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    well, it happens too many times, you just visit a museum or  your friend's college and YOU ARE LOST!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    simply it lets you navigate inside the buildings, where it shows the escalators, bathrooms, and of course all the shops,  and the special is that it lets you choose a group of stores that you want to visit, and it just give you the shortest path
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we focused on a map api, so the whole thing and the maps are online into a collection of js and html files that shows the results in the android and the IOS app
                </p>
