                <p>
                    With the numbers of Internet users constantly on the rise, the need for
                    <strong>
                        know-how
                    </strong>
                    in IT security is more important than ever. This is why we'd like to spread this knowledge in a more interactive and overall fun way, so that this topic could be of greater interest to non-IT professionals (for example students or tech savvy people).

                    is a proposed solution to the aforementioned problem. Our vision is to create a teaching app that easily conveys information about IT security exploits via useful and concise information blocks. To further solidify this knowledge we have made our core function an interactive hacking game in which players use those said exploits to battle against one another.

                    What's under the hood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the project into two components: the mobile app made in Swift and a server side in Java. The backend server is a REST server managing the games of the players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we've achieved so far
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a game mode in which two hackers use SQLInjections to race one another to who can extract the most information out of a database. SQLInjections are till this day one of the most well known IT security exploits so they make a good stepping stone for our project. The players learn some basics of SQLInjections and how to use them in a context given to them. The server has a matching function which matches players who are ready to play and notifies them once a game can start.

                    What's next for Eduject
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Addition of new game modes based on other exploits. The eduject App can be improved in scalability and security in future development iterations. The tutorial can be expanded to more common software mistakes and how to avoid them. One can also think of protecting our app against replay protection in the game mode, a secure authentification and hashed IDs to increase the difficulty of the game.
