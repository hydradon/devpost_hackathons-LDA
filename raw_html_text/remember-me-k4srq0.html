                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forgetting one's family members and friends due to an ailment would make a person mentally weak. Coming to the aid of such people was the biggest motivation !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps a person with Alzheimer's remember their family members and people close to him/her by presenting memory based questions in a form of a mini web game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the user's perspective at every phase of development since the target audience does not come under the regular category. The UI had to be designed in a way which would help them use the app with ease
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this app would be useful to develop a positive environment around someone who is mentally weak
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork and new javascript frameworks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remember Me?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend on adding features which would include music and integrate Amazon Alexa that would give it a personal touch.
