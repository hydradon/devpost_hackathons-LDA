                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this was my love for dogs. As you can see, the only characters you can select are small dogs, because I believe their very feisty, and would probably be the dogs in the Dogs vs. Cats situation. Originally my team was going to do something for the great lakes project, but the game we planned to make was dropped when half of our team left.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The code that works:
                    </strong>
                    Shows a starting screen with title page on it, then a character selection and a screen for round 1.
                    <strong>
                        What the plan was:
                    </strong>
                    To make a sort of street fighter game with dogs and cats, with three different rounds. If we had time, we would've added at least some backstory but that was dropped when we knew we weren't going to finish the game.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using a series of if statements in pygame. All the graphics (except for the text), was drawn by me (Camryn), pixel by pixel. Which was probably a huge waste of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that took me 2hrs to fix was the transition from the "Round 1" screen to a black screen. I tried using clock and different arrow keys, but I eventually gave up and used a rectangle instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm probably most proud of the dog sprites, even though that is not related to coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to find a correct solution out of a variety of possibilities. Besides that I also learned a couple new things involving clocks/time in pygame, but I wasn't able to use it in my game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dogs vs. Cats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on completing this game in the near future. I would love to learn how to animate sprites and implement them into the game.
                </p>

                    Thank you!
