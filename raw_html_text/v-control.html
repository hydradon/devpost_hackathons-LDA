                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost everyone in this planet has a smartphone in the pocket, and almost everyone has played a mobile game at least once, in consequence games became part of our everyday life. Education specialist have recognized the addictiveness of games and took advantage of the technology to inspire the creation educational games, also known as serious games, which engage and motivate students in the learning process while having fun doing it. As a results student concentration was achieved and the learning outcome was impressively improved. 
These results has inspired us to take this technology to the next level and make the interaction between students and machine more engaging and human-like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a solution that will allow interacting with a game using the natural language instead of keyboard buttons, joysticks or touchscreen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we Built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first phase, we created a very simple game that interact with virtual characters using ChatBot text input. We integrated Ciscospark bot, NLP and used Unity 3D as a game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishment we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created game that interact with games using the natural language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for V-Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The second phase, we will replace the simple game with an educational game that will also track the user&rsquo;s learning outcome.
The third phase will be using speech recognition instead of text. where the Gamer/student could interact with game objects using voice only.
