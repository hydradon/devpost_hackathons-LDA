                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Inspiration was to create an android app that uses NFC to allow for an easy exchange of contact information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The premise was to connect the app to a database. have the users fill out their social media and contact information. store it on the database until request which occurs when keys are exchanged between users during NFC interaction.
