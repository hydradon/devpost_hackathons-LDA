                    We started with nothing but the heartaches of our parents and ancestors when they immigrated over. Although all of us knew somewhat that immigration was the biggest leap of faith our relatives took, some of us knew the process firsthand and desired something easier and more convenient. There was, of course, always the intense pressure that haunted us first and second generation kids, the lingering doubt of self-awareness, identity confliction, and an increasingly confused future. We knew the hardships, so we wanted to do something about it.

                    We created My Life Hacks, for those immigrants whose whole lives were based around their VISAs and passports and certifications. We found that, increasingly, many didn't know how to renew their VISAs, or understand what they needed to do in order to remain in the U.S. It was a pity, that they all, because of language or social barriers, could not get the resources that they needed.

                    My Life Hacks is a interactive map designed to make understanding everything immigrants need easier. We started with 3 East Asian countries first: China, Japan, and South Korea, to really understand what kind of data structure could best support the data. We also designed a HTML website to display a demo of what the website would be like, in it's bare bones. The goal, of course, is to improve and support the website and hopefully make it so that every immigrant can turn to our program and website for help.
