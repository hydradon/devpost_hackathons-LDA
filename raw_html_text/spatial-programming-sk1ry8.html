                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spatial programming is the beginnings of a node based programming interface, like

                    </a>
                    , but in mixed reality. The idea stemmed from a desire to learn to program while rapidly prototyping for mixed reality. The productivity potentials for a system like caught our imagination as much as the educational potentials.

                <p>
                    We're proud of our use of natural interfaces, took advantage of the affordances of the WMR interface.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what it takes to create a pseudo-programming language. We learned programming languages are very complex and to break it down spatial. It involves more than just throwing objects together.

                <p>
                    Phase One Features: finish fleshing out the library of nodes to get it closer to a full programming language.
Phase Two: add features such as:
