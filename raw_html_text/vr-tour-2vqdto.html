                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to allow people to tour a city without needing to walk around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR Tour lets users walk or fly through a city mapped by WRLD3d. Users can click buildings to display information about a building such as the address and history. Right now, VR Tour is not functional as building addresses are printed on Unity's console and not displayed on the screen for users to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mapping is powered by WRLD3d's Unity SDK (
                    <a href="https://wrld3d.com/unity/latest/docs/api/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://wrld3d.com/unity/latest/docs/api/
                    </a>
                    ). When a VR Tour user clicks the Oculus remote, the building in the center of the screen is targetted. This building's latitude and longitude is provided by WRLD3d, then sent to a google api to learn relevant information about the building.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have little to no experience with Unity, game development, and Oculus Rift. We started from scratch. It was difficult to work with Unity and Oculus Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the second hackathon for Zaid and I, and Paul's first ever. We are proud that we challenged ourselves to learn new hardware and software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is a powerful 3d game development software but it requires a lot of experience to become proficient at it.
