                    . This is the 2nd semester that we're running the course, so we had some ideas for automating the submission and grading process. Introducing

                    </code>
                    , an automatic grading framework for classes that deliver assignments through git.

                    <code>
                        git-grade
                    </code>
                    has several features to assist in collecting and grading assignments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            init
                        </code>
                        : parses a list of GitHub usernames and clones their assignment repositories to a folder. We instructed our students to simply fork our course repository and keep the same name, so we can easily clone them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            verify
                        </code>
                        : parses a config JSON file that describes a folder/file structure against which each student's repository will be tested. This is to ensure that students include the necessary files, scripts, etc as a part of their submission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            fetch
                        </code>
                        : for a previously initialized set of repositories,
                        <code>
                            fetch
                        </code>
                        will simply update each student's repository to ensure their latest work is received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>
                            deadline
                        </code>
                        : given a date and time string,
                        <code>
                            deadline
                        </code>
                        will log which repositories have commits that are beyond a deadline. These need manual intervention, or late-penalties applied accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>

                        </code>
                        : along with proper submission, homework and projects need to produce the correct results.
                        <code>
                            test
                        </code>
                        allows for each repository to be tested for code correctness and flexibility in how testing is performed.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python, since it's a language that throws the fewest syntactical bugs for my style of programming. I picked the
                    <code>
                        GitPython
                    </code>
                    module versus half-baked
                    <code>
                        os.system()
                    </code>
                    calls to develop
                    <code>
                        git-grade
                    </code>
                    more as a framework, rather than a bespoke script. The
                    <code>
                        click
                    </code>
                    module allowed for slick and easy command-line argument parsing and documentation as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        GitPython
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        click
                    </code>
                    were both libraries that I had only heard of, and had no familiarity. The toughest part was sitting down and reading enough documentation to figure out what methods and class types I needed. Once I understood the organization and philosophies of each module, it got easier to figure out what I needed to architect a feature. The only other difficulty was applying some of the algorithms and techniques I've learned onto new data structures and schemas.

                    There were a few features that came to mind as I was developing for this:

                    <li>
                        Perform more robust error checking, and try and fail safely rather than simply crash from an uncaught exception
                    </li>
