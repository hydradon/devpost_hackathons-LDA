                    As two members of our team are Europeans, we suffer a lot to find a close ATM with a convenient exchange range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we thought - why not use google maps, twilio and a simple Android app? The user enters a location, we calculate the most convenient ATMs and twilio sends you a SMS with th locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used exchange rates based on a website listing the most common UK banks and their exchange rates. With the google-places API we search for ATMs.

                    Android apps are very complex. We tried to keep it as simple as possible since we only need an insert box and a output tab. How to get data from the app to the node.js program and back?!
                </p>

                    Android-Studio, Node.js is painful
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to link all the components together and include more banks (right now 9).
