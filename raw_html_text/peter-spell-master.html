                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our past experience of playing simple yet intuitive web games. Furthermore, we were also inspired by being able to create a game that can be useful and beneficial to children&rsquo;s ability to learn new vocabulary words through a game. We wanted to create something that would be addicting, yet educational at the same time.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Peter Spell Master is a straightforward game that challenges the player to type words before Peter the Anteater and his castle are attacked by the invaders. The game is aimed towards children with the purpose of helping them learn new vocabulary words. However, the game can easily be modified to any sort of subject with a question answer format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build this aesthetic but fun game, we used a couple of programs and programming languages such as Python, Pygame, Adobe Illustrator, etc&hellip; Furthermore, we enforced a modular design, encouraging high cohesion and low coupling. Communication was another one of the key tools that we utilized in order to complete the project on time and be able to stay up to date on what each person on the team was working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being unfamiliar with GitHub, we ran into many challenges updating our repositories to keep our code up-to-date with one another. We had to rewrite a good portion of our code because we did not understand how to correctly merge. Each time a teammate pushed their version of code, it caused conflicts that we had to fix on the spot. We also had an issue with time. Our original plan was a little too complicated for the amount of time that we had. Because of this time constraint, we had to remove some features that we would have liked to have from the beginning. Towards the end of the hackathon, we had to prioritize which features that we felt would be most important to the experience of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The setting and environment allowed us to work together as a strong team. We enjoyed designing a game that is both educational, and coextensive. Overall, we learned how to work as a team, work under pressure, and work for the purpose of wanting to help and educate others through a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that clear communication and a concise design philosophy can make or break a project. What really helped was having someone who was able to direct the team and divide the workload. With everyone working on separate areas of code, there was a lot of progress made in a small amount of time. Even with the merging conflicts, we felt that our divided labor was able to help keep each separate component organized at the end of the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peter Spell Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peter Spell Master is currently a spelling game, but with time, it can be molded into something different. In order to have Peter Spell Master grow, we plan on implementing different subjects such as math, science, and history.
