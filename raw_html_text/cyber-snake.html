                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a creative HoloLens experience that truly transformed your space and motivated the user to interact in fun, innovative (and silly!) ways. Re-imagining simple classics seemed like a good place to start, and our redesign of Snake turned out to be more engaging than it had any right to be (:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon starting the game, the user is prompted to scan their space. Using the Hololens's Spatial Mapping sensors and some scripts that we wrote, we were able to get a full understanding of the user's space and automatically create a custom play area specific to your surroundings by analyzing the normals of the spatial mesh with raycasts and calculating which areas of the room find themselves empty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After scanning and generating the playspace, the user can play the game. Users must use their head to collect CyberCubes&trade; while at the same time avoiding the ever-growing CyberTail&trade; that follows them. Other special pickups are also available, like the CyberMotivationalVortex&trade;, which attracts all of the surrounding cubes into a single point in space if you say a motivational quote (and explodes, transforming the colors of the space completely), and the CyberGravityPull&trade;, which can help you get out of sticky situations by dropping all of the CyberTail&trade; spheres on the ground for a few seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game also has a number of easter eggs and voice commands that can be used to enhance your CyberExperience&trade;. Try saying "Samuel Jackson", for instance. Bonus points for whoever discovers the others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, Hololens, C#, coding, caffeine, sheer will.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discovering meaningful interactions for the HoloLens is always a challenge given its limited input. Because the documentation on HoloLens development (specially with things like SpatialMapping) is so limited, we also had to develop a lot of our own technology to get the desired final result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks polished and it's very fun to play - we also got to design a lot of our own sound effects, assets, easter eggs and interactions. The gameplay loop is simple but has depth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mixed Reality is TheFuture&trade;, a bunch of Unity and HoloLens development tricks, sound design discoveries and also what are the things that make a HoloLens interaction fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cyber Snake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More polish, create a story-mode and post it in the Microsoft Store for others to enjoy.
