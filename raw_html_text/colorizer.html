                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to help the elderly by bringing back memories they had from earlier and help those memories be more relatable. So I decided to add color to their black and white images they had from their childhood. This adds life to pictures taken before colored photos were invented and helps better understand their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project takes in a black and white image as input and predicts what the colored image should look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this in python and used tensorflow. I chose to use convolutional neural networks. I also used only a few colored images for training data to predict my testing image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into were finding out how to set design the layers of the CNNs and other parameters as well such as epochs. Another huge challenge was trying to find a good balance between creating a successful predicted image and the amount of time it took to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of learning tensorflow and CNNs and to create a working colorizer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned tensorflow and CNNs.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Colorizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will like to colorize black and white movies. So then the old movies that are in black and white can be brought to life.
