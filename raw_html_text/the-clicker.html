                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add a better way of communicating morse code to everyone. Using the visual and audio to the person to read the morse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You interact with one rpi to sent the message other. The other rpi is fitted with led and  a buzzer to produce the give sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built with a very simple array of lights and buzzer and two RPI 3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a communication problem that we used sockets to work around. The rpi did not connect to the devices
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <strong>
                        It works
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket communication  and python allowing me to use the RPI to its full potential
                </p>
