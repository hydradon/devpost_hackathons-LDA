                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many websites hosts data for lost animals but there is currently few service that provides a central robust database for stray animals and pets. Existing websites and databases do not also include geographical data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It help users take an image, tag the image as being that of a stray or lost animal and include other info like if its hurt or neutered or not. We also pull data from existing fragmented data sources and display them in a user friendly way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have three components: an Android application for the client side, Python backend and web app for viewing the combined data in a beautiful interface. We used phone geo data and image similarity to figure out whether if 2 different images are of the same dog
