                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is estimated that 415 million people are living with diabetes, and this number is unfortunately expected to rise to 642 million by 2040.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to greater awareness and better treatments, many who have been diagnosed with the disease are living longer, healthier lives. However diabetes requires changes and considerations that permeate throughout every aspect of life. It&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed and isolated on the path to self-management, especially for people who are newly diagnosed.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;What can I eat? How much exercise should I get?&rdquo;, many questions that people with diabetes ask themselves everyday. But it is not possible for them to ask their endocrinologist or diabetes educator these questions everyday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oris is a personal voice-enabled assistant that can be like having an educator in your home. It helps you to maintain a stable glucose level by keeping track of your insulin and glucose levels. It reminds you when you should take your insulin dose and recommends you food according to your preferences and current glucose level. In addition it assists you on choosing physical activities that will help you to have a better life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Someone newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes might not know where to start in researching and managing the disease, being able to ask Oris basic questions will help get people on the right track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine if a person asks Oris if it would be OK to eat some potato chips. Oris will be able to calculate the effect this could have on his or her blood sugar, and propose alternative food as well.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Oris with Amazon Alexa, which is becoming a familiar presence in homes. More than a device, Alexa is a partner to make navigating daily life easier. Voice enabled apps allow an easier and more natural interaction, also they are easier to use for people who are not familiar with smartphones and computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to design and decide which features can be useful for diabetes patients, also we faced some technical issues when connecting the Alexa skill to the database.
