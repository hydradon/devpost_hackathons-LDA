                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A team member's partner has type 1 diabetes and also has a good friend who was recently diagnosed with type 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    25 million Americans have diabetes and 1.25 million more are diagnosed each year.
Diabetes is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States and this is primarily related to diabetics not regulating their blood sugars. The rising cost of insulin is a huge factor, which we aim to help alleviate for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the cost of insulin is not fixed in any way, but insurance providers have pricing tiers: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Knowing which tier a certain insulin is categorized in for competing insurance providers and/or the different plans each provider offers, would give patients the ability to advocate for themselves better AND allows patients to select the plan that would help them the most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides the user with up to date price tiers for each of their medications (insulin, insulin delivery methods, and pills for regulating blood sugar) for the main insurance providers and their pricing tiers/plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is valuable because this is information that is not online anywhere and is currently updated twice a plan year. To get this information, a patient has to call their insurance provider and ask OR wait for their bill. Both options are not ideal. Calling the insurance provider means having to talk to robots and live humans who may or may not have the accurate information. It is a very frustrating process to find information that, at the end, you still aren't sure if it is accurate. Waiting for the bill means you have little recourse to fight the charges.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS and JQUERY for the front end. 
We used MYSQL and PHP for the dabase/backend. 
Images were created and/or edited in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to be careful not to violate HIPAA, even though this is not an official medical record. Work was done to keep the data anonymous and not associated with an email address, until the user selected that they were okay with it. 
We aspired to be able to send the customized results via email, but we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing, by the deadline, a functioning website that delivers results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was everyone's first, complete hackathon. We learned how to put various things together into a product we had envisioned. Everyone also learned a lot more about diabetes than we previously knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Diabetes Insurance Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to call all major insurance providers to get the accurate data we need for the backend database. This will need to be done twice a year. While it may seem like a lot of work, publishing the results in our database means that millions of Americans no longer have to do it. They can just check our website!
Currently, what we have in our backend database is only an example of how three major health insurance providers MIGHT classify certain types of medications for diabetics, but it is not accurate - it's only to demonstrate what the final product will look like. It also does currently not get into the great detail of every medication that diabetics need. That will also come in a later revision.
