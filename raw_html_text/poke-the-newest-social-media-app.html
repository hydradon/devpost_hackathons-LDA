                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an app that we could let our girlfriends' know that we were thinking about them and it took off from there. Since then, we've worked to try to create an easy to use platform in which we can "Poke" our girlfriend and let them know we want attention
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Pokes" another person to let them know that your either want their attention or are just thinking about them.

                    I learned a lot about Photoshop and how to work with the CSS and git repositories.

                <p>
                    We wanted an app that we could let our girlfriends' know that we were thinking about them and it took off from there. Since then, we've worked to try to create an easy to use platform in which we can "Poke" our girlfriend and let them know we want attention. This idea was broadened so that families and friends could use as well.
