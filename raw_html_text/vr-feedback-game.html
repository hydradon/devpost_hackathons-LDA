                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game for the Force VR Gauntlet, a device that I made at a previous hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game demo demonstrating the Force VR Gauntlet capabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first had to sync the Force VR with Unity, which took half the hackathon to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Force VR Gauntlet to work with Unity as well as dealing with the Kinect
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to deal with Unity, never underestimate the difficulity of downloading a package, and a little bit of hardware
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Feedback Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going to try to create a better VR Feedback game at the next hackathon!
