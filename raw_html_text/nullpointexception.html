                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just like how we were inspired to develop a VR program, we want to inspire the next generation to enjoy making and developing their own products. We figured that cars would be a simple yet fun way to inspire them as by making cars, you understand the design principles behind it and they can also experience and use their own creation instead of just building it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two segments to our game. The building segment and the driving segment. During the building segment, the user is able to choose different kinds of chassis and tires to build their desired car. Once they build the car, they will then drive the car and experience the different driving experience when you utilize different components to build a car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We segmented our jobs into functions and aesthetics. Two of us were responsible for how the game works, what we envision in the game and how the object interacts, while the other two of us were in charge of settling the controls and building the aesthetics such as the garage environment for the users to interact in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into an extremely huge obstacle which was the API for the configuration of the VR controls had a huge change and was extremely different from how people usually did it. Given that it was our first time utilizing it, we spent a significant amount of time to attempt to calibrate and utilize the VR controls. It is unfortunate that we were unable to resolve this issue till the very end .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set a goal for ourselves during the 2 day hackathon and that was to learn and experience the process of VR development. We were proud that we persevered through the night, attempting to solve the many issues that we encountered along the way. Even though we did not create a fully working prototype that we envisioned, we still enjoyed this learning process and we gained a huge amount of experience from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going through it, we realized the difficulties of VR development as well as the joy in it as we saw our creations come to fruition bit by bit. We also learned to accept that there may be times where we did our very best but we still may not achieved the initial goal we set out for. Even though we were frustrated and upset that we are unable to complete a full working prototype, we were glad we went through this experience and we know that this experience will strengthen us for our next hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NullPointException
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To stop becoming an error and start to produce working prototypes during hackathons that we can be proud of. We also will not give up on working with VR and hopefully one day we will be able to participate in another one again!
