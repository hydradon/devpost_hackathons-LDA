                    I wanted to make a project that isn't just something that I submit to Mhacks and then forget about. I wanted to make something that I would use afterwards and also using some platform I have never used before. One of my friends in a previous hackathon submitted a chrome extension that got me thinking about how often I use google chrome and that here are a few quality of life extensions that I would want.

                    What KnowMe does it track the sites that a user goes on AND tracks how long the person is actively on the site (moving the mouse, scrolling through a page) so that instead of just being able to tell me the websites that someone goes on he most, it can prioritize sites that are used the most. I am still working on implementing the list of urls into a small menu that opens up containing the list. Another thought that I had was making it so that it creates its own folder in chrome bookmarks to be perused by the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with the chrome API and making an extension were both new to me and at first, I struggled learning how to use the folder system and the manifest correctly. What's next for KnowMe is to refine the algorithm and to make it so that the ordered urls are more readily available (maybe automatically opened as a new tab when chrome is started up)
