                    Let It Out allows users to randomly match with someone that has a similar topic.
They can then rant to them anonymously and get whats bothering them off their chest.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    after building the site we looked at the searching, we accomplish the searching with semantic relationships . this was handled in python. this was never actually implemented due to the python script not being transplanted properly . the chat feature wasn't implemented due to lack of infrastructure
                </p>

                <p>
                    The python script was not transplanted properly and my version of python was bad.
