                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make work orders and parks services workflow easier for everyone in the City of San Jose

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile application allows both residents and city staff members to report, view, and edit hazards/maintenance request tickets in parks immediately when the see them. They will also be able to view all tickets submitted and subscribe to them. Staff members/contractors will be notified when a ticket pertaining to their park district is assigned.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing a scalable database: designing schemas that are inexpensive to scale when number of users grow, using indexing strategies to optimize lookup latency
                </p>
                <p>
                    Configuring Heroku

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application prototype, a MVP (React Native frontend), and also were able to design and construct schemas for easier implementability of future features and scalability of the application.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with each other, put checks and balances on ideas but also respect them. We should have been more proactive in asking for help from our mentors.
