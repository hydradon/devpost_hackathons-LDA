                    React Native application that connects college students wishing to buy and sell their extra meal swipes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that solved the problem of Freshman at Georgia Tech, and other colleges, being forced to have maxed out meal plans and no way to use them up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app uses Geolocation to confirm buyer/seller's location, provides specific information on dining halls and campus restaurants, and allows sellers to link up with buyers to exchange a meal swipe for a discounted price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using React Native we were able to write once and deploy to both Android and iOS! We focused on modularizing our code, streamlining load times and taking a user-focused approach.
