                    Dionysus is the god of madness, wine, intoxication, revelry, and partying. We emulate the model of Dionysus with our incredible combinations and pairings of drinks, music, and even some activities to go along with your meal :)

                </h2>
                <p>
                    VeryHungry will go around the world twice for our customers. We will take in your meal information, and from that access a multitude of databases. Once the food has been entered, we have a proprietary method for generating a set of data that will then be sent to the user. Thus, we will then recommend to the User a specific pairing of a song (we list the name and artist and also include a short snippet of the music), a drink (alcoholic and non are alcoholic) including how to make the drink and ingredients, and a possible fun activity that you may enjoy doing while enjoying your meal or after your meal :).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, we have it set to fun mode. In fun mode we have HUGE library of potential drinks, songs, and activities, and they will be selected at
                    <strong>
                        random
                    </strong>
                    for your meal. It is a really fun game to play where you never know what crazy, fun, and interesting combo of drinks, activities, and songs you could be given for your meal (almost like a roulette for your meals).

                    we used openly available APIs, such as CocktailDB and iTunes, to access enormous databases for music, moods, food, drinks, recipes, nutrition, ingredients, and pairings. With some help from google, we also manually came up with an enormous list of activities that could go well with a meal. We made use of this data to make our own REST API backend in Flask, that we then hosted on Heroku and connected with the front-end after enabling CORS.

                    We learned a lot about the interconnection between emotions, music, food, and fun and how to represent these interconnections using algorithms in our website in order to yield the best and most enjoyable user experience.

                    We also learned a lot about using API's including using Postman
