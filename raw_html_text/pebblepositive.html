                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pebble Time app was built using Pebble.js in the CloudPebble development environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble.js is still in beta and there is very little document on the framework. There is significantly less functionality available through Pebble.js compared to Pebble C, which as proven to be a extremely difficult to work around. There were also connectivity issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Accelerometer functionality created a better user experience and allowed for the detection of the human being's behaviour.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt the ins and outs of Pebble.js and the nuances that goes with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pebble Positive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble Positive is not just intended to be an app, but a framework to build upon a positive lifestyle. Smartstraps can be included to create a more accurate reading of the human being's mental state. With those features set, the possibility of gamification of different aspects of life can create better user response and conditioning.
