                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make shopping easier! It may be hard to find the best deals and which stores nearby carry the items you need with all stores in one place. ShopBest makes it easier to find the best place to go shopping for all your needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile application that lets you input your shopping list. With a click of a button, find the total cost in the stores nearby that carry all your shopping needs. This takes into account various discounts that stores may be running, and helps you plan your shopping list travel path to take the least amount of time with the best price.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mobile application utilizing Android Studio in JAVA. We utilized hash maps to keep track of your items and quantity and compared them to hash maps that hold the inventory and prices of various stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One complication is that we started with using React and trying to learn JavaScript; however, we found that by leveraging our knowledge of JAVA, we were able to better utilize Android Studios, so we changed our development tool.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a smooth and functional interface for the mobile application, with various features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a mobile application using Android Studio, learning how to create and use different widgets, features, and data structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShopBest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to connect this with GPS features to find the stores with a certain radius, and we would like to utilize this for outside of grocery items.
