                    This is an Inter-agency deconfliction application that creates a simple, secure, yet profoundly effective centralized deconfliction portal for distributing counter-poaching efforts. This web application allows users to submit a location and topic that they will be focusing on in an upcoming operation. If another user submits info about an operation that matches an existing one, they will receive a notice to contact the first user so that they can either share their information or prevent interfering with each other's efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus of this application is security. User accounts are managed by the program administrator so that only authorized agents are able to log in. When a match is found with two operations, only the bare minimum data is sent back to the user: the contact info for the first user, no information about their operation. Once the operation has finished (determined by a date given by the user), all records of the operation are removed from the database so that historical records cannot be used by nefarious parties or rogue users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application also has language support, allowing users from different countries to be able to use the application more easily.
