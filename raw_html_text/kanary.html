                <p>
                    Just as canaries would alert coal miners of dangerous environmental conditions the Kanary extension will alert users of dangerous privacy conditions.

                    As more companies are profiting from selling user data, it is more important than ever that they know what is happening to their information. The average American is expected to read and agree to approximately 1500 privacy policies a year which is a confusing and time-consuming process (UT Austin Center for Identity). We wanted to make a tool that increases user awareness by finding the most concerning terms in any privacy policy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kanary is a Chrome extension that searches any privacy policy webpage for concerning language we have preset - like "third-parties" - and shows the user the full context of those terms in the policy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end is a combination of html, javascript, and css. The back end uses R and a Shiny server to parse through the policy.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to get the R part of our code to communicate with the front end GUI.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully analyzing the privacy policies of Apple and Facebook.

                    What's next for Kanary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This extension could be used to text mine ANY webpage for both preset and users' custom keywords.
