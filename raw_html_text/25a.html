Schools will be accountable to provide the 10% quota for disadvantaged children.
Verifiable mechanism to ensure compliance.
Up to 1 million children can potentially gain absolutely free, quality education.
 Government buy-in will be easier to ensure as the solution is based on a Law.

                    Initial Phase/Pilot in Islamabad:
 Volunteer Basis Launch 
 Seed Money/Donor to launch Proof of Concept
Medium Term:
 Tax breaks = Private Schools will be happy to contribute a small amount annually to a system that helps them get the best students in their quotas and also verifies their compliance with the law.
Long Term:
As a law enforcement tool, the Federal and Provincial Governments can take over the project
