                    First of all, we got experience  of real working with Babylon.js and now we can use it like Web Engine to build VR application. Secondly we've deeper learned how to build Web Application based on ASP.Net Core 2.0. We have got deep knowledge  about how to code multiplayer in modern games and tried to realize it in our application.
 ## What's next for SCVR
Our next step's realize Voice Chat, File Server UI, Video and Image Viewer for people coloboration
