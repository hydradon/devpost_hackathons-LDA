                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The U of R Robotics Club had a glove with bend sensors attached to it. We decided to fix the glove and create software to have the glove interact with a computer.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The glove is able to recognize if a finger is bent or not. We are able to read this information with a Python program and output global keystrokes. We created a game to go along with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the glove with bend sensors. First, we used the analog sensors on the Arduino to read the voltage inputs on the bend sensors and determine whether a finger was bent and write to the serial. Then we wrote a Python program to read the serial and interpret the input into global keystrokes. From there, we could interact with various other programs of our choice.

                    We're thinking that this technology could be useful for interaction with various technologies, like smart phones, etc.
