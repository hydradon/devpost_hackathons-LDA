                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help BMCC students find food options near the college area.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa helps to search for food options near the BMCC area.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Alexa Lambda function using javascript and prompted it to give food truck options around the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge that we ran into while building the lambda function was the random function that we would use to separate a variable that we created with all the food trucks along with their addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tested the program and it works as we planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to build Alexa skills with Lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BMCC Food Options
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for the application we built is to include more food options along with the discounts that are available to BMCC students, hence why we named the invocation name BMCC Food Options. After we will accomplish this, we were thinking of expanding this skill to the residential area. Then, we would tell Alexa what ingredients that we have available to us and then Alexa would tell us what we could cook with those ingredients.
