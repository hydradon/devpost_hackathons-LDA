                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually only the rich with big portfolios had the capability to manipulate penny stocks by pumping and dumping them. That's not fair, so we created PumprDumpr
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone can organize a pump and dump for a specific stock, ad raise money from others. People sign in with their brokerage account, and our program buys it all at once, waits for the stock to go up, then sells it all at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app is built on node.js with the pug view engine. It is hosted on Microsoft Azure on a .tech domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we deployed our app on Azure, for some reason it was giving an internal server error even though it was working locally. Turns out our startscript used nodemon instead of node and it didn't have nodemon installed. One of us wasted half the hackathon working on this bug :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of our own fuzzy search that will filter out stocks that you don't want. Another thing is converting a huuuge CSV file to JSON so we could find elements and iterate through it extremely easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of different skills that we could use at every next hackathon, such as setting up Microsoft Azure, learning OAuth, essentially creating our own API that we could use to get stocks, among many other smaller skills..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PumprDumpr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that PumprDumpr could revolutionize the penny stock industry, and helping companies by increasing their stock prices.
