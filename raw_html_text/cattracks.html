                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many neighborhoods, there are feral cat colonies and domestic outdoor cats. This website was created with the idea that it would be helpful for owners and TNR(Trap-Neuter/Spay-Return) programs to keep track of the cats they are involved with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site has a home page, forum page, and a button to input information on cats in the area. The home page on our site has a map, which keeps track of data of cats in an area by placing dots as to where they have been, images of these cats, and a description box. The forum page is to enable cat owners, shelters, and virtually anyone involved with cats to post about missing cats, finding a TNR program to aid with feral colonies that are not neutered or spayed, conversation about adoption or purchasing of cats, and pretty much anything related to the maintenance of cats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website like any other website -- python to operate what is occurring behind the frontend of the program (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three members of our group had no prior experience to creating websites, and we also ran into issues with compiling resources together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a working website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the group learned HTML and gained more experience with python. There was also the joys of learning about TNR.
