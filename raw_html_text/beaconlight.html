                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming ideas for this HackUPC Edition until we came up with this AR game idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using different markers, we instantiate a scene and multiple mirrors. A laser tower is firing a light beam that you must redirect using the mirrors so that it impacts into a magic crystal to power it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity3D and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without a printer, it was difficult to get some markers that could do the work. Creating a refractive laser beam was quite a challenge too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in using AR to create our own game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Positioning in augmented reality can be quite hard sometimes, and accuracy can be low.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for beaconLight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It requires some more work to finish the required functionalities to make it available to users.
                </p>
