                    We all see headlines, news articles, friend's tweets, instagrams and facebook comments about virtually any company/industry in the world. We are curious to see how all these sentiments/output influences market value and stock prices on a day to day basis.

                    It was difficult to actually use the engagament scores because these were only applicable if a post had been released that day, for dates when the company did not post, the score would be 0, which was a bit meaningless in terms of what we were looking for.

                    We want to try out different measure metrics from other social media databases and also expand to different industries and see how effective our model is there.
