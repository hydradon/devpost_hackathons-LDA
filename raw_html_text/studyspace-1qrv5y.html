                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our high school journeys, we often found it difficult trying to explain to one another confusing math and physics problems via text or phone call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, it would allow users to view the same whiteboard page at the same time if they have the code. They would be able to draw on the whiteboard and see one another's changes in real time. As of now, the collaboration feature is not working and only one user can use the website at a time, but that is our plan for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally attempted to build it as an android app on Android Studio. However, we eventually changed it to a website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to create three separate projects, eventually coming back to this one, our first idea. This project was a challenge because two of our group members had never coded in HTML or CSS or JavaScript before. We have not yet overcome the challenge of allowing the collaboration feature using Heroku, but we hope to do so in the future.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to allow users to draw online, that we were able to create our own domain, and that we could link all the pages on the website.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the HTML/CSS and JavaScript coding languages, as well as how to create a website.

                    What's next for StudySpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for StudySpace is figuring out how to allow multiple users to use a whiteboard at once and collaborate with one another.
