                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you being extremely lazy and you don't feel like operating your apps using any sort of keyboard or mouse or touch? We got you covered! We can control the apps using gestures recognized by your smartwatch!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It controls your apps using gestures given by your smartwatch. You can control websites and apps such as tinder, music player, snake game and so on....possibilities are unlimited!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to generate data from your wearable device which will be consumed by your application. As a pilot app, we have a music player which would recognize next song, previous song, play song and pause song using gestures recognized by your watch. The watch and your apps are connected via a socket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calibrating the sensors to give expected output was the biggest task we faced and we are glad that it worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could now shower and control the music player at the same time :P
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the easiest of problems might take as long as 10 hours to fix where patience and determination is something which will keep you going!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Motion Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it as generic and as possible and replacing traditional game controller with smartwatch!
