                    EZtrack is a device that automatically keeps track of your blood sugar and sends the results to your phone. It gives suggestions on how you should deal with your sugar level. It will remind you throughout the day on when you should check your sugar level or estimate where it should be. Below is a demo of the app where you plug in your sugar level and the app tells you how to approach it.
