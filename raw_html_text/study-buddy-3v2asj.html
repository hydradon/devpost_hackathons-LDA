                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    University life is hard. There is a prevalence of distress over time management, grades, and people are overall not internally motivated to learn. Our overall goal is to inspire learning by placing emphasis on the process of study and not the destination of a grade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It first asks for a goal of the study session and samples your mood. It displays a simple Pomodoro timer with some prompts for self-care during the 5-minute break. There is a walkthrough of each prompt, then asks if the timer should be reset or the study session should end. After the session, the user is asked if they met their goal and samples their mood again. These data are stored as statistics for the user to see progress over time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a website platform with python, javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon, and we had limited knowledge of coding. We had a very slow start in getting the code written.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates, who had no experience in coding for a website, was able to create a page with the timer and self-care prompts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned the backbone of a website and what it takes to develop a website by manual code.
                </p>

                    What's next for Study Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to track user progress (mood, goal completion). We did not have enough time to figure out that approach.
