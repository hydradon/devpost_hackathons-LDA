                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make the head-tie frame on behave of those who love Head-tie But don&rsquo;t have access to it in reality,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are varies of head-tie which user can choose the color and styles of head -tie they want and take a nice picture or video with it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the head-tie from Google image and it was edited with photoshop and Corel draw then we make use of the face-tracer section on our Spark Ar to find the face and we use the plane to position the head-tie to the position where it fit in to the head
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges when we are trying to make the UI button that is used to switch and pick the type of head-tie the user want to take a picture with and also after we finished the project we tested it on our mobile spark At player and we found out that the button are sticking to the picture after we click the caption button,so we have to go extra mile to find solution to that which took us a bit time to get that fixed
                </p>
