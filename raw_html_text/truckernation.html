                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The trucking industry is a fragmented industry with centralization. Eighty percent of truck drivers are independent contractors but utilize major, centralized third-party logistics providers to find freight for them to haul. Centralized brokers are more concerned with securing a truck for their customers including of providing accurate information about the conditions of the location (ex. weather storms, lack of docks so need physical labor to help unload the freight, lack of parking) and other requirements for the load (ex. need to stop for a government-issued permit that is load-specific) until issues arise that prevent delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, truck drivers who do long-hauls must travel all across the country to cities where they are unfamiliar with truck services and have no support system.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform where a decentralized group of truck drivers can input and verify location data of truck services and "reviews" of weather and shipper/manufacturer friendliness and requirements for specific locations.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Algorand blockchain because I was intrigued by its pure proof of stake concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first blockchain application so at first, I did not know how to start a node, deploy the app, and also integrate different blockchains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created my first blockchain application.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use an API to create a remote node and create wallets on the Alogrand blockchain.
                </p>
