                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, as a team, were inspired, in big part, by the, dare I say, popular ridesharing app, Uber. Although automobiles make up a majority of the average person's modes of daily transportation, we believe that there is still a demand in the market for alternative transportation services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moober connects the user with local, grass-fed cows for transportation services. We believe that surprise is the essence of life, so our app integrates that element of surprise into your daily commute by dropping you off at an entirely random location. We hope that our product will be able to deliver an incredibly enriching bovine experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is developed in Android Studio using Java and XML. We use Google Maps Web Services to calculate routes for the cows to take and to locate local cows. For this preliminary product, we have partnered with local wild cows in the eucalyptus forests of La Jolla. We see this as an opportunity for our users to have an impact on the local cow community at the grassroots level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was the implementation of animated widgets on the app interface. We struggled for an excessively long time with MotionLayouts before realizing that the library was only in its beta phase. We suspect that its early development phase is an indication of its unreliability, hence why its implementation broke our interface. Another challenge we encountered was attempting to pitch our idea to local cows. Due to our lack of foresight, we had not hired English-Bovine translators ahead of time; this made our negotiation meetings rather difficult and frustrating until we could find someone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, this is our first experience with Android app development, and we are greatly satisfied with how the product turned out and how much we learned over the course of this hackathon. We are proud to deliver Moober to the market, and we believe that this is a revolutionary and groundbreaking product that will absolutely change the way we get around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to use Android Studio and we definitely see ourselves applying this experience in the future towards personal projects, internships, and our future careers. We also connected with many cow communities in the Great San Diego area, and learned so much about bovine society and culture, and we cannot wait for you to have that experience when you use Moober.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moober
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to continue scaling and expanding beyond the La Jolla cow community and reach cows all along the West Coast, across the United States, and around the world. We hope to bring together an international community of cows and empower them to take control of their own careers within their comfort zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond Moober, we are also looking to expand even further into the ridesharing industry. Currently, we are negotiating with Italian investors on a gondola-sharing app, which we plan to first launch in Venice in the near future. We are also planning to the skies soon with MooAir, a fully cow-run airplane-sharing service. Even more exciting, we will already have launched the world's first time-travel-sharing service, which will have already dominated the market. We hope that you are just as excited as we are, and will continue supporting our future business ventures.
