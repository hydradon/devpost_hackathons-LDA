                    In the US, around
                    <strong>
                        40%
                    </strong>
                    of food is thrown away by the average American household. When you consider the resources necessary to produce this sheer amount of food, it is apparent how important it is not to waste it. It is our responsibility as consumers to make sure we are being sustainable. Therefore, we wanted to help other consumers lower their food waste by keeping track of their fridge and pantry content.
                    <em>
                        We have devised a web app that would help users to keep track of the food they have in their pantry and when it might expire.
                    </em>
                    Our website would even suggest new recipes for users to cook with this food. 
We have created a rudimentary website on a .tech domain that informs users of the dangers of food waste and takes an input of food in a user&rsquo;s pantry and suggest recipes for them to make.
We worked out of a html front-end in WebStorm and a Python back-end in PyCharm and hosted our html in Google Cloud for storage and redirected to .tech for UI.
We ran into difficulties when developing a back-end for the storage of user data but were unable to implement it due to a set of API difficulties. However, we managed to create an easy-to-use User Interface that can keep track of bought food. We also made a generator for recipes with items that were in the food storage
Aside from the dangers of Food Waste, we learned a lot about making websites in HTML and designing them CSS. Additionally, we learned how to control HTML websites with JavaScript.
If we would have had more time, we would complete our data storing and users back-end and expand upon our recipes database. We could also include more focused application of our system for specific cases. Lastly, we would add more food items and a bigger database for possible recipes.
