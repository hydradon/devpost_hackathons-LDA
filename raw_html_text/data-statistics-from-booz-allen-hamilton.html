                    After meeting the members of Booz Allen Hamilton and learning of the prizes that they were offering we really wanted to create something so amazing that we could win one of their 3d printers. One of the first data sets that they had on their site was on crime statistics by year and purchase lists by government department in DC. We believed that we could come up with an interesting way to show the data in a meaningful way and hopefully spark meaningful conversations about crime and police spending. This is primarily due to all of the recent media coverage of police brutality towards civilians.
