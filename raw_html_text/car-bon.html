                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the public more aware of how much carbon they create when they traveled. However, we also wanted to make sure that we made it as simple and straightforward as possible for the user.
                </p>

                    Usage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can text a number "car start now" when you are starting a trip, and "car stop now" at the end of a trip. From this, the app will use the timecodes at which the texts were sent and the model of your car to figure out how much CO2 your trip produced. You can then view all your history and some comparisons on a dashboard with clean and simplistic visuals.
