                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in a world filled with neural disorders and other brain related diseases we realized that everyone should be able to learn more about the human mind, and so Brain Space VR was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It acts as a gateway for both the average joe and a professional medical expert to view the human brain and personal/patient EEG simultaneously in a fully immersive 3-D environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to build the 3-D interactive environment for both the Oculus and the Myo Armband. We used python to create a web scraper to gather data on the respective brain parts. We built our website using JavaScript and we also used the Muse Data Lab to record the EEG.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breaking up the brain into its respective parts in the 3-D model. Creating the web scraper and running it on Python - a new language for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the trio of revolutionary hardware to build something useful and unique.
