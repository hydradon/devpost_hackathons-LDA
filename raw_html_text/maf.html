                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of saving students time on their math homework and the minimizing the use of painful browser extensions to manually input equations. Writing an equation on paper and scanning it would potentially save time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizes handwriting, especially math symbols and equations and converts them into LaTex, which can then be converted into text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first used HTML and CSS to build the skeleton of the website and then used JSP to host a local server. We then used java to read a picture from the user and use the MathPix API to recognize the handwriting equations in the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first experience working with APIs. It took a long time to figure out how to properly integrate it with the website. We also faced a few problems using Apache Tomcat that we later figured out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a working project and the successful collaboration of our team.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use APIs, how to use GIT, how to work with servers, and machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Maf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on developing it further for it to reach all its features. We plan on converting the LaTex into text and outputting it in a presentable manner that students can possibly copy and paste into their homework, saving them time.
