                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a sea slug that looks like a rabbit on the internet and gave us the inspiration to form "bunnysnail".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that holds three different games we created using Construct 3. Every game was made by very different people, but are all coming together to support similar causes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Construct 3.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None. Learning Construct 3 and FTP.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Athena got her sprite to stop flopping on the ground and have a proper walking animation. Tuzette implementing the wall collision logic for her bunny massacre. Sarah counted all 123 tiles that make up the image.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that we did here at the hackathon was solely based on things we learned during the hackathon. No previous experience influenced our ability to complete our projects.
