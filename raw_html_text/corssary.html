                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While searching for community college courses to take over winter intersession, I spent about 40 minutes sifting through articulation agreement pdfs looking for any colleges in the state that offered a course that would fulfill a specific lower-division major requirement. After all that searching, only one school had a transferrable course; however, that did not matter as it could be taken online meaning my distance from the college was irrelevant. At that time, I realized there are likely hundreds of these niche articulated courses that students are missing out on due to a lack of knowledge. The dated system of PDF articulation agreements is counterintuitive to an enriching collegiate education. As such, this seeks to offer students the most educational opportunities that they desire to pursue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to select which California Public University that they attend and allows them to search for their school's course requirements. The application then returns the community colleges in state that offer a course that is listed in the schools' articulation agreements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parsed articulation agreements through AWS textract and passed the resultant data through an algorithm to compile JSON files of articulated courses. We built our frontend using Swift to play to our assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS was giving us a nightmare of time setting up, however, once we overcame our challenges, we proceeded smoothly. Surprisingly enough, the scutwork of scraping pdfs took more time than compiling the UI.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created a tool that would be useful for a lot of college students. We preserved through our challenges and produced a solid product.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes manual work is better than the automated approach.
