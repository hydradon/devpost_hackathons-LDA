                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After arriving in DC we had a really hard time finding free parking that we felt we wouldn't be ticketed or towed for(&amp; didn't want to pay to park overnight), so while our initial plan was to make this for DC, we couldn't find a dataset that gave us what we needed so we made it for Baltimore.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the users current location and an Open Baltimore data library to determine if the user is safe (from tickets/towing) to park on the street address that they are at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Apache Cordova which allows you to write cross-platform applications using AngularJS.  We setup a simple api on Heroku to initially parse the data from the Baltimore Open Data project and store in on an AWS RDS instance which we can then query, based on user location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing some system settings when you aren't operating in native land (Settings which would have been easier to access had we written the app natively)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    �Making use of Baltimore open data project and making something we will actually use.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Learned about using Ionic for app development and node for apis.
