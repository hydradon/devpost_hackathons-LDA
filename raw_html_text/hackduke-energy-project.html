                    As a member of the Duke Climate Coalition, I wanted a website that provides resources for individuals interested in the environment to learn more about initiatives around the world and to help the coalition fight against Duke Energy's gas plant. I thought it was a decent idea and a pretty manageable task, so I decided to pursue it.

                <p>
                    The web app provides an interactive map to learn more about the environmental initiatives in the past, future, and present to anybody who wants to know about the energy and the environment. There are also resources available for people who want to support the environment through a quick, effective method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used the esri API to build the interactive map, and I also used Sublime to edit HTML from a bootstrap template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't know any html, javascript, and css or how to use APIs before coming to HackDuke. I'm just proud that I was able to create a finished project with very little prior experience. Using the API was a little difficult for me because I didn't understand a lot of the underlying code in the beginning, so that took an excessive amount of time. There was a lot of experimentation and googling when I was trying to edit the API to make my interactive map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back, I realized I covered a lot. Having rarely used any web development languages and minimal GitHub experience, basically everything I did was a new venture. I learned that Sublime is pretty cool and some of the basics of HTML, like adding hyperlinks, images, text, and formatting (just to name a few things). Getting better with GitHub was also a great experience. Being a CS major trying to learn code, GitHub is literally everywhere and it can be overwhelming trying to navigate the internet when everyone is using GitHub jargon like push, commit, pull, etc. Coming to HackDuke help alleviate the cloud of mystery surrounding all these verbs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what's next? I'm not really sure. I'll probably just continue editing the web app and updating the environmental initiatives. It's a good way to keep learning html and javascript too. Duke Climate Coalition also needs a website so maybe this is a good start, who knows?
