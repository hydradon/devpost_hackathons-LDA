                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give users a way track their own mental health through an interactive and responsive journal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows user to make a journal entry, and receive an accurate analysis of your emotions! The emotions are categorized as Fear, Anger, Disgust, Joy, and Sadness. Each emotion level is stored and tracked in a graphical interface, allowing for easy progression monitoring. The user can display their progress or analysis to their psychologists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using the IBM-Watson tone analyzer API, Google charts, and a MySql database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never worked with the IBM-Watson tone analyzer API before. In addition, we had trouble graphing the emotional values that were retrieved through the analysis.
