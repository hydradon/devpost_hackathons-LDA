                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As hackers who are constantly trying to learn new skills, we felt that it was hard to find good resources to learn from. Google would often turn up irrelevant or unrelated results, and when we did find a good resource, it would be hard to find 5 other related ones that tied the subject together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delve gives you a list of resources for any kind of CS related skill you want to learn. In addition, it makes it easy to get started learning about a skill, as it shows a short description of the skill and which companies use it, to help you get motivated.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend uses React.js and the backend uses Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to format the frontend the way we envisioned it. In addition, we could add a lot more backend features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a running site that communicates from frontend to backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not too difficult to get started with React.js and Python to make a website, but to go more advanced requires a lot of skill!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adding more features and resources for each topic!
