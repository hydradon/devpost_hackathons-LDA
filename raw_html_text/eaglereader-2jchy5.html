                    Eagle Reader is an application built for visually impaired, dyslexic or handicapped individuals that do not have the privilege to read. EagleReader can convert books into AudioBooks which can be listened to comfortably. Its an intuitive application that uses Google Cloud Vision (OCR) service to provide an accurate translation to text in several languages, from files of multiple formats.

                    We added a speech recognition feature  with the goal of making the app accessible to a wider market while keeping its  UI intuitive and simple for users.

                    Reading is a very important part of education and the stories you listen to as you grow up helps you develop your personality and have a better understanding of people and your surroundings. Not all books are available as audiobooks unfortunately, so people who are visually impaired are limited in this aspect. EagleReader helps convert scanned books and PDFs into audiobooks, which will make more books accessible for the visually impaired.
For people who like reading, reading becomes a habit more that a hobby after a while, and having to change that due to unseen circumstances(Cataract, Lasic, etc) is challenging. EagleReader helps individuals get through this.
