                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays the price the users pay for smart home technology is high - users have to buy a control hub (such as Amazon Echo and Google Home) and update their existing electronic appliances (Air Conditioners, Lights, etc.) to integrate smart home technology into their houses. Therefore, we try to bring smart home technology to more people. We built a system that allows users to add smart home features to their houses without buying any new hardware.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project contains two parts: the voice-enable app on the smartphone and the controller to control electronic appliances. To use this system, the users just need to speak to the smartphone app, and then the app will understand the user's voice command and order the controller to finish the task (such as turning on the lights, change the settings of Air Conditioner) accordingly.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the speech-to-text system using google speech API. The hardware controller is built using Arduino 101&amp; Arduino UNO. Communication between smartphone and Arduino is achieved by using Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy.

                <p>
                    Using Google Cloud Speech API to transcribe speech to sentences. 
Using Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy to synchronize data between different devices.
