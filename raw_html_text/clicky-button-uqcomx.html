                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us has much experience in coding, but we thought it would be fun to HackTCNJ to come and learn. We brainstormed in the Android Development Workshop and discussed with the mentor how it would be possible to bring our idea to life, and that we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clicky Button is similar to Hot Potato. A timer is randomly set and two people pass a phone back and forth to bring down that timer. The timer goes down while holding down the button, so dropping the phone in the middle of gameplay is not an issue. Once the timer hits 0, the screen changes, and it is Game Over. The person holding the phone when that happens wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT App Inventor's block coding to set up the game. Using 4 different screens, we were able to include a How to Play section, a home screen, the game screen, and the Game Over screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was both of our first times using this program, as well as block coding in general so it was quite difficult to get a basis for how it worked and how many options there were. After working with it, we began to understand, but to get to that point was difficult. Additionally, neither of us have Android phones! It was so difficult to work on a project and not really know if it was going to work without the ability to check on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed our first mobile app and game. But more than that, we are leaving HackTCNJ with more knowledge than we came in with. To us, that is a win even if our incredibly simple game doesn't score us a victory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the MIT App Inventor, and how to think as the program does. We applied ourselves to accomplish the task at hand. Despite the seemingly impossible task at hand, we learned not only to accomplish it but feel confident in our abilities to progress in computer science.

                    Further design elements, a more interesting color scheme, etc.
