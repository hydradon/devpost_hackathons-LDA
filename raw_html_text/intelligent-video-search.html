                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tool that provides the ability to search videos based on semantic content has obvious use cases, from finding videos online, to finding videos one has shot on their own cell phone or devices.  We think that a video search tool that actually shows where in a clip a given search query can be found would be immensely useful for video editors.  Imagine a documentary film editor whose job it is to sift through hundreds of hours of footage.  If the editor can quickly find all of the exact moments in clips containing a "sunrise", wouldn't this save a lot of organizational time and effort, and potentially greatly accelerate their creative process?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows content-based search of a video library using speech input. A web UI is provided for making queries and viewing the relevant videos.
