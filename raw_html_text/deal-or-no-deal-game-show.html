                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom and i love watching the game TV show Deal or No Deal. That's when something hit me, i love using my alexa echo show, why not build an APL just for the echo show device. Later design it for the big screen LG TV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Experience first hand of the real life game as if you were in the game show.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Node.js and both Authoring tool and Simulator provided by Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noticed that both device rendering and simulator are not the same. found a lot of issue. However, i designed this skill based on the simulator and later was going to fix it so it works on the device as well. I wish i had more time did not get a chance to finish the BANKER's offer and daily winning by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to go through the entire APL understand all it's use case and somewhat create a small working deal or no deal device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to render using APL. Also Javascript :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deal or no deal Game Show
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure the Bank Offer appears. I have used a lot of image from the actual game show on windows, however, even using those images are not easy because i had to photoshop the cases, the amount hightlights, the background etc.
