                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hearing the unending horror stories of rape cases and injustice that happens with innocent men and women around the world, we were inspired to make a change. This platform intends to increase awareness and transparency about rape kits that do not get tested in labs, and ensure the kits are traceable and secure during the DNA testing process. Blockchain technology provides a huge opportunity for officials to be held accountable and victims to be aware of what stage of processing their data is currently at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The blockchain is intended to be a public record of the status of all kits (that are pending and have already been processed) at any point in time. A victim is asked to create an account. They will receive a private key, which encrypts their public key. This public key cannot be traced to the victim in any way. They will also be asked to enter their serial number of the kit, and this number is entered into the blockchain. Once processed in a lab, lab technicians sign into the web app and verify the processing is complete. Once the victim also verifies its complete, it will show in the public ledger as complete. Otherwise, it will display as incomplete.
