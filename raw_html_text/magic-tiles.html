                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our experience with past games, we wanted to create a game controller that was cheap and intuitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distances are logged via sensors, and we compute the user's choice based on their steps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two ESP8266 modules, each connected to an ultrasonic sensor. They are set up to read two seperate distances, representing a just dance floor pad. The distances are logged and sent via TCP to a server, which turn the corresponding steps to an action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ESP8266s were prone to a huge amount of flash errors especially when trying to upload code. Moreover, there were many issues with network latency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ESP, TCP and ultrasound; the first time for many.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Magic Tiles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another sensor, to create a 3 by 3 grid. Potentially have movable sensors to adapt controls to step size of players.
