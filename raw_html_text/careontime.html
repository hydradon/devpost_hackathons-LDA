                <p>
                    Across the country, community-care providers are working to support older people living in their homes. With their limited mobility and access to the community, these older people are reliant on their service providers to provide a wide range of support from clinical services to general help at home to social outings or even just sitting and having a chat. For people with such a strong reliance on these service providers, not knowing who is coming to visit and when can create high levels of anxiety for the person waiting at home alone.

                        Developed Round 1 Prototypes - Google Assist programming, wireframes of customer application, first dev of staff application
The google assistant supports the features of smalltalk, which is especially important for older people that don not have frequent interaction with others. On top of that it integrates into all other features of the google assistant, i.e. calling people, making calender entries. Our home assistant also can tell jokes to people to keep them entertained while waiting. The google assistant can be easily expanded to many different features and in the future could support features like scheduling an doctors appointment, collect several data about the voices, videos and pictures of the older people in order to alert emergency in case of falls and heart attacks. Furthermore this application will be the stepping stone into technology for many aged people, that might not be familiar with technology. Therefore we used voice recognition so the older people do not need very limited knowledge of technology to use it.

                    Home health care services visit and nurse various patients on a daily basis. The determination of the optimal routes, which nurses have to travel, is essential. One of the most important constraints is the consideration of recurring fixed announcements and the assignment of each patient to the same nurse at each visit if possible. This way, patients will have a regular daily routine without a need to get accustomed to different nurses again and again. Additionally, &ldquo;no-shows&rdquo; and emergencies have to be scheduled at short notice and it has to be decided which patients on the waiting list can be fitted into the schedule.In the future a sophisticated online routing system, that is tailored specifically to the health care industry will be integrated into the backend of the app. 
This system will support multiple restrictions, like Annie does not like male carers or wants to be taken care on a specific day. We see the applications as a stepping stone into the older peoples home and introducing them to technology.
