                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the rise in smart homes, powered by chat bots, I felt there was a lack in visual medium with the portrayal of these chatbot assistants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a 3D rendered character who processes voiced audio data received from Amazon's Alexa API, and then renders appropriate lip movement and facial expressions in realtime. (A face for Alexa).  The goal was to present her via  projection mapping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the AVS (Amazon Voice Service) as well as Unity3D.  I implemented Unity Plugins that morphed shapes with audio input, and applied it to the facial features of the 3D character.  She is then projected onto a physical 3D model via projection mapping

                    What's next for The Face of Alexa - A realtime 3D face for the AVS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps, in the future, I can map textures built from old family members to the 3D character.  And thus simulate a real life (Harry-Potter-like) talking portrait.
