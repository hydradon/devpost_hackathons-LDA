                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IOS Reminder app and polar clocks.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polar Reminder lets the user input reminders/events, specific to the second if needed. That information is processed and displayed on a polar clock for the user to see. The app assists with time management since the user will have a visual idea of when his/her events are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and its Graphics2D GUI to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to learn how to use the GUI. It was also difficult to calculate where the events should be on the Cartesian coordinate (pixels) when user inputs are dates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is designed to be very easy to modify aesthetically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use simple rendering functions of Graphics2D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Polar Reminder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to retrieve user input dynamically when the user presses a button on the app and display event information when the user. Additionally, we want to be able to include color themes the user can select to personalize their polar clock.
