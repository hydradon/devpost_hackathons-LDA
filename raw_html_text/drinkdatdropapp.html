                    Drink Dat Drop was inspired by a few Slack posts we all received at the beginning of this hackathon.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rewind...
organizer-ying: "@channel WATER!! please stay hydrated this weekend. water bottles are located outside the hacking"
organizer-sampurna: "Water is also in the middle of the hacking area now!!"
laurenyoohoo: "Where can i get water"
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are good comments and questions. It is very important for the human body to be given an appropriate amount of water to stay hydrated. The symptoms of dehydration are not only here to annoy us while we try to hack the next greatest idea of the century, they are reminders from our body that we should take seriously. But how much should you drink? Should you even drink? And where can you get water if you need some?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drink Dat Drop can answer all of these questions for you. It is an application that, using your weight and the symptoms you are experiencing, tells you if you should drink some water, if yes, how many ounces, and where you can find some water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Drip Dat Drop is currently only available on a couple of platforms, the future is bright for the app! In the future, you will be able to attach a sensor to your favorite bottle; that sensor will weigh your bottle at regular interval and will thus know whether you've been drinking or not, without you even thinking about it! And since your hydration needs also depend on the amount of exercise you do during the day, you'll be able to connect Drink Dat Drop to your fitbit, Apple watch, or any other smart device that can track your exercise. And since your weight might fluctuate without you even noticing it, just connect Drink Dat Drop to your Withings scale, or any other smart scale you own. Finally, you'll be able to check out water stations are your favorite events and venues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very soon, you won't need to think about your hydration, because we'll be here to let you know that you need to Drink Dat Drop!
