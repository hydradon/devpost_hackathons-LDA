                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make something really meaningful with Alexa and the Twilio API to help those with mental health disorders... But AWS to me is worse than PHP so I had to give up on my dreams and make this instead. Twilio is bae &lt;3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text the twilio number to join the lobby, take turns to add text to the story
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still have no clue how to get anything useful out of AWS, but Freehostia just got up and running like that.
                    <em>
                        snaps fingers
                    </em>
                    . So I uses Twilio's TwiML to make calls to my PHP scripts to manage the running of the application.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    AWS... AWS.... AWS....

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was done in about 2 hours... and learning to switch to a more viable project is a pretty important thing to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes products and services are overhyped, and simply trying to go for a sponsor prize can be detrimental to a hack's success.

                    Would probably need to remake on Node.js
