                    Inspiration for SudCycle comes from frustrating times when the washer or dryer cycle is complete but no one is around to take action. SudCycle helps by sending a text message to alert you the cycle has run its course. This works by sticking the SudCycle Pod onto the appliance knob and recording the alert point in the SudCycle webapp. The SudCycle Pod will turn with the knob until it reaches an alert point at which time it will send a text message via Wifi to the user. Now clothes don't have to smell funny from sitting wet in the washer or wrinkle in the dryer.
