                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved the idea of making a fun game that brings people together in a cool and fun way!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LED lights we used for this project react to the state of the game of tug of war in real-time (essentially). When players go on their phone, they can use it as

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main center piece is the Nanoleaf light panels, which are colour-changing triangular-shaped LED lights! Our main tech stack included React for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend. We leveraged available APIs to make use of WebSockets for the commucation between devices, as well as to the lights we were using!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenge we ran into was configuring the LED lights programmatically. Another notable challenge was setting up the WebSockets properly so that Client devices, the backend server and our other backend client were able to communicate as intented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely got a deeper understanding of how to implement WebSockets, as well as programming with smart LED lights.
