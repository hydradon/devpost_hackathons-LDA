                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many different facets of healthcare, one of them being public awareness. However, in today's times, when 55% of all page views get less than 15 seconds of attention, it is important that we present information to users in an effective manner. Through this necessity, our Text Summarizer application was born. We thought that this tool would also be particularly useful to those with disabilities. Considering the rise in availability of text to speech programs, we thought our model could help them digest information more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code takes in a link to an article on Science daily and outputs a summary based on our algorithm. 
We chose this website in particular because we thought that our approach to text summarization would work best
on research articles. It also helped that this website had existing summaries so it shortened the time we took to check our model for accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Python web server was built using a microframework called flask. As the python application cannot directly access the URL from the web application, the web server makes this possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a link is input, our webscrapper retrieves the title and the text of the article using the 
Beautiful Soup 4 library. This data is then input into the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model uses a fill in the blank approach to text summarization. A word is added to a bag of words if it is next to a key word (these are defined in the code).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first sentence's blanks are filled with the words that have the highest weight in the bag of words.
The second sentence requires a phrase to be filled in. This is filled in through a similar method described above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The selling point of this model is that grammar is less likely to be a problem as most of the grammar is filled out by us.
The model only needs to retrieve words or phrases to fill into already complete sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another advantage of this model is that it can be adapted to any website with relative ease.
