                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first met each other and talked about our backgrounds we learned that we came from two educational backgrounds- CS degrees and Engineering degrees. As we were discussing the pros and cons of both degrees, there was one constant theme dominating the conversation - the ability to problem solve elegant solutions to wicked problems. We realized that there needs to be more oppurtunity to develop this brand of thinking for people who don't have ready access to all of the resources we do. At the same time, one of out group members mentioned how at one hackathon he couldn't get something to work because AdBlock was blocking requests to an API. There was a joke about not being able to use the chrome developer tools properly and an idea was thought about to bring these two elements together.
