                    Unfortunately the API is incomplete, by now it only supports single player games. The coding process was a complete rush, since I didn't have the whole weekend to work on this. I hope you guys like! :)

                        1. How long did the assignment take?
                    </strong>
                    15 hours.

                        2. Did you learn anything new in the process?
                    </strong>
                    Yes. I started the project from the domain, but then realised there were a couple details that I ended up changing to make the business logic fit on the framework. Also, I ran into some troubles while setting up the framework.

                        3. What was the hardest part?
                    </strong>
                    Fix some spring boot issues :/

                        4. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it  be?
                    </strong>
                    To practice more with the framework I would use, to avoid discovering things in the middle of the hackathon :P
