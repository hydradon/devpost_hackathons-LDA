                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from Blockchain's ability to democratize data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a framework that imports realtime medical data from wearable devices (Apple Watch HealthKit), and registers with a unique identifier (Public Key) on the Ropsten Blockchain Protocol. Our frontend provides a portal for individuals and medical companies to exchange personal data for Ether (Ethereum's cryptocurrency). We also notify the user when a purchase is being made of their data using Twillio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are leveraging the power of the Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG) and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure personal data during a B2C transfer, something that has is inherent in the nature of Ethereum contracts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and yes, tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Operating on the Live Ropsten Test Network. Blockchain technology is still in its early development stages, we encountered many bugs and issues deploying the Test Network that had not previously been exposed. Getting the test network to run properly took up the majority of our time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to write scripts to mine ether before being able to make transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We had difficulty :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing automated scripts for purchasing Ether.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully functional private Blockchain on AWS.
A system that successfully governs the usage of data by a set of distributed nodes.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to integrate this with several Medical apps &amp; Insurance Company websites.
Implement more uses cases such as social media data security, and licensing.

                <p>
                    Work on the maturity of the program.
