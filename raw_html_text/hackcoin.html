                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is the wave of the future, and the Ethereum distributed computing platform is at the forefront of that wave. We aim to create a system that rewards good behavior in a simple and fair manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will provide incentives to users to compete beneficial goals. 
There will be an administrator of the goal that handles the successful completion of the goals.
When the goal is completed, the user will be paid in either Ethereum or a custom-made token.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Ethereum platform supports smart contracts, which are essentially programs that run on many nodes at once and provide a way to make transactions in a trusted way. We are using the Solidity language to write our contracts, which define the final outcome, whether the users are rewarded for good behavior or not. 
We will allow each contract to contain multiple 'winners', with the payout divided fairly among them if they fulfill the requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of our group had to learn Solidity (the Ethereum language for smart contracts) as well as the Ethereum Web3 API. Setting up a test wallet and environment took a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up an Angular.js web application that successfully deploys smart contracts to the Ethereum test-net.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine through the Solidity programming language. We also gained knowledge in web development with Angular.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackCoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group aims to further expand our experience with Ethereum and deploy a usable web application to allow our original use case to be accomplished in a user-friendly manner. The final goal is to allow groups to be formed in order to accomplish any goal, and to reward good behavior.
