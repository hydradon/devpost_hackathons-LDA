                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work hard now, so that we could work less later.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Study Stack takes in any .txt file and converts it into usable flashcards, that can be accessed through an easy-to-learn UI. Users can save different sets of flashcards and view their study progress at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Study Stack using Java and JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to manage the runtime cost. A huge challenge was solving the sentence parsing, specifically how to accurately mark words as either nouns, verbs, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thrilled that it works. We are mostly excited about how flexible and easy it is to create a set of flashcards from any set of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of useful skills such as sentence parsing, memory management, teamwork, and communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Stack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to add functionality for more input file types/documents as well as having capabilities to scrape information from websites. Since it is in Java, it would be easily converted to an Android app for access to a much larger market. Releasing Study Stack as a website would make the program even more accessible for students and other users.
