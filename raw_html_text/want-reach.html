                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With 2 students who have killed themselves on campus recently, I wanted to create a platform to allow students and general individuals to reach out and mentor each other through there ailments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows people with similar/same illnesses to connect to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Flutter+Dart and a firebase for the database/server

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the recency of Flutter as a language, there are not a lot of support and external packages.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it's easier to stick it through something when you are passionate about it
