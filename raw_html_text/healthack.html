                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major issue in the healthcare system is patient data: files are not transferred easily between healthcare providers, patients do not have easy access to their entire health record when filling out forms, and delayed diagnosis results in longer patient wait times, which promote the persistence of chronic disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to streamline Ontario&rsquo;s healthcare system by providing an personal, easy-to-access health record coded onto the Ontario Health Cards for patients and healthcare providers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phase I: Compiling/Storing Data ----&gt; currently implemented
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two Types of Accounts: 
1) Patient: User can upload any recent symptoms and concerns and non-prescribed medications like Tylenol, vitamins, etc. Information like prescribed medications and medical history will be retrieved from healthcare providers whose information is entered. 
2) Doctor/Healthcare provider: User can upload/update prescriptions, diagnose symptoms, recommend specialists and courses of action, suggest scheduling of appointments, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The medical information retrieved from various medical institutions around the globe will eventually be converted to a common format in healtHack. This is a crucial step in our ambitious goal of standardizing medical records around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase II: Sharing
Every account will have a corresponding medical ID. This is the key that connects patients to doctors and healthcare providers with whom they wish to share their information with. 
Patients have the choice to sell or share their information for research purposes in exchange for perks and promotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phase III: Future Improvements
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistency
We want to invest the time to convert all medical records into a common format regardless of healthcare provider and country. This is the first step to globalized, quality healthcare that is easily accessible no matter when and where you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Funding
We can support ourselves without funders. Healthcare providers will pay to join as this streamlines and immensely simplifies their service. As healtHack begins to gain momentum, it may begin to replace/modify the current health system and gain government funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How healthcare providers benefit
Hospitals, walk-in clinics and medical centres can now send in records of their patients into our  secure blockchain network that is accessible anywhere at anytime. They aren&rsquo;t required to keep track of massive databases. They can also securely access records of foreign or travelling patients. This is an investment into the future of more improved and global healthcare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mobile app
As the web application develops, a mobile app can be implemented to further facilitate accessibility on the go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lifestyle Improvements
As healtHack gains momentum and builds a solid network of users, they can consent to sharing/selling their information for research purposes. This can help us use the trends in their medical information to suggest healthier lifestyle changes and indicate possible areas of concern by comparing them with the average. For instance, we can incorporate an additional API to show useful information, articles, lectures, etc. relevant to users&rsquo; health conditions should they choose to share their information

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steps: 
Brainstorm concept
Split roles (Agile)
Abbey and Laura: Back-end, 
Athy: Details/Conceptualization
Tori and Irene: User interface/Web-development (front-end) and User test
Coding:
Pseudocode/Code into blockchain how to store and visualize data
After input of symptoms and information -&gt; ask to rank severity
Implement Tori&rsquo;s web design into code
Backend troubleshooting
Prompt to update account
Conceptualization:
Define vision and purpose of healtHack
Explain the various phases of healtHack
Document changes and improvements 
User Interface:
Design the user interface
Design user interface with paper prototypes and digitized prototypes
Troubleshoot design using user test

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After fleshing out the details of the concept and making sure it is practical to society, the hardest challenges came in incorporating API into our code. Although in theory, we knew that we wanted stdlib to play a part in the message board of healtHack, finding the right place for it in our code was very difficult. We received a lot of help from the professionals of stdlib and managed to find a way around our previous errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    stdlib was also not compatible with atrigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project was ambitious so we couldn't code everything within the time allotted, but we tried our best to produce tangible results.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As many of us haven't coded before, we are proud of all the new lingo and softwares that we learned today. It was also the first time writing code for some of us, so it was a real accomplishment when we were able to implement working code, for the backing of our site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what blockchain was and how it can be incorporated into our lives. We continued to implement blockchain into our project: healtHack and thus learned about how substantial of an impact blockchain can make in our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a website in under 3 hours for the first time. We learned about APIs and even begun to code an API into healtHack as an access point between medical records and healthcare providers.
                </p>
