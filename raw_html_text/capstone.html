                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized our best learning came not from memorization and quizzes, but actual projects and experiences. When we carry out tasks and overcome obstacles, we gain a deeper mastery of that concept or skill - whether it is programming, medicine, or art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not alone - a study on experiential learning found information is better retained and contextualized when you learn by doing. In a 3-month study of medical students performing a complex task, the group that learned through actions achieved a whopping 64.5% success rate compared to the 36.9% baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is our traditional lecture and classroom model fails to deliver that dimension of education.

                <p>
                    Capstone transforms the traditional syllabus into a live learning experience, by identifying a course's key concepts and linking to real world opportunities.
