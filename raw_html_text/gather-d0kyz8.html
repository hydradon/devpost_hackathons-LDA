                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How many times have you been hungry, and you and your friend couldn't reach a mutual agreement on a restaurant? That inspired us to develop Gather, a matchmaking service based off of food preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gather is inspired by the idea that people bond over meals. The app allows users to easily decide on a restaurant or coffee shop together amongst all the choices available. However, it also provides users the option to get out of their comfort zone and meet new friends at the restaurants they love. One of the problems people face now is meeting new people, especially once they are no longer in school or in an environment where such encounters happen often and naturally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with objective-c and the UI, UX, and animations were made with Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to incorporate the Twilio API as a notification center to inform your friends through your contacts that you have the app downloaded. We also wanted to integrate more endpoints from the Foursquare API to the cards.
