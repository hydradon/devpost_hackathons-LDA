                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    August of last year there was a tragedy in El Paso that shook the city. A couple years back in UT Austin, there was a student that was murdered on campus at night while she was walking back from class. This terrified the Austin community and created a panic amongst the students.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our concept is a safety app that brings the community together. It will use the Waze open source code to create the virtual map that locals can fill out in real time. there is a feature where users can add pins to safety locations so that if someone is in danger they can have a safe place to hide. It also has a feature where we can add the app to the lock screen so that if you are in immediate danger you can press it and it will send your geolocation to your emergency contacts and alert the police.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used Marvelapp and photoshop o create the prototype. To create a map that updates in real time, out plan was to use an open source code for the Waze app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding the app because our team is composed mostly with Business students that do not have any background in CS or programming.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a visual (prototype) and make a market research in under 36 hours!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    probably a CS major or at least some one with a medium programming knowledge would be very helpful.

                <p>
                    We are going to create a prototype that people can attach to their clothing, that will use sonar detection to alert them if someone is approaching them in their surroundings
