                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The endless need to be insulted in the most efficient way to inspire physical fitness led us to the only potential candidate for our personal trainer: Gordon Ramsay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Gordon Ramsay's voice to continuously influence you to continue improving your exercise routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Leap Motion to obtain the movement data. We then used the raw input to figure out the direction and speed of each individual hand. Gordon knows when you're slacking on your workout, and he doesn't hold back his judgement. To synthesize his audio, we simply taught ourselves audio engineering. All of this comes together in a C program that can track your movements and apply Gordon's words appropriately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time stopped working, espeak
                    <em>
                        seriously
                    </em>
                    lacks documentation, finding instances of Gordon Ramsay speaking specific words, and audio engineering voices from various sources to sound similar.

                    The meme.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing brings people together, and gets people to laugh more, than a group of college students deciding to meme on a large project.
