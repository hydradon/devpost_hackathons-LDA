                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this game came from a combined appreciation of Super Mario Bros, a simple, yet highly enjoyable two-dimensional platforming game.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parkmour is a video game for Windows and Mac, and it allows for one user to play six different levels
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I used the Unity Engine in order to build our game. We used C# as our scripting language and Blender as our three-dimensional modeling tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge we ran into was preventing our initial character controller script to permit the player to cling to walls. In order to fix it, friction on each object in the scene had to be modified a specific way and the code needed to be slightly altered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing a framework that can be repeatedly built upon to quickly add new levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work within the scope of a given project. For example, we learned that twenty-four hours is not enough to time to learn a whole new game engine from scratch, so we stuck to what we knew for the most part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Parkmour
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More levels will be coming in the future with new features and ideas.
