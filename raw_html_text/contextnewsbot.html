                    We&rsquo;ve all been in never-ending arguments with friends and family on critical issues like politics, international events or religion in the past. In recent years, however, we see a trend in people blindly trusting &lsquo;facts&rsquo; they learnt from a

                    <li>
                        The inability of people to create an internal filter against their own bias has caused the proliferation of false (or somewhat false) information to plague modern society and is slowly leading us to

                            a world with only polarizing opinions
