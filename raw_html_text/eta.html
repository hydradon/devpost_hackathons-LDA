                    interfaces with the American Airlines, Google Maps distance matrix, and Text Magic APIs to give the Amazon Echo the information it needs to make your life easy. The result is an audible and SMS reminder for when you need to leave for the airport. The SMS text message send to your phone even includes the fastest route to the airport based on your current location.
