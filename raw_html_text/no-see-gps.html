                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the advent of many new ways to interact with an environment thanks to technology such as those used in virtual reality and weables, what other ways could the world be perceived? Originally wanted to use the phase heat exchanger units for virtual reality applications or "you're getting warmer" (as you get closer to something) use. The phase heat exchanger could easily reach extreme cold/heat which would not be ideal for a person to hold, so we switched to vibration feedback and a different application.

                    Handeling Android M new permissions management. Sending RESTful requests to the microcontroller for the vibration motor controls.

                    Everything works well if the RESTful request would function properly.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of android programming. The new permission request for Android M API level was much different than before and took a bit to learn. We also learned how to use many of google's services such as voice to text, location, and navigation services in tandem with our application code.

                <p>
                    Put a compass on the guiding cane and make it into a true smart guiding cane. Maybe add bluetooth functionality like a normal mobile device peripheral.
