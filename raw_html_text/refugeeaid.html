                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The refugee crisis in Middle East and Europe is a big challenge for the whole world. Technology cannot solve this challenge, but it can at least improve the lives of the people who are suffering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android app helps humanitarian workers in refugee camps distribute humanitarian aid among the refugees. The workers can mark on the map where the help is needed, and other workers immediately see it and can come with help. It allows to create custom maps for refugee camps, different types of help and assign priorities, thus making the administration of the camp and the distribution of the aid more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built with Java, while the back end with nodejs and mysql. It is hosted on the Google Cloud platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use hosting services and integrating different technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That this app is actually something that can actually improve lives of large amounts of people.

                    Back-end is hard.
