                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the TD speaker's quote "Invest in you." As young adults on a tight budget, we feel guilty for spending money on leisure. To us, "Invest in you" means saving money for the future but also taking time for yourself or spending it with others, which sometimes requires spending. With our budgeting app, Balance, we want to encourage young adults to spend their money wisely and on experiences that contribute to their well-being.
