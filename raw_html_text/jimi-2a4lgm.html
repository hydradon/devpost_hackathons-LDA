                    When Goh Sato gets together with friends, they love talking about two things
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Software Engineering
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Music
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    However, because all his friends are so eager to share their taste in music, when Goh is designated to bump the AUX cord, he finds difficulty taking different music requests from his friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he thought. What IF there was a way
                    <br>
                    &ldquo;to create a collaborated playlist, so that Goh doesn&rsquo;t constantly act as a DJ.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, jimi was conceived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By linking the participants&rsquo;s Spotify account,  the third party application can successfully connect users to a &ldquo;party room&rdquo;,  which users connect through a 6 digit numeric provided by a host&rdquo;. Once connected, the app shuffles user&rsquo;s top hits (within the last 4 months) into a collaborative playlist; shared with others possessing the unique ID.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Jimi, we hope to allow music culture to flourish, as many GREAT artists are undiscovered in today&rsquo;s music industry.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django for the API calls and React for the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Spotify API has several hoops to jump through front end is a pain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amount of caffeine consumed :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To pace ourselves during the 24 hours. 
1 cup of coffee = 2 bottles of water. 
Also, use the bathroom often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for jimi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our development was focused towards the participant entering the &ldquo;party code.&rdquo; Due to time constraint, we weren&rsquo;t able to develop ideas such as ( skipping songs, a notification that informed users when a new participant entered the party, and even a live scrollbar )
