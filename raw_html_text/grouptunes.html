                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GroupTunes was inspired by trips in a van when many individuals wanted to play songs over the van speakers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GroupTunes is an Android app that hosts a webpage on the host-phone. Other phones can then connect to it through that phone's IP Address and select songs to add to the playlist. (At least that was the vision :) ).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with Android-Studio for the Android portions of it. I wrote the html for the webpage, and nanohttpd is the library we used to host the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right off the bat, Android-Studio didn't want to cooperate with us. After figuring that out, getting nanohttpd to host the webpage was quite challenging and it only hosts individual pages so all of the css had to be inline. We still haven't gotten the upload and queue features working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of getting nanohttpd to host a webpage from our application and figuring out the rudimentary basics of media playback in Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android, GitHub, and hosting webpages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GroupTunes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to have full functionality, preferably even have it pull from Spotify.
