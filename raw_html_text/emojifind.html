                    <p>
                        You are typing in a chatroom with your best buds and you find the perfect opportunity to use a certain emoji. You open a new tab and search for your emoji on Google and you finally find it and copy it onto your clipboard. But, by the time it took to get back to your chat, you realize that the conversation has shifted to another topic and you feel disappointed that it took long to express your emotions. This common problem inspired our team to create a seamless and elegant solution.

                    <p>
                        For our frontend, we used Electron alongside Html/CSS. With Node.js, we were able to use JavaScript for both our frontend and backend. With our backend JavaScript code, we interfaced with a Microsoft Face API to obtain numerical values for the emotions, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, and sadness. Then, we compared these obtained values with a database of emotion values of 15 emojis. The best 4 emojis were then displayed to our frontend, which gives the user the choice to copy suggested emojis to the clipboard to paste into their chatrooms.

                        One problem we ran into was being able to access the laptop webcam to take a picture and passing it through to our API. Another problem we ran into was learning to simulate a keypress with JavaScript. A third problem was finding a way of searching for the closest matching emojis.
