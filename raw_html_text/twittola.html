                    We tried to develop other projects but unfourtunately we didn't succeed, so we thought about programming a webpage. Then we heard about Everis, who kindly ofered us his API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This API consists of two methods, one of them guess a text language and the other analyses the text and tells whether it is positive, neutral or negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Twitter API to read the last ten tweets of a user timeline and build an algorithm to calculate if the user has negative or positive karma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most difficult handicap we had to overcome was to write the code which allowed us to access the user timeline and read his last tweets. Fortunately we could download Twitter API and implement it in our code. At first it was a little bit tough to understand but finally we got it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem was to find a way to access the Everi's node, which for security issue it was unreachable.
We must be very grateful to Everis's stuff, who showed us one way to access the node and helped us develop the extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to say we have learned a lot during these 36 hours. We had never programmed in javaScript before, so this meant a challenge for us to make the extension run.
Twittola has actually exceeded our expectetives, but a next step could be reduce the number of nodes and make some interface improvements.
