                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the different use of a rating system.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paladin is a rating software extension. It searches the user's name and looks for social media and personal information that is public on the internet. It will give a rating out of 100. If they have their social media public or any personal information that may bring harm if public, then their rating will drop. Users can fix their poor practices and refresh Paladin to get a new rating.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, Python 3 and using an API called Zenserp. We went through planning to figure out all the details, for example, scoring, what Paladin will look for, and what is important. We also used GitHub to combine our codes and work together. Finally, we used Domain.com to create a website for Paladin. The website is bthpaladin.tech and we used Website Builder to build the design.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was that our original API, Serpapi, would return an XMLHttpRequest CORS error. This caused Paladin to not be able to return an adjacent file that is needed to carry out its purpose. We fixed the issue by using another API as we were unable to fully fix the issue even with the advice of the mentors. The API we used, in the end, is Zenserp.
