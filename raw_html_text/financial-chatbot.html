                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be great to have a chatbot handy to answer any of your financial questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our financial chatbot gives users the information they need to make informed decisions about their financial matters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used botkit, which is a tool for creating conversational automation, to manage the chatting interactions. Then we used BlackRock APIs to get financial information based on current markets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most significant challenges came from connecting the chatbot to the API. We were not familiar with the way we were supposed to call the API; however, once we got the API working, we were happy with our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we tried out some new APIs and made a cool, useful product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about chatbots and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Financial Chatbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to increase the feature set and make the chatbot widely available for those interested in getting useful financial information.
