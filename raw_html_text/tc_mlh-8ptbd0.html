                <p>
                    Me and my buddy came out with many great ideas but every single one of them have been shutdown because we could not use some tools from twitch or we did not have our third buddy come to TwitchCon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we decided to build an extension especially one that is not so available at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you click the extension you as the viewer have the ability to view a stream through it and you don't have to click to view it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition there is a box that asks who you would like to see.
It is currently limited to what you write in it so make sure to type in the proper streamers name.
                </p>
