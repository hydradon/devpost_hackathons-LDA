                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all probably left a window open when we weren't suppose to. This is especially troublesome if you have the AC or heater running as your money is literally blowing out of your windows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you hook our handy dandy device to a window, it detects when there is a drastic temperature difference between the indoors and outdoors based on the surrounding current. If there is too much wind, it'll light up and try to get you to notice the fact that you left your window open because in this case there's a high chance that you turned your AC or heater on without closing the window!! :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This simple and elegant circuit is made up of an arduino connected to an imu and a LED (which senses the movement) all attached to a piece of toilet paper :) why toilet paper? Its recyclable!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to figure out what sensor to use or how to connect the device to an effective part of the window but the toilet paper came through!

                    Our project is 80% recyclable :D.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes inspiration comes from the simplest things.

                <p>
                    Perhaps we will expand beyond toilet paper.
