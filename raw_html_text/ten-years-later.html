                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>        Our inspiration was multiple video games we played in our past that have had a significant emotional impact on us compared to other video games we have played. Our game has quite a dramatic and fast-paced story line. Although it is not as interactive as most games are, the plot makes it just as entertaining. We built the game using RPG Maker MV. Some challenges we struggled with occurred in the beginning, when we were not exactly used to using the program and had to repeatedly start over. We a quite proud of the fact that we were able to accomplish something we thought we wouldn't be able to within a certain amount of time. We are also very happy that we learned so much about something we never had experience with in the first place. We learned that it is important to be extremely patient and not stress out if something does not work or go as planned. We hope our game gives an emotional experience for its players and makes them feel a bond towards the characters within the story as they grow and develop. Most of all, we hope people have fun with it!
