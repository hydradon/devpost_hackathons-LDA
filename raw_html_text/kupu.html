                    The inspiration for our project came from project management and communication systems like Slack and Discord.  The app would require teachers to set up an account with the webpage.  Once the teachers log in, they will be able to chat with each other.  Teachers could have direct messaging.  Each school can create a domain and have their teachers as part of the domain.  Teachers would be able to search other teachers and message each other.  Teachers could post their resources on their pages.

                    So far, we have just built the user interface.

                    Challenges we ran into was not getting our code to work the right way and the alignment of the elements on the page.

                    There still needs to be a lot of work done with coding and the placement of the UI.  We learned that communication is key to this project along with getting everyone on task with what they were assigned to complete.

                <p>
                    The next things to do would be to fix the UI and work with PHP to make an actual chat between 2 people.
