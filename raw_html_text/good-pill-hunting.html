                    Good Pill Hunting is an intuitive and interactive way of keeping virtually everyone aware of medication they need to take. With features such as facial recognition, support from Amazon's Alexa, and an easy to work with user interface via cellular device allows for ease and comfort of use.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the first prototype, we utilized  a facial recognition system to recognize the customer's face. In order to dispense the proper medication, we programmed a servo motor to retract and drop the proper dosage of pills.

                    With any hackathon we ran into issues dealing with the availability of necessary tools needed to make our product over the top.
