                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our hectic lifestyle it is hard to find a moment for ourselves. Relaxzer combines calming landscape images with handpicked Deezer playlists allowing you to unwind.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relaxzer is an Android app that plays relaxing music while showing landscape images. At the moment it is a minimalist concept with no interface, so when opening the app it will randomly pick one of the curated playlists and show images.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Deezer API to build an Android app.

                    What's next for Relaxzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is intended to be used with Virtual Reality (VR) in the future. The idea would be to take a break from daily life listening to calming tunes while using VR goggles.
