                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An honest parody of the Terminator films and their themes of time travel, paradoxes and changing the future through your actions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a taxing action platformer that initially seems simple but reveals extra challenge as the player learns how to cleverly use their tools (a shotgun) and how their previous actions impact on the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity with no standard assets or templates. We used Photoshop for all the artwork and Apple Logic for the audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sheer amount of work. Very early on we made some reductions to the scope as it was clear we'd compromise quality in trying to achieve the initial concept. We continued to refine the scope as we assessed each bit of progress allowing us to focus on strengths and correct problem areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed a lot of hand-drawn animations which isn't our usual domain so we're quietly pleased with the results. We've also managed the project time well as we're delivering on time, having achieved what we wanted and still with a few hours for all important polish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even when you think an idea is simple, the amount of work can still be deceiving. Everybody loves a hefty dose of bassy sound effects and some screenshake when used appropriately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for I'LL BE BACK
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most likely some heavy critique from colleagues that spent their weekend in a far more relaxed state.
