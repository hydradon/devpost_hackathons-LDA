                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app for the holidays to help people organize the presents they want for the holidays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to make a three-item wish list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode in swift to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're beginners to app making so it took us a while to figure out how to do all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's our first app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The things that are seemingly the most simple actually can take a lot of complex thought and action.
                </p>

                    What's next for Wishlist Maker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a database and network for people to share their wish lists for the holidays.
