                    An awesome tool to help families and groups of friends who live in different parts of the country to join up at a common location with a common arrival time.  If you've ever tried to coordinate this type of travel with todays existing tools you would know just how difficult a thing this is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tool recommended for Travel business site or even as a Sabre implementation for their existing travel tools and API's.

                    Written in Meteor, and managed via GitHub... our team had two goals.. Have fun and learn new stuff.  Although we'd like more time to fully complete the project, we're enjoyed ourselves..
                </p>

                    Many thanks to the Sabre TTX team and support suppliers.
