                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of his quest to give names to the "emotions we all might experience but don't yet have a word for," writer John Koenig coined the word
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/igKea6GgTvI" rel="nofollow">
                        "Socha"
                    </a>
                    in 2015. Socha is "the kind of basic human vulnerability that we'd all find familiar," Koenig writes, "but is still somehow surprising when we notice it in others."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though imaginary, the term "Socha" captures very real incongruities with modern society. In particular, while every one of us faces our own private trials, tribulations, doubts, and disasters, societal expectation quashes any authentic expression of how we feel. And, while the world is more connected than ever, individuals are feeling increasingly isolated &mdash;&nbsp;even in the communities they are closest to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we created Socha, a mobile application that visualizes the collective mental health of your groups and makes it easy to get and give anonymous support. We created it with some simple goals in mind: Remove stoic veneers, and help  friends, peers, colleagues, and even strangers feel more connected to their respective micro and macro communities.
