                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the WiFi down for the major portion of the time, we wanted to come up with a fun hardware hack and this was born out of a crazy brain storming session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an exaggerated version of the "paper basket" game. You throw in a crumpled paper through the loop and if you get it right, the LED patch lights up, the BOSE sound touch 10 plays a crazy air horn sound and a tweet is sent out to celebrate your score. 
Also, the BOSE sound system can wake you up with an alarm thats chosen based on the weather that day. It also plays out the daily news for you every morning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this by rummaging through garbage and using our resources to the best of our ability. Cardboard is the body of our project and an Arduino and multiple sensors are the brain. We had the circuits and cardboard supports mounted and assembled. We used the Bose Soundtouch API to connect with the speakers and play the sounds.
A python script fetches the weather and chooses the song accordingly. The news for the day is also streamed using the API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble finding materials and relevant hardware.

                <p>
                    We did a fun hack and had a nice time exploring all the APIs.

                    Working with whatever materials we could find - Cardboard boxes,

                    Set up a public portal for various players to sign up and set up a leaderboard across companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game has so much potential in terms of expansion, specifically friendly competition between colleagues, and inter-company leaderboards.
