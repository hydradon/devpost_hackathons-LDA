                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team showed up at Hack Arizona with no idea of what we were going to create. After a some rather interesting brain storming, we kind of stumbled across the idea of tinder for dogs and wrote it off. We kept trying to move on, but the conversation always seemed to gravitate back towards this idea. It took some refining before we finally found a good approach that would help people, shelters, and lonely dogs searching for homes. The idea for the website quickly turned into a one stop shop for everything you would need to know about adopting a dog. A breed encyclopedia, doggie cost calculators, a search engine to find your next furry friend, and the capability for shelters to update dog information easily and avoid paperwork and complaints about how hard it is to find dogs on their websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website gathers tons of information about dogs and owning dogs, as well as lets you search for dogs once you've determined you are ready for one and have some specifications in mind. It also allows shelters to easily add information on dogs they are housing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website uses html, javascript and css for the most part. We decided to keep it very basic because only two members of our team had any experience with web programming, and only one that is going to school for computer science. Everyone learned a ton of new things while working on this project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having so many inexperienced members on our team became quite the challenge. We had grand ideas for this site but only got to implement a very small portion of them. Some of our features broke when moving form the local machine to the web too and there was not enough time to troubleshoot. We have most of the aesthetic pieces up for the purpose of presenting the idea and have grand plans for the future of this site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment of the weekend was actually the idea development. When we came in on Friday, we had no idea what we wanted to work on and now we have the skeleton of what could be a great asset for the canine community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK! Web programming is something that a lot of people take for granted because we are constantly on the internet. It's really a lot of work, sometimes for the simplest things. We also learned that it felt great when you finally got that one thing to work that you've been fiddling with for hours. Our team is also awesome and we spent long hours bouncing ideas off of one another, both serious and silly. Laughter is the best way to make a daunting task seem a little more manageable. Next time we attend an event like this, we might try to find a project that is a little more feasible in the allotted time. We all drastically underestimated the amount of time this would take, and how long this would take while learning the languages as we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for K-Mine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would really like to do some more work on this site and then call around to shelters and see if they would be willing to use the website. How cool would it be to have a website we built helping dogs find forever homes? Pretty dang cool! If we were to successfully implement this site in the real world we would be implementing a database and developing a mobile app to complement the website.
