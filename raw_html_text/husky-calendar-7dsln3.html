                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is common consensus that time management is difficult, especially for college students. Even though some students started using Google Calendars, it is still time-consuming to take into consideration the professor office hours, TA office hours, math study center schedules, CLUE sessions... Many students aren't even aware of the resources available to them until the very end of the quarter. Won't it be great if there is an ultimate calendar that keeps track of the great Husky events?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Husky Calendar's goal is to alleviate student's burden to keep track of all their academic schedules. Ideally, the course staffs would be able to enter their office hours and tutoring schedules into the calendar and share it with all students enrolled in the course. Students would be able to choose different calendar views and plan ahead to go to those sessions if they need help on course materials, instead of spending a long time digging through syllabus and canvas only to discover, frustratedly, that the only non-conflicting schedule has already passed.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team mainly used Html5, Javascript, and CSS3 to build the website demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we attempted to use the Google Calendar API but it turned out that there are a lot of authorization issues we needed to overcome, so we decided to use mock-up data instead. We also explore many new concepts in Javascript and html5.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the project all of us have a basic understanding of Javascript and also explore the use of Codeshare to work on the project at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create UI elements dynamically using Javascript. Collaborating on Codeshare.

                    What's next for Husky Calendar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figure out how to connect the user information to a database and really hammer out our user interaction flow, since we mainly focus on learning how to build an interactive website for the majority of the hackathon.
