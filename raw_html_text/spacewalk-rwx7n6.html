                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going through a bunch of ideas we settled into experimenting with unity and creating a game. We started creating spheres and ended up building a solar system. We decided to then just use our solar system to make a educational game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has multiple sphere objects that are colored just like the planets. There is a start menu that lets you enter the game. There is no gravity so the planets are able to drop our of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and an IDE to build the software around the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever used Unity before. We had to start from scratch in order to just learn basic functionality. We had problems getting from scene to scene. We wanted the planets to explode which was a trouble we spent a lot of time on. We also had trouble adding the calculator into the developed game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the change between the two scenes was very difficult trying to learn how to do. When we finally figured it out we felt very accomplished. All of the small accomplishments like adding color was a huge feat since we started with no actual knowledge of game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to add functionality to objects. In general we just learned the basics of Unity and how to do small things like move the objects and change their colors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpaceWalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot we want to do next. We want to actually make it into a functioning game where you can lose and win. We want the planets to be able to explode when the player gets the problem right and also introduce in the calculator algorithm in order to add the educational value.
