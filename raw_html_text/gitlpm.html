                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git log is powerful, but in some ways, it isn't that flexible. gitlpm offers another way to view your commit and codebase history
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    gitlpm allows you to get various information regarding lines inserted and deleted, but also plots your commit history in a graphical png image.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing python, git, gawk, and gnuplot, I was able to create a simple, yet powerful application.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning and trying to use gnuplot to work with fully-piped data was a struggle, but I was eventually able to find a workaround.
