                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I downloaded the "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" soundtrack a while ago and would occasionally cue it up and make it like my own personal soundtrack. I figured I might as well formalize that.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stores a list of locations and associated songs and plays them when the user enters a certain radius near them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React-native.

                    React-native.

                <p>
                    We came out alive, for the most part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React-native can be a lot of work.
                </p>

                    What's next for Game Walker

                <p>
                    More UI tweaks: a background image associated with the current song, for instance. Also more OST packs, provided we don't get hit with a DMCA first.
