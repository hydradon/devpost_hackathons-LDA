                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music is very data intensive and so many people still don't have smart phones. Let's bring the music to them in modes that already exist and are cost effective (unlimited minutes anyone?)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You just text into the number 1(469)MoMusic with song lyrics or the name of a song and it will call you and play that song for you! Or call in and just listen to the "radio."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crazy stack interfacing with the user using Twilio, Parse to handle those requests, and Python/Flask on AWS to handle stripping the music from Youtube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Man getting the file formats and all to work out using ffmpeg took a while, but it all worked out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that it works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. Setting up that Flask server on AWS (my first Flask project) and a lot about audio file formats.
                </p>
