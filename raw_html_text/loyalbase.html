                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most shops/stores have loyalty programs. This inspiration came to me when I went to Smoke's Poutinerie and realized I lost my loyalty card. I lost a free meal ! (I almost cried tbh).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most shops/stores have loyalty programs. This program is designed to help automate the process of dealing with loyalty programs. It helps both the shop owner and the customer in making the process more reliable and easier to handle.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is built with Django. Couldn't find time to build the API and frontend javascript. I was single and had only 24 hours to complete the project.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I am still kinda new to Django, it was my first detailed project and I completely learned/got experience around how Django works.
                </p>

                    I am proud that I didn't give out when I ran into challenges and patiently produced solutions.
