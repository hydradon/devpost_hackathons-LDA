                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out with trying to think of uses for the Oura ring. While walking around the venue we discovered the Tieto smart building system and thought that we could integrate our health data with Tieto's office sensors and get some interesting results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It measures employee stress levels and uses that data combined with smart office building data to enhance the working experience in the office.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Tieto API and stress data we created an additional layer for the Tieto application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wifi problems and Tieto API mood swings slowed us down considerably as most of the development time was spent waiting for results from the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 canvas for this project but none of us had any previous experience with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced some difficulties retrieving the raw data from the wearable devices because of the subscription plan issue.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innovative and perspective idea. Getting to know the intelligent building setup. Using new APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New APIs, HTML5 Canvas, how to get data from different wearables.
                </p>
