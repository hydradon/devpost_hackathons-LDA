                    What's the move is a Progressive Web Application that aims to connect users to local businesses that they find of interest. Utilizing a reinforcement learning backend that serves as an efficient recomendation system, What's The Move can determine the optimal restaurant and experience for you to attend at any time of the day. This was inspired by our team's friendship, given that we attend different colleges. However, every time that there is a reunion, we ask one another "What's the move?" to determine where to eat and what to do.
