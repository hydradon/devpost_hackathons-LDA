                    Selecting the right device was a major challenge. The configuration of Azure components was also difficult.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of the amount of work we put in in order to interface with the Photon with the cloud, and mobile devices. Also of the amount of information that we processed and learned was a huge success.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned how to code on Particle's IDE for photon, configuring Azure, and using IFTT.  We also learned how to work with metawear device, and SDK's in Android Studio which were not used in final project.

                    Improvements to follow will be smaller form factor, and detection of other events such as seizures.
