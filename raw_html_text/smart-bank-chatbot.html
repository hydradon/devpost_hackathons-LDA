                    Context
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are in a world where artificial intelligence invaded our life, we have intelligent robots cleaning, cooking, robots with which you can have a discussion in different languages, that seems fancy Hein?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But mean while and in the same ''fancy'' world you still have to go out in -19 degree to the bank office to ask questions such as is it possible to invest in this business, is there a transfer going on from another country and the list goes on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We brought you the solution, a SmartChatBot that would make a direct connection between the client and his/her following bank agent if the question is too complex to be answered by the server itself, but our guy is not called smart for nothing, if the question-answered is of the kind that can be learnt, the agents will get rid of if so they don't feel like typing the same thing each day because the bot would easily learn it based on machine learning techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application would on the other hand save a lot of money from the bank side too, since you don't have to spend huge amount of money on call centers for instance!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart-Bank-Chatbot is composed of two interfaces (android and web) and a server on AWS. The customer can ask questions about his bank account on one interface. This question is transmitted to the server. If the question is easy (e.g see the account balance, consult the last transactions, ...), the server can directly answer the questions using the API from the open banking project. If the question is more complicated, it is forwarded to the bank counselor on the other interface. Moreover, the chatbot is able to learn from the previous questions in order to serve the costumer at its best.
Using this chat system, it is really easy for the customer to have a fast response to his question.
