                <p>
                    Hackathon technology challenge to come up with a viable disruptive innovation within 36 hours.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a technology platform to connect sensors that monitor environmental or industrial parameters.  These can include PM 2.5, humidity, temperature, and NOx.  This will also provide a platform to educate the community,from k-12 to professional, on the use of this disruptive technologies.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Using a non-centralized IoT LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network), we connected sensors to the LPWAN and sent the information to an app.  App will have the data showing what the sensor is recording.  Also we enabled push notifications.   Link to code is

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Capturing enough data in the allotted time frame, receiving the information, transforming the data into information for end users.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to have sensors work with the app.  Also being able to graph data as it comes in.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, exposure to other coding languages, sensor information, air quality information.

                    What's next for EPStrong Technologies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Also to publish analytics of past trends and predictive graphs.  Possibly deploy sensors in an open source project to have the community monitor the air quality.  This will allow for the community to allow them to leave polluted areas and show where areas that are less polluted. Other possibility is to commercialize the product and sell to companies wanting to monitor parameters in real time.  Commercialization implementations include monitoring machine sound volume or farmers can monitor humidity in crops.
