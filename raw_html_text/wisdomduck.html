                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we didn't come to this hackathon with an idea, we had to come up with something after we had arrived. We originally wanted to do an OAuth service that would log you in if you could sing Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up correctly (including pitch), but this project got about as far as the Azure Speech Services API. Instead, we decided to go with something simpler with the limited time we had left, which turned out to be this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WisdomDuck's premises of operation is simple. Loading the side displays the left facing duck, with a randomly generated snippet of wisdom. Clicking the duck flips the duck to be right facing and generates a new snippet of wisdom. Clicking again reverses the process, and this can be done infinitely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something that could be thrown together quickly since we had already invested a lot of time into SIgnInWithRick, which didn't turn out to function that great. As such, we went with a framework (ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC) that we knew would work for us and one that we knew we could deploy quickly. WisdomDuck is deployed as an Azure App Service through Visual Studio's publishing tool. A domain was obtained through Domain.com and we added DNS records for the Azure App Service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, due to limited time we wanted something we knew would work for sure. As such, this project did not have as much technical difficulty or interest in it, and was just more about designing something that would work across most screen ratios. We tested 16:9, 2:3, and mobile portrait and landscape ratios which all turned out well enough after some tweaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy with the design of the final product, and happy that it seems to work and scale correctly on all platforms to our knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the development of WisdomDuck we were able to practice web design principles and applying those principles in practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for wisdomduck
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more wisdom snippet possibilities, as well as different structures for snippets instead of the single fixed snippet structure we have right now. Polish is also a thing to consider for the future with a nicer frontend.
