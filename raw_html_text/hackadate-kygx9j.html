                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our motivation is to discover true love based on facial features that the user deems desirable.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program uses Microsoft's Cognitive Services Face API to compare a photo URL entered by the user to a database of faces previously entered in the dating profile. The program will check all faces and return the faces that look the most similar to the face on the image entered, and will return a URL to access the most similar photo.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is based on using Node.js to implement Microsoft's Face API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was the first Hackathon for all of our members, and we entered the competition with no experience in using APIs or Node.js. Because of this, the largest challenges we faced include just figuring out what an API was and how to implement and use it, in addition to figuring out syntax challenges with Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we figured out how to use and implement APIs for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Microsoft's APIs and Node.js to implement an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackaDate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to take this proof of concept a step further and create an actual app running the same API that would allow people to create their own profile and search for others.
