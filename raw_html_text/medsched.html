                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the long waiting times at the doctor's offices. We were trying to figure out how to speed up the check-in process and give a better service for the patients. Moreover, the app will greatly reduce the number of waste generated with the paperwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows a user to select a clinic they wish to visit and create an appointment on the spot without the help of a middleman. They will be able to see all the available spots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for both the backend. The front end was done in HTML, CSS, Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many issues involving Express.js routes as we did not use a frontend framework. We managed to overcome those issues after several attempts. We also had some variable problems in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall look of the website is quite nice and we are proud of it. We are also extremely proud to have the basics of the application working after many hours of struggle. We have many plans on improving our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how those backend technologies (Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB) can work together. Also, it is interesting to try to build a website without a 'typical' frontend framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedSched
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A check-in option for the patient and an automated queue for the healthcare professional would be a great future implementation. Furthermore, we have considered developing a mobile app since the majority of people own a smartphone.
