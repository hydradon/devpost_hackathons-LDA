                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a website that could truly make a difference in people's lives. So many families are suffering in underdeveloped countries and countries that are at war and many of them are trying to escape the hell that they are living in, but don't have enough money to or the opportunity to. We thought that the best way to help them was to give them a way out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows people to foster families that are denied the civil rights they deserve. Families from the United States will support these families. People can also donate and volunteer by applying on the website. The donations that people make will pay for the travel expenses. If the families that are fostering need extra support, they can a portion of the donations that we give them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using thimble from scratch using HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can into a few bugs when thimble mixed up our two accounts because we were editing on different computers. Also, some of the formatting was confusing. I personally also had trouble finding a way to make the buttons open to a different page on thimble, but eventually, I figured it out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the way our website came out, especially how we were able to manipulate the images and links so when the mouse hovered over them, they would change color. Also, we're proud our idea. We think that if implemented in the real world, it would save a lot of lives.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to time manage more efficiently. At the end, we were in a HUGE rush and were really panicking. I think next time, I'll know to manage my time better. We also became more comfortable with HTML and CSS. I personally have not done HTML or CSS in a long time, so doing this hackathon helped me refresh my skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MOVE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to apply our project to the real world. If we launch the website for real and do advertisements and marketing, we could get investors and people to donate and volunteers, so we would really be able to make our idea come to life. We'd also like to improve and add more elements to our website. We'd like to make our website better organized and cleaner looking. We think it would be real cool if we were able to make this a real company.
