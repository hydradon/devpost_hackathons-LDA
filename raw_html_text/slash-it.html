                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the perspective of "What would i want to do in virtual reality?" I imagined myself holding a samurai sword able to cut through everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a small VR scene where the player holds a sword and is able to cut through given objects, slicing them in half in real time. There are also throwable ninja starts!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using Unity and some 3d modeling softwares such as Blender and maya.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was the heart of our project: how to cut objects in half like slicing through them with a lightsaber. Quite fast we were able to create a cutting plane in 3D and the next challenge was to integrate this to a fixed length sword.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The slicing of objects is incredibly satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with unity and 3d modeling software.

                    What's next for Slash it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the working technology to create an incredibly satisfying experience in virtual reality. Now we want to come up with a perfect idea how to use this opportunity.
