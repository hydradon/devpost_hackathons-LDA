                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team came up with this project while searching for a fintech solution. We concluded that budgeting appeared to be one of the primary concerns among students like ourselves. One of the pain points we drew upon was that it is currently very difficult to log every single expense that occurs. We all have expenses that are shared by a group of friends e.g. ordering pizza for dinner, paying off monthly utilities, etc. Upon this discovery, we noted that there were individual apps for budgeting and individual apps for sharing expenses. Our team sought to make a solution that is capable of providing the benefits of both budgeting and sharing expenses.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitz helps students manage their budgets. Users are able to log all their various expenses. Expenses can be personal or shared. Payments on shared expenses will update the user's budget accordingly. Splitz differentiates itself from other personal finance tools with it's capability to split expenses proportionately as not all shared expenses must be divided equally. Moreover, Splitz provides great analytics and insights on group spending habits which can further help students with budget management.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the work as follows: Dan developed the backend and created our databases using mongoDB. Ridvan and Michael worked together to form the frontend with Python. Albert sketched and designed the structural framework.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major challenges include: database creation, frontend development/GUI design, displaying insights for friends and groups, logic problems involving friends appearing in multiple groups.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifying social problems and how they could be potentially solved, solutions architecture, proper use of Git, integrating the backend with the frontend and ensuring they align

                    What's next for Splitz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Splitz, our team plans to revamp the current UI and create more accessibility for its users by scaling the platform up to a web and mobile app. We would also like to include mobile payments in our solution and allow users to quickly log their expenses. In addition, we are working towards incorporating payments into our solution via Interac e-Transfer. This will allow users to instantaneously pay off shared expenses, further simplifying the budget management process.
