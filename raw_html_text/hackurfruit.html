                    We wondered &ldquo;What&rsquo;s one thing that many people eat on a daily basis?&rdquo;  The answer we came up with was fruit.  Our product is a 3D-printed multi-use fruit peeler to make life easier.  The many uses of HackUrFruit include but are not limited to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    -a circular banana peeler with four blades to slice the outer layer
-an orange/rind peeler
-a dual serrated edge blade to carve kiwis, peel grapefruits, and cut the leafy heads off of strawberries (apples too?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge that we ran into the most for this project was using the actual FreeCAD software.  It would constantly crash on us and give error messages without explanation as to what was wrong.  If there's one thing that we could go back and change from the beginning, it would be using a different modeling program to make our model.  In the end, I'm just happy that we were able to complete it in time.  We literally went up to the wall for the time limit and were unsure if our reprint would be done in time.  Just finishing the project is an accomplishment in itself and I'm proud of what we were able to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point of our product is to reduce the number of things someone has to buy by turning many things with different uses into one thing with all their uses combined.  The design is slim with the thickest part being a quarter inch and the thinnest part getting down to an eighth of an inch.  The portable and compact (efficient? optimized?) design of our product ensures people the best bang for their buck.  It really is the ultimate hack for everyday life.
