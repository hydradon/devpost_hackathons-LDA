                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all interested in applying our skills in web development and programming to education. As MHacks progressed, we also wanted to improve access to quality resources during valuable hackathon minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects a community with collections of courses, tutorials, and other learning resources in order to sort out the highest quality educational materials from all over the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AngularFire to link a Firebase backend with AngularJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of syncing problems with Firebase, but with the help of the Firebase mentors we were able to get past several of these hurdles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a very sleek, beautiful website with most of the features we had set out to create as well as many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a lot about AngularJS, Firebase, and other web technologies. Also about the intensity and sleep-deprivation of a hackathon. But most importantly, we've learned to work as an effective team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MTeach
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MTeach needs a community to create, curate, and filter better and better content. We'd love to be able to expand our reach in order to find those who love learning and give them the best chance to learn.
