                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspirations was a mix between different ideas.  David wanted to write a story and Nick wanted to make an online multiplayer game.  So why not both?!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game allows multiple users to add words to a story.  It ideally should be only one word at a time, but for now each submission is limited by a character limit.  Each user can add to the story.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the webstorm IDE.  Some of our code is from open source tools (cited in code).

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using meteor is new to all of us.  Getting used to it took some time/is taking time. Also, getting our domain registered and using amazon web services proved to be a pain.
