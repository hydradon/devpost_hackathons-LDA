                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I left off with an important tip from an Extra Credits video advising me to design a simple project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player controls a square-shaped emoji with left and right direction as well as a jumping mechanic to traverse through obstacles to hit the red square.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created sprites to build the platforms as well as the player-controlled emoji, whose movements are implemented with c#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a ground-activated jumping mechanic, having the camera follow the avatar's movement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing my first 2D platformer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not to take the project too seriously; allowing myself to enjoy what I have made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Box Hopper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it would be a reference for future 2D action games.
