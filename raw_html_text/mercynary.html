                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mercy from Overwatch. We didn't want the game to about resurrecting the hero. Old school action games
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 2D action game, where you determine the fate of the battlefield by resurrecting dead troops.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game was build with Unity 5 2D and scripted in C#. Game's art was created using Photoshop and Paint Tool SAI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest design challenge was creating a game about conflict where player cannot fight at all. There were some problems with version control, but they were solved pretty quickly. We also realized late that the deadline was so early, so we had to cut many features we had planned. We also decided not to stay up all night and rather get good night's sleep, strongly believing crunching is not the answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with coherent and unique idea. Managing to deliver a working prototype we can be proud of. Having a diverse team where we respected each other's ideas and opinions. We are also proud that we were able to create an art style that was consistent and worked well together.
                </p>

                    We have plans to keep polishing the game and adding features we had planned from the start.
