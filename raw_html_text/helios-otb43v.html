                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you visit a travel booking site today the offerings you can choose from endless connections and destinations. As everybody want to be sure choosing the right trip the planning can cost a lot of patience to fulfill the desire of the most relaxing, most inspiring or most exciting trip. Finally, it is important that you feel well and comfortable where ever you go and arrive and depart with happy emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To give you a memorable and the most sophisticated trip we from Helios evaluate your trip in relation to your emotions. We believe that it is not necessary to know exactly where you go rather than combine what you like with destinations that fulfill your demands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows you to experience a whole new way of travelling. You just need to identify and share your emotions on selected photos as well as share with us your committed budget for your next trip. We than design a tailor-made travel itinerary combined with fashion ideas you will enjoy during your trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a first step the app shows you a variety of occasions and destinations where you as a travel enthusiast will have to show your emotions on each picture. In a next step, you will be asked for a planned budget on your trip so we can calculate the best fitting and most valuable product exclusively for your demand. In a third step, you see the confirmation and the availability of your trip and the confirmation of the hotel matching your emotions. As we want you to relax and be open for something new the destination and the hotel will be done on a blind booking approach where you get the information shortly prior the departure. We believe is that you should start your holiday to get out of your daily routine and surroundings. To offer you the complete service you will have the possibility to order a fashion package to your hotel as well. We will select upon your preferences and if you allow on past purchases and interests well-fitting and beautiful clothes to leverage your holiday to and experience you will get with no one else than HELIOS. At the end of your trip you will have the chance to choose if you want to check out with the clothes or if you want to leave them in the hotel for a small rental fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see a great benefit in offering you the service to deliver clothes you would have bought for your travels anyway with a surprise effect directly to your hotel where you can experience them in an unforgettable way. Together with Stylight we see a huge synergy that they already offer local boutique clothes in touristic places in Europe. This will allow the German traveler for example to discover as well local designer clothes and current hot products.
