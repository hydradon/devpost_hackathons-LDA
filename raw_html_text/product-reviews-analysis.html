                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    help sellers to save time going through reviews and identify key customer insights on their products
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Read customer reviews on a product and identify key topics that the customers talk about and the sentiment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I collected Amazon product reviews data, clean the data, build the topic model and identify the top words in a topic and the sentiment to show users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cleaning the data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify irrelevant topic words and manually remove it
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I figured out that using a tri-gram of text features work best to provide meaningful topic words
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For NLP, it's good to manually analyze the model prediction to see if I can manually adjust the data to help the model learn
                    </li>
                </ol>
