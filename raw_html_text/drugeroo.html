                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a tool that could be applied in the real world and would create a better life quality for pharmacy consumers -which eventually we all will be. We feel the current solutions for delivery of pharmacy goods are not efficient enough. By creating Drugeroo we plan to let people order more comfortably, remove the need to go physically to the pharmacy and save time for all: patients, doctors and pharmacists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is connected to the stock in local pharmacies and can offer customers to refill their prescriptions or purchase new goods. A bike courier takes care of the delivery, and picks up the prescription if necessary. The process is done anonymously for the courier, who never sees both the prescription or the goods, since all is packed outside of his sight.
The user can live-track the courier and see where the process is, as well as an estimate time at all times.
The products are delivered safely to the user, and both the courier and the pharmacy get paid online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imagine 4 different apps syncing between each other in a backend: a patient's, a driver's, a doctor's and a pharmacist's. We decided to build 3 for the demo: the patient's and the doctor and pharmacist's.
The patient's app is an ios app that allows him/her to order products -one at a time for now- and calculate the delivery costs. It also gives the option to pick up the prescription from the doctor, if he is reachable in biking distance, and adds it to the trip.
The patient app can see an simulation of the live tracking of the driver and inform the user of the status of his/her order at all times.
The second part, the frontend, is pretty similar for Pharmacy and Doctor, and it consists in a frontent that gets notifications when the user orders. The doctor can complete the prescription and press "READY" when he has it, and the Pharmacist can prepare the order and do the same. Once both things are done, a driver is assigned and he goes to pick up what he needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thinking of a simple solution that can integrate in very different flows, but has value for all parties was the main challenge. We could make the notifications and communication between the app and the frontend without a backend for the demo, but we still wanted it to be really happening, so that took a lot of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drugeroo really feels like something real and that could be implemented very quickly and in the real world. It doesn't use crazy concepts, and doesn't require learning any skills. With a powerful enough API, it could connect to current systems for doctors or pharmacists and seamlessly integrate. Even if we know the biggest challenges are regulatory and legal matters, we feel the technology is ready to disrupt the pharmacy delivery market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tons of data about Pharmacies in Germany and the health system here! Purchase habits, regulations and laws regarding permissions and medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Drugeroo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully finding a way for something like this to be implemented and allow people to have pharmacy products delivered as fast as possible. We want to enable people to get relief delivered to their door without any problems and wasting time when they are worried or occupied.
