                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're anything like me, you're easily distracted. You fidget, you look everywhere, and your fingers are sore from the constant twitching. Well, here comes the solution: the Distraction Solver 3000, a tool with uses limited only by its battery life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DS3000 has 4 distinct modes.  Upon startup, all LEDs will blink white, until a mode is selected by holding down the button with number matching your desired mode. To exit any mode, simply press all four buttons at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Modes:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Music: Each button plays a short note, that can be held down for a longer note or mixed with other notes for hours of creative fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Color: For a more soothing experience, this simply increments the color of the lights. 2 increases the red value, 3 the green, and 4 the blue. 1 resets the lights to white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Game: For something a bit more challenging, the device will flash a certain color, and the user must press a corresponding button within 1 second. Again, 2 for red, 3 for green, and 4 for blue. The lights flash white if the user has lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Timer: This is a simple timer. Buttons 2 and 4 increment by 60 seconds, plus and minus respectively. Buttons 1 and 3 do the same in 1 second increments. Holding Buttons 1 and 3 simultaneously starts the timer, and it blinks blue when done.
                    <em>
                        Note: Timer mode cannot be exited while the timer is in progress
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought of things I would like to see in a toy or piece of entertainment, and added those to it.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to program in C++, and making a piece of hardware respond to my code.

                    What's next for Table 17- Distraction Solver 3000
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a section to the game that includes a memory tester. Add to the music mode so that the device will remember what was played and play it back on request. Build an external battery/case to ensure portability. Find a way to attach its own WiFi hotspot so it can operate without a set network.
