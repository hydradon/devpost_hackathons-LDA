                    A great challenge
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This weekend was much useful and meaningful. I had great opportunity to work with two languages which I&rsquo;ve listened, but never had encoded it so far. This was an amazing challenge for me because I needed to learn these languages and also I have to do the project. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve tried to do with all encoding with partner in order to not present a dirty code. In addition, I observed that the Golang is very powerful and it&rsquo;s a backend plataform which I&lsquo;m going to keep studying and also doing a specialization. Although, I didn&rsquo;t have a good adaptation of the react native, probably because the lack of documents. In my opinion, even so this language be very promissory, it&rsquo;s not so mature yet. Indeed, where I&rsquo;ve had more difficult in this project was to do a login with Facebook, because I was trying to use a Facebook&rsquo;s library react-native-fbsdk and I thought the documentation a bit failure. Since I not had enough time to learn fully these languages, I had a lot of fun with this project and I&rsquo;m very grateful to see the product working well. The IOS project was not done because I didn&rsquo;t have a computer to execute the X code.
