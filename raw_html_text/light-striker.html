                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our passion for the Arduino, we decided on using the Arduino because it structures an intuitive environment for both hardware and software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple carnival game, where the user tries to apply as much force on a pressure sensor. The result of this is a LED matrix, displaying the amount of strength the user applied.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of the Arduino IDE and the UNO, we were able to use various hardware to compliment the game. We had a MAX7219 LED matrix displaying the output. A 16x2 LCD display to tell the user any information that is needed. Furthermore, we had a pressure sensor to measure the input from the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we initially started, we had some problems getting the correct libraries to operate the LED matrix. As a result, we lost some time and were not able to complete all the features that we wanted to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the number of things we learned in such a small time. We had a lot of exposure to multiple hardware components that we were not too familiar or comfortable with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some of us, this was the first time using the LED matrix. Although it was a challenge, it was a great experience learning how to operate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Light-Striker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a rotary encoder so we are able to change the difficulty of the game. Moreover, we want to properly make a case for the game and add some other aesthetics to it.
