                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are you not in engineering? Do you have the bittersweet luxury of making your own schedule? Our inspiration comes from the frustration we had making our schedules last summer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    cuScheduling is a local server-hosted program that allows you to input the courses you're taking, and presents you with the best time table(s) that fit the bill!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazingly we were able to divide the project into 3 separate projects that seamlessly worked together on the first try. Just kidding. Although we were able to divide the code into a front end interface, data webscraping, and back end data processing all in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use new modules and services on the fly. We made use of flask, mechanicalsoup, urllib, requests, and a few new tricks we had to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning all the new API's and experimenting with new languages. The webscraping and Flask web server creation was particularly enjoyable. While we're not certain it will replace CU Learn yet, we are still very proud.
                </p>
