                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea simply occurred to me during brainstorming, and it seemed the best idea so I went with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can go around the map to find items and use those to set traps, and lie to others to cause them to run into those traps, or hope they run into them by themselves.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I determined what I wanted to create first, and followed that plan, cutting when necessary or adding if I had time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I occasionally would run into bugs that I couldn't seem to figure out, such as implementing a fog of war or spawning an item in the scene.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Solving all my bugs and implementing my core features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create a game, modify it, as well as how to code it up.
