                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At one of the previous companies we worked at, they had a slack bot called "nostalgiabot" that was used to remember funny and memorable things that anyone at the company said. When we missed people who had left the company or just wanted to hear funny quotes that a person said we'd ask the bot to remind us of that person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memory Jane (MJ) lets you store, organize and view the memories you've shared with your loved ones. Whether it be a song, a video, a photo or even just something that they said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tech stack was fairly simple. We built it using flutter, a UIKit for building natively compiled application for iOS, Android and the web. We used firebase to store all our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to do a lot documentation reading as well as searching online to figure out how to work with our tech stack as we'd never used any of the software prior to this weekend. Setting up tools to compile cross-platform apps is often a hassle especially because the team used different operating systems for development as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having put a fully functional MVP together. This hackathon was very impromptu and last minute and we didn't really have any idea of what we planned to build or whether we'd even stay through the entire hackathon to build something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the process of going from core human needs such as to remember and to be remembered, to building something that taps into that need and adds value. Be it mixtapes or screenshots, we want to compile memories in an ocean of chaos and we learned how to build that idea into a reality through technologies we hadn't even used prior to the hackathon. We learned the promise that cross-platform frameworks like flutter offer as well as the power of packages to avoid having to reinvent the wheel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memory Jane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enable voice input to allow for simpler interaction with commands such as "Remember that Johnny said ....." and "Remind me of Johnny". Automatically compile different memories into a short video based on some kind of user heuristics. Tighter integration with third party agents and apps, as well as extensions such as Chrome would make it even more easier to connect with the app and preserve memories.
