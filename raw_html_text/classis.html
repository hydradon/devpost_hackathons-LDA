                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found SIS very frustrating to use, so we wanted to simplify it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClasSIS allows one to select classes and put it onto their schedule by clicking on the classes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on coding with Angular, HTML, CSS, and TS in order to develop the aesthetic and functional features of the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was creating an interface which adapted and followed user input/interaction.  We were able to overcome some aspects of this dilemma.  However, there are some elements that remain not completely resolved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing a formatting method to display the classes.  We also learned a lot about Angular, HTML, CSS, and TS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Angular, HTML, CSS, and TS programming.  As well as how interactive websites systems are developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ClasSIS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we intend to implement the entire Lou's list set of courses into the system and also add a better UI for the service we plan to provide.
