                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roboy needs to be as human as possible to be accepted as the amicable robot he is. This incudes the ability to quote cool movie lines and emote according to situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quoboy is a addon for roboy's text analyzer to say movie quotes and famous dialogs in popular culture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by extending Roboy's ROS face module and Dialog manager. A new text analyzer is added to detect some keywords for movies and initiate an action to ROS face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges while integrating the dialog manager to the ROS face service. ROS bridge connection had issues.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete the entire scope we planned within the hackathon timeframe and we are very proud of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Connect with Open Movie Database API to randomly pick quotes
Memory based emotive actions like remembering Birthdays and greeting
Coupling with face detection to trigger the memory based emotive actions
