                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When coming up with ideas we often came up with a seemingly great idea, only to see that it had already been done. Sometimes, we would end up developing a product only for a few days before seeing that a duplicate project had been made. So, we decided to come up with an easy way to find out whether our idea had been done before. This can also be used to find inspiration for a project related to certain subjects like global warming, ocean acidification,etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches up an idea on many platforms including Github, CrunchBase, Devpost, and United States Patent and Trademark Office.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python and hosted a server on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to read the JSON we got from our queries and to format it into an easily readable format for our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a working application in half the time of regular hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding services and how to get JSON for patents, GIthub, Devpost, and Crunchbase.

                    What's next for Competition Spotter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to integrate other search services and better our search function to be more accurate.
