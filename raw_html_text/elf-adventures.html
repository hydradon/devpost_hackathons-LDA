                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game similar to other games we have played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The character must traverse through a landscape filled with spikes and turret shooters. You have lives, and lose when all of them are gone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at the functionality of sample games, and attempted to reproduce it in our own game.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                        Teamwork
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had very little experience using Unity, but we were still able to create a viable game.

We would like to add more levels.
