                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At one point, one of our group members had spent some time building props for a theater program. We starting talking about this, and decided that we would try to expand on that experience by building a "magical" sword!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sentient being trapped deep within the heart of the sword senses its motion and lights up in joy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a sword base from wood and 3D-printed pieces, then attached an LED strip and an accelerometer to an Arduino Uno. When the accelerometer senses motion greater than a certain baseline amount, the LEDs light up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to resolder a lot of wires in order to get the LEDs to light up, and had a lot of trouble getting a motion sensor to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a beginner team, so we are incredibly proud that we managed to put together a complete project over the course of this hackathon. We came into it just hoping to learn a few things about hardware and hacking, but accomplishing as much as we have has been amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much everything we did for this project we had to learn from scratch. We learned how to write basic arduino code, soldering, 3D-printing, basic woodworking, wiring, and using a breadboard and motion sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Iridescent Tones
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to incorporate sound and other inputs in order to enhance the display. We would also like to improve the overall design and make it portable.
