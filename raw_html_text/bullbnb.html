                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired this web app was how tedious planning the most cost efficient vacation is. We have to search through so many different flights and Air BnB bookings, but it's still hard to find the best deal. We wanted to streamline this process.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BullBnB will accept: where you want to go or when you want to vacation, or a combination of the two. It will look at all the Air BnB options and give you a list of where and when is the best deal.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web app using flask. We chose flask because it was simple to get started and didn't require a lot of new knowledge. We also wanted out back-end to be in python since we were familiar mostly with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was going to be this with flights and Air BnB, but flight APIs are only accessible thought requested keys, usually for business use. So we had to scrap that part and just do the Air BnB portion. Towards the end of writing the back-end though, we put too many requests to the Air BnB API we were using and were not able to have a functional back-end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Very proud of all the work we put in and what came out of it even thought we had some major changed in the middle.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use flask on a basic level and to not trust APIs as much as I thought I could
                </p>

                    What's next for BullBnB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is to have a working back-end and to incorporate flight data as well.
