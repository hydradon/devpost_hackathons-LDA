                <p>
                    Sites like hackthissite, overthewire, and smashthestack and a lack of social engineering based wargames or wargame sites.

                <p>
                    A website hosting multiple self-contained hacking wargame style challenges or challenge sets. Each designed to teach various concepts and methods used in social engineering and to raise awareness in the recognition of when social engineering is being used. (Currently a work in progress but planning on developing long term outside of this hackathon). The intended audience is high school and up.

                        Current games: recon &amp; dialogue and social engineering capture the flag.

                                Recon &amp; Dialogue - The player will go through a simulation of gaining access to the online bank account of a fictional character named Alexander Coleman. Will consist of 4 parts:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Finding a username from one of the social media sites of the mark.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Gathering key information on the mark such as likes, dislikes, residence, the schools they attended, etc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Actually interacting with person. This will be done through dialogue trees.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Combing all of the info gained from steps 1-3 and logging into the mark's bank account through a password reset answering a security question.
                                    </li>

                                Social Engineering CTF - The player must call someone, strike up a conversation, and get the person to answer questions from a provided list. Will have multiple lists at different challenge levels.
                            </li>
