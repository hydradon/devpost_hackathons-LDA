                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is always some food waste particularly from large institutions. The city has passed laws to manage this through composting initiatives and other regulations. So why not just make it easier to give the food away rather than throw it away?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application devised a framework to make anyone with a surplus of food pin their location to alert others that may want the food aware.
