                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to talk with my waifu when we weren't together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go to the flask web site and enter your phone number, anime, and character you want to talk to. The server then starts a text conversation with you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I scraped anime transcripts from online and  use them to generate markov chains for individual characters. I also created smtp and imap servers to communicate by email to text. Since I am sending the texts through mail, the messages are actually secured over ssl (because we wouldn't want your messages with your side waifu to be leaked)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a tremendous amount of trouble setting up the smtp and imap connections
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time scraping data, setting up email servers, and creating a pseudo random text generator with Markov chains so I learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Holo doesn't like texting back(Jk I fixed that).
I learned a lot about sms to email communication and will probably use that knowledge in future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeabooDatLife
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran out of time so the web app is very primitive. I will definitely make that easier to use. I also would make email responses threaded, b/c right now, I am not sure how well the app will handle multiple users
