                    WEmentor was founded in 2018 to provide a peer mentoring platform for all self identify females throughout their college experience. Our primary goal is to create a community of females from all STEM majors and culivate friendships while providing additional guidance as you navigate through your major. This is done by providing a platform where freshmen and sophmores can be paired with juniors and seniors within a university who would like to volunteer as a mentor. Our platform allows you to view fellow females' profile within your major, send chat requests, schedule meetups to help blossom meaningful mentee and mentor relationships.
