                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created MediSend as a way to help people who may forget to take their medications and who need to keep track of whether or not they're taking them on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MediSend is a chatbot that will take in information about what medications you take and it will send a reminder to your phone when the medicine is scheduled. Then it will allow the user to record if they took the medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Twilio and Python to create the chatbot and API to send a message to the user's phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was my lack of experience in Twilio and having to learn on my feet. I'm incredibly proud of my final project, despite the hours I spent searching for error messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to have a final project that is functional and that I had the confidence to work on the project by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about HTTPS and different errors that happen if you're not familiar with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medi-Send
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to improve the way users can access MediSend and incorporate a doctor/caregiver application to allow more accurate tracking of medication use and if the medication is effective in lessening symptoms.
