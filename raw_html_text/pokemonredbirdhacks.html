                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    20 year anniversary celebration dedicated toward this spectacular game. We wanted to challenge ourselves to see if we can learn a new language as well as create a new application comprising a team with different sets of skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to open up Apple maps and simulate encountering and catching pokemon. Users have different choices as to whether they want to try their luck on catching, attempt to lure with bait, aggravate or flee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Swift in Xcode designed for iOS9 beta.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were populating the pokedex by passing parameters between different view controllers and having views switch based on different actions that the AI performed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Animations, staying motivated the whole time, team bonding, and creating a functional game in an entirely new language!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can imagine a function, sprite, animation, or design; we CAN implement it. Nothing is impossible.
                </p>
