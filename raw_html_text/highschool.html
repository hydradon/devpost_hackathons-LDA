                    Problem description:
Schools are over-crowded , A lack of involvement from parents , lack of standard communication between instructors (teachers) and students, unreliable Data Systems, New Learning Models
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why solve the problem:
from early childhood through college and workforce students and instructors (teachers) don&rsquo;t adopt common data definition including easy to fetch data, competent demonstration of student mastery of content on their own pace is not encouraged, In the current schooling landscape, there just isn&rsquo;t time for large amounts of group projects and problem-solving exercises, parents are unable to monitor their children progress as education is concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What to do to solve the problem:
With the use of technology teachers can share content, distribute problem solving exercise, and manage communication with students, colleagues, and parents. Use technology to create personalized, competency-based learning environments that allow students to demonstrate mastery of content at their own pace. Where parents can currently take the mantle from time-stricken teachers and offer some fun on-demand knowledge to their children. Adoption of common data definitions across K-20 education systems. Conclusively all the afore mention solution will be integrated in a web application
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we solve the problem:
My team chooses to solve this problem using a web application, this application is a platform that encourages the integration of technology in education sector (teachers can share content, distribute problem solving exercise, and manage communication with students, colleagues, and parents). Using the html, css, bootstrap javascript for the user interface and the object oriented SQL with php for the back end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    System accomplishment feasibility:
Since developments of web applications comes in milestones , I and my team is happy to inform you that the student and instructor(teacher) section of the application has been realized while the parent and will be available for the user testing stage on the .tech domain and the forum section will be completed just 2 weeks after the hackhathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reason for naijahacks intervention (what we need from teamnaijahacks):
As our application will be coming as a freeware platform, we need the naijahacks backing and help to make publicity on software, if possible provide sponsor that can finance us on some current and future expenses. As loyalty we show.
