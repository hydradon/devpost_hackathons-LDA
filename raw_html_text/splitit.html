                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's a classic scenario: you're having a nice night with the friends and order a pizza. Next thing you know, everyone's scratching their heads trying to calculate who owes who how much, and dollar bills are flying about. Here's an app that does all the hard work for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a group based IOU app that tracks inventory. It can be applied in the home when splitting groceries or the classroom while managing supplies. Your user profile will keep a log of who owes you and how much you owe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app through Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working to create a basic visual interface through Java. Working a slow emulator. Managing layouts, getting elements to appear on the screen, basic UI elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an Android app! Doing something!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we are not good at Java. Fundamental skills in app development. Managing dynamic elements accross activities. Creating a database with SQLite and manipulating it using queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SplitIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will expand the database to allow for a more flexible formation of groups, user profiles, and inventory. Basically, a lot of backend.
