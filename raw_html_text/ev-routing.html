                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is that Greg has an electric vehicle and he cannot road trip with it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to enter their current mile range and maximum mile range for their vehicle along with a destination. After some load time, the app displays the route to the user. The user can click a button to open the route in a navigation app on their phone such as google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a cross-platform experience so we decided to use flutter, but the Esri API does not have a flutter mapping library. We decided to use the Esri rest API to get our route planned and then used Google Maps to display the route to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating EV charging stations along the route is expensive and it takes a while if the distance is large. The google maps flutter API is also incomplete so the documentation was nonexistent.
                </p>
