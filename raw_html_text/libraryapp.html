                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here at the University of Florida many times we go to the libraries looking for a place to study, but during peak hours this proves to be an almost impossible task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In theory, the app would allow the user to sign in with his credentials, select from a list of local libraries, select his classes and express if he/she is available to study. Then the app would make a query searching for students that have also signed in into the app, letting the user know how full the library is and how many students are willing to study for his specific class.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was our lack of experience with Android-Studio. Despite having learned Java and been familiar with it, developing mobile applications is quite different.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of trying to work on the app we learned from a myriad of workshops and were introduced new concepts like Agile and Lean software development, Digital Product Design, and others. We also experimented with Virtual Reality and learned some basics of the Unity engine.
