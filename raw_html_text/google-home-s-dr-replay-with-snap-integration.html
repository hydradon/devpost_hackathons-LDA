                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In deliveration for building a skill for the Google Home with practical day to day application, we settled with this design for the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can record with a buffer space of 15 minutes, the last conversations that happened around the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the platform and a raspberry pi, we decided to integrate the two to provide an asynchronous integration of the replay feature outside the Google home device. The Google home provides a REST integration.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Many, including utilizing an appropriate microphone for the raspberry pi.

                <p>
                    We managed to create a test Google home skill and also more about team building skills.

                    What we learned
