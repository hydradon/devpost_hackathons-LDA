                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facilitate / Enable the Image processing features of Photoshop in UIPath
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Application Connector FIPS enables some image manipulations of Photoshop such as spatial rendering, cropping, decorating with text to generate a new photo with new decorated appearance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exploiting the capacity of UIPath we interact with the Photoshop CS6 to develop the targeted feature
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully imitating the humain interaction with Photoshop GUI element to render a photo according to a predefined template with placeholders to be filled with information (image, texts)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Mastering the virtues of UIPath, we succeeded in manipulating Photoshop application to format an image according to a predefined template
Optimizing the interaction with Photoshop GUI element to perform the formatting task precisely with UIPath addressing methods
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Daring to use UIPath for developing more complicate automation process.
Deeply digging inside to the addressing methods of UIPath to locate Web objects and interact with them
                </p>

                    What's next for RIPS: Reformating Image with PhotoShop CS6
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend FIPS with some other sophisticate image processing features of Photoshop like 3D text rendering , Image restoration / improvement.
Incorporating the Artificial Intelligence in Image processing to add some semantic analysis on the contents of images.
