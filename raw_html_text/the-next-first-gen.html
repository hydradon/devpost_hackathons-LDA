                <p>
                    We are driven by a strong passion to close the opportunity gap in access and affordability to higher education opportunities for all students, especially those who are first-generation, low-income, underserved, and underrepresented.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the survey with a web page and form using WordPress and Contact Form 7. After the data is collected from students, it is downloaded from the database as a csv file and analyzed in R, resulting in valuable insights on how to improve the education system to better serve minority groups.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to decide on which data to collect, how to collect it (as well as clean and format it), and how to best analyze it to solve a problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Next (First) Gen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, as more surveys are completed and more data is collected, we can make stronger insights about minority educational opportunities (ex: compare between locations or between schools). We plan to create interactive charts, graphs, figures, maps, and other visualizations for users to better understand the data we've collected.
