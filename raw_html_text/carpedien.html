                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asian Carp are an invasive species of fish that are known to eat essentially anything else that swims. This poses a threat to native species of fish and the ecosystems and economies that depend on them.  Successfully preventing the Asian Carp from spreading involves predicting where and when they will spawn. The measures scientist are interested in compiling are the following
                </p>
                <p>
                    Number of days the stream water temperature is above a certain threshold
The length of the stream
The velocity of the stream

                    Our Four Goals:
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Compile and maintain a database of past stream data that would be relevant to predicting the spawning of Asian carp.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use real time web communication to update that database each time the platform is used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preform model calculations on the database to predict where Asian carp are likely to spawn
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Construct an user experience that is easy to use and yet allows a researcher full access to the data and metrics being used to create predictions
                    </li>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS was used to create API to collect data and apply the Model provided in the problem statement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data from USGA is esoteric and difficult to collect
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dispite a diverse skill set and experience levels that ranged fro into to computer science to 15 years in the industry, the dedication, talent, and teamwork was amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After learning about the topic, collecting the data, and applying the model, we are proud of the platform we developed and believe that this product provides much needed access to data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea there were so many ways to measure a stream. :-/

                <p>
                    Get input from researchers on how this product can be improved and used. Create a user interface to further ease access.  We are please with the success of this development and look forward to developing it further.
