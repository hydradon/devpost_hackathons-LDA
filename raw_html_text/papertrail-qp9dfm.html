                </h2>
                <p>
                    Normally, it's difficult to fill a day in an unfamiliar city with interesting attractions, events, and dinner plans, but it shouldn't be!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can look for events somewhere online -- but there are so many places to look. You can get a paper and pen out and try to plan out a day, but it's a pain sorting out travel time, finding when venues open and close, and fitting time for dinner at a good new restaurant in between! And we've all put together a plan, only to find that it's way outside of our budget. Why go through that process alone? Enter PaperTrail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Papertrail's an app that helps you or a group of friends plan how to spend a day in a new place. It takes your location, and suggests sights to see, places to eat, and things to do, putting together suggested schedules for your day. Take a look, pick a day plan that suits your interests, make some changes, and be on your way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PaperTrail uses the Bing Maps API to find points of interest near you. After checking schedules for movies, estimated travel times, and the highest-rated attractions, it suggests possible schedules for your day. Pick a suggestion that sounds interesting to you, and add or remove events you'd like to change. Then, you'll have a complete itinerary, map, and schedule of new and exciting things to do!
