                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Australian drivers have hard time to find a vacant parking spot all the time, so we are here to reduce the difficulties of searching available parking spot and automate parking process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our MVP, user can use our mobile application to search available parking spots within user defined range. While user is parking their car, the parking spot can automatically recognise user&rsquo;s car plate number. The user get to choose which online payment method their want to use and how long their want to park their car there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Car plate number recognition is implemented by using Raspberry Pi with camera and computer vision algorithm. React-Native is be used to implement our mobile application, our back end server is implemented by Django framework and sqlite as database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HardWare:
Car plate recognition.
BackEnd:
smoothly communicate with front end and hardware part
Interchange information between front end and hardware part
Front end: 
Balance between UI design and performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated front end, back end and hardware end smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An idea is only worth as much as it&rsquo;s implementation
Prioritizing is the number one priority
Don&rsquo;t get attached to any of your previous decisions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Parzi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QR code scanning feature would be implemented to easily spread and implement our product at the beginning stage. Basically it one unique QR code would be printed in the park slot that allow user scan and pay after they are parked. Afterward, camera detection feature would be largely used to completely automate the process.  If we can deploy our system all over Australia, we can help Australians find cheap and close spot to park their car, we can automate whole car parking process,  we can potentially tracking any car that did pay the parking ticket automatically without a ranger.
