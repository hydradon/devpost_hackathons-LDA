                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SlapStick, the idea or the inspiration behind this could be none other than my friends who were so frustated to find cartoons especially 90's cartoons to watch for free and they had to download from torrent sites and these cartoons and comedy from the 90's made me nostalgic and that's where the idea was taken to the next stage
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple Comedy . It does the simple work of entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. Nostalgic ? or In need for some laughter you can just search your favorite 90's cartoons, 00's cartoons, youtube channels , vines ,pranks, stand-up comedy and much more. Effortless youtube streaming

                <h2>
                    Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the android app with the android SDK and the language that we used is JAVA (so obvious and so old ) and the new KOTLIN for the effortless youtube streaming we used none other than youtube android player api ( Still not obvious ?) .We used the famous library of picasso in our project which I should have replaced it with Glide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes getting the playlist was a hard task when there are so many copyrighted videos and some videos are not even allowed to play on other websites or application. So we decided to solve this problem by taking the playlist way.
We knew we wanted to display all the videos from a particular channel and we thought why not use the playlist id from the top and use it in our app and that solved the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly I couldn't find a complete app which gave so many videos together except big companies like Amazon , netflix , hotstar . We decided not to ask anyone but take from youtube and we did just that.
