                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halo 3 ODST
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ODST drops an advance care package from space than can supply natural disasters hit areas with Wi-Fi, and basic survival materials such as food (MRIs), blankets, and water which will be delivered to humanity via a network of drones charged and placed in the drop package.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A heavy amount of our time went into researching and developing the ideas behind our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working against time, especially for 3D printing. Due to other teams also wanting to use the aerospace engineer's lab's 3D printer, we had to wait hours for our 3D printed parts to finish printing.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our payload box! We spent 3 hours working on measurements, and cutting and sanding wood to build our payload box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since national disaster recovery calls for government involvement, we discovered and used Homeland Security's National Incident Management System (NIMS) to organize and allocate jobs and resources during aid and restoration. In working to build a network for our relief drones to interact on the ground once released, we found out that an ad hoc network can be built for the drone system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ODCR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be working towards designing and building a model satellite, payload, drone communication system, and GPS system. Our goal is to combine our knowledge of rockets and drones to add to the current research on space exploration, space travel, and disaster relief.
