                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current news include many ethical issues in the world, and we believe one of them is to do with the transparency of the products' information. As brands become more global, the supply chain and the manufacturing process becomes more difficult to understand for the consumers. As an inspiration, we thought it would be suitable to integrate TODAQ's BBB challenge with the existing ethical problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a problem in the jewelry industry that consumers and marketers do not know the behind the scenes of the making of diamonds. It is said that Tiffany &amp; Co. is one of the only companies that has announced the jewelries' origins. 
Our application increases the transparency of the manufacturing and shipping process of diamonds. We use the blockchain in order to pass onto information from miners, refiners, designers, manufacturers, billing managers, and shipping managers to consumers. With one file, including the information of its origin and who has contributed to designing the jewelry, consumers will easily access the authenticity of the jewelries from one file.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using TODAQ API in the start point, we made sure that transaction from one checkpoint to another in the process of making jewelry more transparent.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all had no experience with backend programming, and we faces many challenges with coding in JavaScript, which we are beginners at. In addition, it was our first time implementing API's to our project. Another challenge we ran into was the gap in our ideal image of the application and how we implement the application. It seemed implementable to do a blockchain for the first time as we have listened to speakers from TODAQ and Luno. However, we ended up only making the basis of the application with lots of complications in the process.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all had no experience in programming in JavaScript (especially the backend), implementing more complicated API, and using IDE for JavaScript. As we are a team of first year students, we are aware of the fundamental data structures from the lectures and workshops, but it was really our first time with hands-on coding for implementation of APIs. We are proud that by taking the example of TODAQ, we were able to make something that works on our scenario. We also made it through 24 hours with completely something new, which was exciting for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a lot of knowledge on APIs, JavaScript, backend programming and functional programming as well as the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain. We have heard and listened to talks about blockchain and cryptocurrency. However, we had no experience in using them as a solution to a problem. We may not be the closest to solving one's potential problem, but we think we grew as student computer scientists.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Diamond Blockchain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diamond Blockchain aims to optimize and decrease friction in the manufacturing process of diamonds, and what we have done in this 24 hours was the very basis of brand to consumer communication using a file. We believe that the next step for us is to connect more people in the supply chain such as refiners, designers, miners and warehouse managers. There is a potential in our idea because using this blockchain, we make the process more transparent for the brand and the consumers, considering its ethical integrity.
