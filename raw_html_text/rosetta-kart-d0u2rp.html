                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new language can be difficult, especially for character-based languages, where you have to build up a large number of associations between symbols and meaning. Rosetta Kart gameifies learning Mandarin using the Bose Frame wireless headset!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Bose Frame has off-ear speakers, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer. The Rosetta Kart game has the player drive down a track while the Bose Frame reads out English words. The player then steers the Kart by tilting their head, which is picked up by the Frame. The goal is to steer the Kart towards the correct gate labeled with the Chinese character associated to the dictated English phrase.
The game builds a direct association between English meaning and Chinese characters, reinforced by visuals of the object in the environment surrounding the road (for example, a dumpling shop appears on the side of the road when 饺子 is dictated!). This Demo showcases a lesson on Chinese foods such as dumplings and fried rice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilize the Bose AR SDK with the game-engine Unity to implement this project. The Bose Frame is a sleek tool that takes a different approach to AR &ndash; audio first. When learning a new language, it is incredibly useful to take advantage of sight as well as sound for deep and effective learning, a task that the Bose Frame is uniquely suited for!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Bose Frame is a fairly new device with very little online resources or notes from the community, so debugging was especially difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The applications online of the Bose Frame are mostly recreational, so we were excited to figure out a pedagogical application for the product. We feel that language learning is an application that really takes advantage of the device's features, and on top of that the project gameifies the learning process.
Also, none of us are experts in Unity, and none of us have used a Bose Wearable device before, so it was exciting to be able to put this project together in just 24 hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for Rosetta Kart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game structure is very versatile. Any words may be dictated with the accompanying characters and even visuals on the side. For more well-rounded learning, the game can also be switched to dictate in Mandarin and have the gates labeled with English words, Pinyin, or even pictures. This game can be extended to other languages, or even other subjects one might wish to teach! We would like the build a back-end that allows us to quickly build other lessons.
