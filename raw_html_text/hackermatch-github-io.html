                    This is a website where hackers attending hackathons can register to be matched up with potential teammates based on their interests and goals.  The Python back-end pulls information from a Google Sheet that is automatically updated by the Google Form registration form. Then, the matching algorithm intelligently matches up web and app developers to a team so that there is a good ratio of front-end and back-end developers.  This ensures that each team is balanced with regard to members' skills.  Each registered individual is then able to view information about their team members by inputting their email on the website's "Your Team" page.
