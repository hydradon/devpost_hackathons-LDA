                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love going to the gym, but we don't always have someone to go with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It links gym goers in the same university by suggesting people with the same availabilities and interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode, swift, and firebase as out database.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User authentication using firebase was a challenge. Also, Swift was a new language to us. We also ran into github problembs.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new language and how to integrate a working database in our IOS app. We also learned how to use XCode's UI model.
