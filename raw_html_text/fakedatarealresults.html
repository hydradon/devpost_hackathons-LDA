                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to compete in DAIR's Data analysis challenge. We were asked to use data analysis to help users make data based decisions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates risk profiles of applicants to help determine who should be admitted and who should get financial aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with python, generating random factors for every applicant and then determining the risk of admitting that applicant based on those factors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were provided almost no guidelines or data to work with, as well as the sponsors of the challenge not being available.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I completed everything I originally set out to do.

                <h2>

                    How to create risk profiles.

                <p>
                    Full automation of the admission process, depending on how many applicants are needed and how much financial aid is available. Also including other factors that may be important.
