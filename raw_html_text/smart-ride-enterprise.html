                    t is a mobile application that promotes and facilitates car pool practice. Users that drive a car are able to publish their route and time of departure to work. Co-workers that are looking for a ride can search for published routes and register to them specifying the pick up location. Driver would accept co-workers requests and the application would inform about the Estimated time of pick up. 
The application service is limited to companies or events for security reasons. Every company registered to the service would run a dedicated instance of the application.
