                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students and office employees experience back pain due to sitting and slouching for long hours at a desk.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    SITRIGHT is a smart sensor pad that can attach to any computer chair to track sitting habits and overall improve posture. The pressure sensors on the pad will vibrate to notify the user to adjust their posture or to take a scheduled break from sitting.
