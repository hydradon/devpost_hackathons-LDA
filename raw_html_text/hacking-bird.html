                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was to be able to include individuals who are visually challenged into the great world of gaming. We all know how great of an experience it is to play video games and we wanted to bring a similar kind of feeling to those who cannot experience it normally through sight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, this application was inspired by the famous game "Flappy Bird" and it is an accessible version of it. In order to make it playable for the visually challenged, we decided to substitute the main visual points of the game, into audible ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using the programming language Python and a library in Python called pygame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many design issues because the concept was one that none of us have ever attempted to tackle prior to this hackathon. Thus we spent lots of time brainstorming in order to come up with the best approach to accomplish this goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was proud of our team for accomplishing what we set out to do which was to make this great game accessible to more individuals who may not have the luxury of having eyesight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this project, we learned how to embrace differences and how to create a product that can be used not by just one group, but by many. We learned that if we have a desire to help others feel the joy of gaming, we could make it happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacking Bird
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to perfect this app in order to make it seamless and accessible at the same time. We want to use some sort of external indicators through the form of sensors in order to make the game feel even more immersive to the visually imapired.
