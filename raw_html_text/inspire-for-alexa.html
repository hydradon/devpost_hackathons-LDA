                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the new innovations in personal companions, the team was inspired to provide an experience that would truly improve the lives of those who Alexa interacts with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa uses a custom built skill called "Inspire" that allows her to respond to a number of queries to help inspire and relax you.  Currently, Alexa can play soothing sounds, recite an inspirational quote from a database of 40, and can engage the user in calming breathing exercises.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using S3 and Lambda provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the team created a custom Skill written in JavaScript that allows the user to query Alexa with multiple different intents, prompting an appropriate response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, the syntax and hierarchy of organization, as well as the setup of AWS and Lambda was confusing and hard to pick up.  Additionally, the differences in existing demos made it hard to zero in on a style of design for the code and flow of the conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this hack with no knowledge of how Alexa worked, and very little experience in JavaScript, the team is very proud of overcoming the challenges and developing a working skill that makes interacting with Alexa all that move valuable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program new skills for Alexa, as well as how the system picks up on different intents, making the conversation flow more smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inspire for Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, the team wants to extend the different tasks that Alexa can preform in the Inspire skill so that it can make a genuine impact on the lives of those around her.
