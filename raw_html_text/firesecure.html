                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In an emergency, the safety of the rescue team members is equally important. With a device like this, it gives first responders a heads-up and warning of what they are going into before putting themselves at a potentially high risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot sends real-time video streaming of the environment from the webcam. It also sends data from the sensors attached to the mount including the temperature, air quality, and the distance from a fire source, alerting users when conditions are hazardous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By combining the Dragonboard 410c to an external webcam and incorporating the SparkFun RedBot board, the bot is able to accomplish all the above functions via wired connection. Wood frames were laser cut and used to mount the motors, wheels, and circuitry to complete the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was getting the Dragonboard 410c to connect to the internet and provide real-time livestreaming from the webcam to the computer monitor. Wireless controllers required further knowledge and time so we decided to run it directly connected to the computer instead of transmitting data via bluetooth to the boards.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Dragonboard 410c to stream live video to the internet. Displaying data values from the sensors in a clear, sensical, and informative way to tell users exactly what is needed. Creating a functioning vehicle body with limited resources.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about linux and how IP configurations work. We also learned how to read data from sensors and put it into human readable format with the redboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FireSecure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get away from the developmental stage, we intend to make our bot wireless and be able to send the sensor data via internet or bluetooth connection. It is also possible to expand into not only terrain vehicles but to drones and other mobile machines.
