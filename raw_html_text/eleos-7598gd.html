                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In times of hardships, generosity is needed in order to overcome barriers, and with technology connecting the world, helping someone should be simple. Though technology is readily available, information regarding different not-for-profits can be less apparent, as someone may be interested in a cause, but unsure which of the many organizations they should donate to. Additionally, some people may want to help others, but are unable due to current financial situations, and thus feels powerless and inferior. Therefore, there lies a need for a convenient manner to utilize the innate compassion that we possess as a society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eleos is a website that compiles a list of not-for-profits that partakes in this service, allows not-for-profits to show all the work they&rsquo;ve accomplished and wish to accomplish in a more transparent manner, and allows users to watch ads/complete surveys in exchange to donating to their interested causes. This takes advantage of current Google ads and various survey platforms, as companies are always looking to promote and analyze their branding and are willing to pay in exchange for this information. 
 ## How I built it 
This was built using Google Firebase and Firestore to store user&rsquo;s data, Google Maps and Radar.io to locate not-for-profits in close proximity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front end design of the website. Challenges that occurred during this process include having to learn new software development tools that required lots of experimental processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have built a website that gives everyone the opportunity to help others and the environment by lending just a few moments of their time. We are proud that we were able to integrate different software that we were not familiar with to create a cohesive product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for Eleos include pairing the system with the Google ads and survey systems and establishing bonds with not-for-profits to create a comprehensive list of different organizations currently available and the work they do.
