                    What never failed to both disturb yet entertain us? Dark humor. We each agreed on incorporating dark humor in our game characters. We felt that it added more dimension and realism to them when completing tasks. Since there are four of us, we each developed our own mythical worlds to create a fantasy centered game. Each world comprises a task. The game initially starts with an empty village with one individual, and the playing character is the single survivor. The character must complete the challenges provided in the different realms before discovering the cause of the wipe out. Dark humor comprises taboo, yet real topics. And in a game of death, it seemed like an enlightening feature, yet also a triggering one to add greater effects of player interaction in the game.
