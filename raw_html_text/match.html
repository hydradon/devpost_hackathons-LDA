                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to help old age people who live alone when they are in an emergency. This application makes it simpler for them to call a hospital when they don&rsquo;t have anyone nearby. It also help take the inconveniences out of a complex app. It is also for people travelling in locations they are not familiar with and need urgent medical attention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app utilizes the geocoder class and the Location Listener to get the current location of the device. It then gets the current Postal Address of your location and finds, from a Hospital Database the closest hospital from your current location. It then gets the Phone Number of the Hospital from the Database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in Android Studio. I used the geocoder class and the location listener. I also created a pseudo database for the Hospital Data because the actual data base was 1200 bucks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to find that using excel files and accessing and manipulating them in java and android studio is really annoying. The only way to go about it was to use jxl API but using that would have added unnecessary bulk to the code. So in the end we just csv file and not an excel file to increase performance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time participating in a hackathon and the first time working with Android Studio from the scratch up so we are mostly proud of getting the job done. We are also proud of doing something meaningful for the greater benefit of the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is hard to work with excel files in Android or Java in general and that sometimes we have rework our approach to get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MATCh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting more features like instead of calling a hospital, maybe alert two or three closest people when under threat or when needing someone's assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, using an actual database rather than manually creating one is our next step.
