                    Sponsors are often scouting for talent at Hackathons, but it can be hard to identify jobseekers and their skills. HackathonJobs simplifies the process by allowing sponsors to see who at the hackathon is looking for work, and what their skills are.

                    Sponsors can meet jobseekers who are attending hackathons they have sponsored, and arrange to chat with them on the day.
