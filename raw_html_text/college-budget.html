                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my own difficulty to make a budget and stick to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application helps you estimate your budget. You answer a couple of basic questions about your life style and we provide you with a suggested monthly budget. You can then create your final budget and manage it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java and XML. The estimation is based on data found on university websites. I used the average monthly budget for college students in Canada. Based on it and on your answers, the application automatically adjusts and estimates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't quite sure of how to represent my data and manipulate it the most efficiently. I ended up choosing HashTables and ArrayLists. I also wanted to do too much for only 36 hours so I had to restrict my ambition. I am still working on saving the activity state and restoring it for the budget management part. I was also interested in taking the estimation result and outputing it in the budget management activity but I got stuck on how to transfer this data from one activity to another. One solution would be to make the destination activity extend the initial one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of the design. I think it looks good and is fairly intuitive to use. I am also proud that my estimation activity works well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton of Java and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Budget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the overall user experience and maybe use a learning algorithm to improve estimations. I would also like to make my Budget Manager activity way more complete. (I was limited by time)
