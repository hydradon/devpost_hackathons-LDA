                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're like us, you hate standing in line. Do you ever wish you could talk to the person at the front of the lunch line and ask them to order you an extra chicken sandwich?  Now you can with skip. Next time, skip the lunch line!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say you are in a long line or about to enter a long line. What if the person at the head of the line could just order for you so you'd get what you want sooner? Skip is an app that lets you do just that. And for the people doing all the work of waiting in line and ordering food, they get a little bonus cash from the guy or gal who'd rather not wait in line. It's a win-win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the power of Google Cloud Services and web development know-how, we were able to gather new techniques in order to bring our idea to life. We made use of ionic for the primary part of the front end and used python along with all the Google Cloud goodies for the backend. In order to make the app scalable, we utilized Kubernetes which will ensure smooth operation no matter how many users are active on the service. Also, we couldn't have done it without GitHub!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was simply designing the user interface. After sketching up a design we got to implementing it using ionic. However, the most difficult part was making the front end information available to the server.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to work together in a team that was formed of new friends found at the hackathon! We are also proud to be working on an idea which seemed to resonate well with many people, especially within our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it&rsquo;s important to iron out the technical details that surround the project before attempting to execute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for skip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many future features that our team feels Skip will benefit greatly from. Such as: location based suggestions, a messaging system, user accounts, etc. Also, collaboration with restaurants for simply scanning a QR code to place you in a line.
