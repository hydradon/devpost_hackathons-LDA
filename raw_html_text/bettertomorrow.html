                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make different component of the website due to different reasoning. I made the financial page for my friend who have a hard time staying away from retail shopping. I made the recycling page for those who are like me who are ignorant of how carefully recyling has to be done. And finally I made the mental health page from my own experience of having panic attacks and trying to cope with it.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    <strong>
                        Better finance
                    </strong>
                    -Uses google custom search api to limit search results from google for under specified limit. it also does not allow advertisements so people are not going down an endless rabbit hole of retail therapy.
                    <strong>
                        Better finance
                    </strong>
                    -Is a simple HTML game that helps people understand basic recycling and what goes into what bin.
                    <strong>
                        Better mental health

                    -Is for people who are having a panic attack. It has various component so that since solution to panic attacks are not one size fits all.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, Javascript, CSS for the website structure. PHP for the contact page and google custom search API for the search engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My initial plan was to do a web scrap to find different prices of online items and build a database that limit the appearance of that. I was unable to do so due to time restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very happy with how the website turned out so far in such short notice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though I was not able to implement web scrap, I was able to learn a lot about it and would love to implement it in the next hackathon.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will try to make an actual game from the recycling page instead of an HTML one.
