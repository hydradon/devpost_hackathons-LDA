                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were little, we were fascinated about animal and loved learning more about them. Now that we are older and have the expertise to build an Alexa app, we want to find a way to allow kids to develop their passion for animals while having fun and learning with a simple quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Animal Guess Game
                    </strong>
                    is a simple quiz game to help children associate animal name with their sound. After entering the quiz, users can guess the sound of an animal. There is also an information mode where users can ask the app what sound does a certain animal make. With this app, children can easily familiarize themselves with animal sound while learning more and entertaining themselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the build-in interface on developer Amazon Alexa to develop the VUI. The backend is hosted on AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa only recognize words in the English dictionary. Therefore, we had to come up with creative ways to imitate the sound of animals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to overcome the limitations of Alexa, including how Alexa&rsquo;s vocabulary is limited and how speech recognition is not exact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Alexa skills and how they work in general. We also learned how to use the interface in developer Amazon for Alexa and how to host lambda functions on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Animal BUZZ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more animal data and diversity the animals. We also hope to improve the voice interaction so children can have more natural conversations.
