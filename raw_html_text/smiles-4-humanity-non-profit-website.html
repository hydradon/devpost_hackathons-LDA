                    Inspiration: We were inspired by recent trips to visit family and areas where we had never been, specifically in Pakistan and India.
                </h2>

                <h2>
                    How we built it: We built a website using free software from Weebly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We ran into design issues, especially when converting to a mobile site; however, we were able to reformat the website and circumvent the issues.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We are proud of the social implications that this project gives, especially considering how there are actual issues that have the capacity to be solved using this kind of initiative.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to create a website (on a basic level) along with how to use different web development software like Wix and Weebly. We also learned the importance of teamwork; if not for the efforts of each of the four team members, this project would not be near what it is now.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smiles 4 Humanity non-profit website: We might consider taking this to a real-world level, in which through school areas and other, larger non-profits, we can actually impact lives worldwide.
