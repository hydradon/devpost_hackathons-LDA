                    The purpose of this blog is to help remove any misconceptions of human trafficking as well as educate young adults about the true horrors of sex trafficking. Due to the increase use of social media, information can be quickly spread through the click of a button. As a team, we believe that spreading such information will erase any misconceptions of this terrible &ldquo;industry&rdquo; and spread awareness to students, thus creating more awareness and help for victims of sex trafficking.
