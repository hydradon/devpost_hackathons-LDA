                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we did not have any Internet of Things Devices, nor a plan with us when we entered SB Hacks III (we wanted to do a VR/AR project), the unique opportunity presented by the Bluemix software suite from IBM was too much to resist. Like a conductor in an orchestra, we believed that it was what tied all the devices in an IoT ecosystem that would truly create a Smart Home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SUNSHINEoT is a Bluemix/IoT cloud based software that communicates with the user's smart phone to learn the patterns and habits of the user so the home may be ready for the user in the morning, whether this means turning on the lights, heating up the house, or even brewing a fresh cup of coffee just as they get into the kitchen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is broken up into three parts. First, is the mobile clock, which lets the cloud know when the user is awake, as well as passing on data from the calendar in case there is an event which would require that the user wake up earlier, not by sound, but slowly activating the world around them. Then, the cloud begins to activate the IoT ecosystem, learning patterns from the user to tailor the experience. Finally, there is an iPad app to simulate the IoT ecosystem, "activating" when the cloud tells it to and passing on data when the user makes an input.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between mobile platforms and the cloud, we found documentation sparse, especially with iOS Swift, resulting in over 25 hours of research to get communications up and running.
