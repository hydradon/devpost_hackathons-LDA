                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be looking for jobs soon, and felt the need to understand what was happening on the back end of websites that are similar to the one we have created.

                    This app allows users to register and log in, where they will have a dashboard. This dashboard is the main section that holds an overview of the information for all the jobs in the area.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask framework along with Python. We then used Heroku which allows us to host our website online. (For Free)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Flask and Postgresql became a big challenge since we have never used these modules before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that getting the Postgresql to work properly along with a Heroku Database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about querying databases and creating a website in general. We learned how to migrate our knowledge of SQL over to Postgresql. We learned how to the flask framework to route the user to different pages, as well as format data from queries to our html pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlaskApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want the interface to provide more information on the user, and allow for employers to be able to add their open positions to our website.
