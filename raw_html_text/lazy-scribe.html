                <p>
                    College is hard. No matter which university you attend, students struggle with juggling various activities on top of school. As a result, we may not be as attentive as we would like when the professor is lecturing in the classroom. Some schools are starting to record lecture videos, but we observed that it was very time consuming to go through an entire video if we only want to watch the part about a specific topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    Lazy Scribe enable students to precisely search lecture videos by keyword. It's an app that students can download into their laptops, which most of them already carry to lecture halls. During lecture, they run the app which records the video, in the backend, we are converting the speech to text and by the time the lecture is over, the students will be able to search the video by a specific word.

                    We plan to implement a summary function to convert all of the notes taken into a more concise format. We also plan to use the wealth of video data to create an immersive 3D environment so that our tool can better engage our students and enhance their desire to learn.
