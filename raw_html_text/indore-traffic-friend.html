                        What it does:-

                        How I built it:-

                    <em>
                        Challenges I ran into:-
                    </em>
                    Initially it is hard to decide what to build which actually help user to assist in traffic related decisions but then I&ldquo;Indore Traffic Friend&rdquo; concept comes into mind. This application is under continues development. Phase I development is already done. Phase II development contains lots of features which requires hard mathematical calculations and image processing features as well as some features requires us to collaborate with traffic department which currently seems to be challenge to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of:-
                    </em>
                    Phase I is successfully done and output is high performance Android application. Phase II is started and we got success in lane detection upto 50% this is one of the biggest achievements in this application.
                </p>

                    <em>
                        What I learned:-
                    </em>
                    Leaning is always part of development. While developing we came up with many rules related to traffic which help us to understand how we can help ourself by following all those rules.
                </p>
