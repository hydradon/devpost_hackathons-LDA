                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember those childhood (or adult) moments spent acting as the captain of a fleet of boats, slyly hiding your boats from your enemy among the squares of a 10x10 grid?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don&rsquo;t. So we decided to make a virtual one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Battleboat is the game you&rsquo;ve always dreamed of playing, but never had the chance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Battleboat is the perfect combination of both a vocal and visual game environment. You as a user play against AI in an attempt to stop your five-boat fleet from becoming ocean-bottom debris. The user simply initiates a game with a simple &ldquo;Ask Battleboat&rdquo; and is then prompted by AI to place their boats. After the user has successfully (or unsuccessfully) hidden their boats, the AI will initiate the most exciting part of the game: guessing where the enemy boats are.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Battleboat took advantage Amazon Alexa voice recognition and the companion app&rsquo;s use of home cards. We did this by creating a custom Alexa skill, AWS Lambda function, and Amazon ASK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is comprised of one person with limited (hackathon) JavaScript experience, and three people with none at all. Nonetheless, we created an app written entirely in JS that implements Alexa skills, AWS Lamdba function, AI, and a visual representation of a continuously changing game board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud we were able to accomplish our goals of combining vocal recognition and a visual display. Additionally, we are extremely proud of our multi-dimensional implementations of a competitor AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest goal with Battleboat was integrating both a vocal and visual experience. We wanted to create a game that intuitively combined the voice capabilities of Amazon Alexa and its companion application&rsquo;s home cards display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Battleboat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to extend beyond a single user experience with AI and make it possible 
for two users to play against one another.
