                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four students who love history, when we came across the opportunity to create a virtual reality project we wanted to take full advantage of the opportunity. We hoped the user would become completely immersed within the experience of being in a World War I tank and essentially travel back in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simulator places the user within a historically accurate World War Mark IV tank. The user is able to enter the simulation and experience using the levers, dials, and the different mechanisms within the tank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the simulation by using C# and Unity. This process heavily involved the modeling of numerous tank components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the key components of the tank is the intricate engine. In order to provide the user with a historically accurate experience we had to attempt to model the complex machinery. The engine provided various challenges such as being as accurate as possible with every intricate design and making sure the engine itself vibrated similar to the Mark IV engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first year students who came into computer science and the hackathon with very little experience, we did not expect to be capable of creating any project. However, we are very proud of what we learned in a such short span of time including: Unity, C#, and building complex models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though SD Hacks 2017 we learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and being ambitious in what we deem we are capable of doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World War I Tank Virtual Reality Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to implement additional features such as difficulty levels and interaction with the opposition.
