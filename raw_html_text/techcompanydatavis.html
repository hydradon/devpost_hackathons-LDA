                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted people to understand the market data with their eye and ears more quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays daily market values of multiple companies from 2005 to 2015. If the market value increased/decreased, the cube in the virtual environment will also change its size accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a little bit of R and excel to align and normalize the market data of companies. Then, the analyzed data was feeded into Unity. Using JavaScript, we changes the size of the cubes in relation to the market value changes.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had successfully connected LEAP to control the music&amp;data simulataneously, but all sudden it broke down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to show data in a virtual environment and implemented LEAP to manuveur the objects in the environment.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need more time

                    More data, better data vis, and fix LEAP.
