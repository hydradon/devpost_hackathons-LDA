                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was looking at memes on the Texas A&amp;M meme group, when someone posted "please describe Texas A&amp;M in 5 words." A word cloud was then made from that. It was a really good reflection of what students thought about the university.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is just a word-cloud, except it updates live. People can send texts to it and it will conglomerate the most common phrases. Sentiment analysis also sorts the phrases by color, and there is also a profanity filter. The installation can be placed in a high-traffic area to show everyone what the students think about the university at any given time. And, since it is anonymous, it encourages diversity and freedom of thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python &amp; Flask for backend, and JS for frontend. Texts are received via Twilio API. The enclosure was built with wood and various supplies from Home Depot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying server, getting Twilio to work, getting python to work, issues with connectivity, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We built everything in ~6 hours. (yes, the enclosure too)
