                    Special caution is required where we have young children and the elderly. Children are naturally interested in sparks and their curiosity could lead to serious accidents. Whether they happen in school or at home, intentionally or unintentionally, fires set by children are always cause for concern. 
    Most school counselors will, at some point in their careers, be called on to work with a child who has started a fire or played with fire.
Even experienced counselors may worry about their ability to help a child who has set fires, believing that highly specialized skills are required. 
In our experience, it is commonly believed that fire involvement is rare and that it is always a sign of serious psychological issues.
Facebook believes Augmented Reality will meet a broad set of fundamental user needs in rich and powerful new ways, eventually becoming the dominant computing platform. When AR is fully realized, people will explore the world, express themselves and be happy.
That is why we have brought a solution to fire accidents by providing caution to children through SparkAR. We plan on working on more effect that saves lives... We are team SparkCaution
