                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was partly inspired by Pokemon Go, which makes you go around a local area in search of objects. The game was adapted to a mobile version so you can go out and experience it for yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app generates a random item to look for in the city and you have to take a picture of the said item. Then the image is sent to an API called Clarifai that will identify the image by adding tags to it. The tags are then parsed for a tag of the said item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project was built in Eclipse Android SDK. We split up into two groups, one group was tasked with working with Clarifai and the other was tasked with working on the user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had initially planned to use Google Maps API as well to verify the location of the person when they take the picture, but we decided to scrap the idea because it was unsupported by the Eclipse Android SDK. The next problem we ran into was with the Clarifai API and we were stuck on the problem for most of the hackathon until a few hours before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface was completed so we have a complete user interface. We are also glad that we were able to solve the problem with Clarifai near the end of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Android App development and working with APIs. We also learned that you should do extensive research on the APIs you plan to use beforehand in order to avoid problems.
                </p>

                    Implementing Google Apps API and using the Camera to upload the recently uploaded photos to imagur and then pass the image from imagur to the Clarifai API.
