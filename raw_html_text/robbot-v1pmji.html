                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How do you stop harassment in a community? Blocking users or limiting network access is not a permanent solution and often does not work because there is a way to get around it. The only way to stop harassment would be to hold those accountable for the comments that they post online. This is why we developed RobBot.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RobBot is a smart Twitter bot developed to fend off online harassment. It scans twitter feed in your area, looking for harassing tweets and calls people out on it. Which means if you post a harassing comment, you will receive a retweet from RobBot telling you that you made a harassing comment. The harassing comment and the user's information are stored in a database, to which the admin can do what they wish with the data.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The back end was developed with Javascript using Node.js, twit api, and twitter's api.

                    Deployment of the website or web hosting was a big problem so we are deciding to demo on the local host.
