                    How does it work?
SAM consists of two devices, a wearable band and your smartphone. You have to download the SAM app on your phone to connect it to the band.
This wearable device makes use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to build your personality. It collects your personal data (with your permission) from social media apps such as Instagram, Facebook etc. If you do not wish to share your personal data with the app, you can chat with the chatbot present on the app. It will have a set of predefined questions to help it understand you better. 
Once you start using the band, you can start recording conversations and making SAM a part of your conversation. Once you press record, it will start listening to your conversation. This will help SAM understand your personality better. It will learn about your discomforts and help you with those awkward or difficult situations.
