                    This application was mostly inspired by our want to make a web based application that integrates an API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this application, a user will be able to enter credit card information and a dollar amount, then through a secure server call, that amount of money will be charged to their account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was built based on react. We used Stripe, which is a payment API, to make secure calls between the server and the user. Additionally, we had to create our own server using the Google Cloud platform to run the app on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a team of 3 sophomores without much experience. During this hackathon, we learned a great deal about integrating APIs and how servers function. Also, we were able to expand our web development styling skills.
