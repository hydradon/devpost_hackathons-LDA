                        The Myo Flight Simulator
                    </strong>
                    was the brain child of too many sensors and too little sleep. The team wanted to take advantage of the Myo Armband's powerful array of sensors to add a new perspective to an already established task or procedure, so we began interfacing with it's data and surveying the various fields we could apply it to.

                    The Myo Flight Simulator is simply a control interface for Google Earth's flight simulator that uses hand gestures to adjust the orientation of a plane. Used in combination with the Oculus Rift, it creates a totally novel way of interacting with flight simulators.

                <p>
                    Our control interface was developed primarily in Python, using a library of bindings to interact with Myo's C-based API. It then uses keystrokes to interact with Google Earth in an admittedly hack-y, yet surprisingly effective way.

                    The biggest challenge we ran into was interacting with our flight simulator at a high level. It has no built-in method for interaction, and it would've been significantly more difficult to develop an entirely original flight simulator simply for greater control, so we were forced to compromise and simulate key commands to interact rudimentarily with Google Earth.

                <p>
                    We're proud of our control interface, not because it will revolutionize the world or generate millions on the market, but because it gave us an excellent excuse to play with Google Earth for hours.

                    There's not much next for the Myo Flight Simulator, but the team we created while building this project was priceless, and we can't wait to come up with something new.
