                <h2>
                    Our Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by making rough sketches and brainstorming ideas for the problem identified.
Following that, we began to scope out project and thought about things like
                    <em>
                        Who is the target audience?
What are their needs? 
What design elements can best address those needs?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By making wireframes and user flows, we came up with a final design idea that we all agreed upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After picking the color scheme and logo, we divided the work such that each of us designed hi-fidelity screens for one user flow whilst taking feedback from everyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final step was to sit together and combine all the different user flows, addressing design language inconsistencies and making the final touches. The result is a fully-functional prototype! :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaborating on a project is never easy but it doesn't get harder than four designers trying to work on the same design at the same time. It was difficult not to get stuck on every little detail but we powered through and helped each other along the way -- by giving feedback when solicited and taking regular breaks :P
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! And we are proud that our project solves multiple problems at the same time. Every feature has been thought out from the user's point of view and addresses a need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it looks and feels pretty damn cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is possible to design a complete app in a couple of days. We learned that we work better when we allow room for everyone's opinion. We learned that feedback is what improves a product so it's silly to get attached and caught up in one design feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it was Mahitha's first hackathon ever and she had a lot of fun :)

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prototype was designed in the context of a university. We think it can be extended as a community building solution for any organization. We plan on completing this design, testing it with users and iterating to make it better.
