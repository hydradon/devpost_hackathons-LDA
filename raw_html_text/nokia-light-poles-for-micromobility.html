                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electric Scooters are heavily problematic, for both users and the operating companies. Users suffer from low-charge vehicles, and scooters that are left in the middle of the street. Operators suffer from high personnel costs related to charging, and vandalism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilize the future network of Nokia LuxTurrim5G poles to create a network of charging stations for e-scooters. We show how a handshake protocol between the scooter and the pole can be established, and used for billing the relevant e-scooter operator for electricity used. Additionally the pole can function as surveillance for possible vandalism or theft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial viability concept based on known industry data points. Proof of concept for handshake made with RaspPi emulating exchange and charging with possibility for usage tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 person team meant a balance of technical / product, but lack of manpower to create any substantial tech demo.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participating and putting our best to create an unique solution with highly potential business case.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Joakim - Using sketch as design tool with SVGs. Learned more about current problems with NBIoT &amp; 5G. Very hard to find quick implementable uses for 5G stations.
Markku - Using Raspberry Pi with multiple external libraries, setting up static network, creating sockets and handling the connections. Learnt a lot about 5G and MEC possibilities while researching for the project subject.
