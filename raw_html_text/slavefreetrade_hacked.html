                    We were inspired to use blockchain technology in order to address issues of slave labor and poor working conditions in many supply chains in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created smart contracts for managing worksites and the individual relationships between employers and employees. Every payment is stored in an immutable public ledger, and verified by individual users. This makes the tracking of working conditions public and permanent. Those who refuse to adopt the technology can be boycotted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there is still some possibility of fraud by employers, this public ledger produces a wealth of data. Using a sample set of data, we demonstrate a classification machine learning algorithm is able to take information from the public ledger and determine whether or not a work-site may potentially be fraudulent.
