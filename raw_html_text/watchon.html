                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally this was going to be a project about tracking crowds using a multi-node IR system. We maintained the multi-node aspect of it, and transitioned to trying to track a single person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenCV is used for blob tracking on two Lepton cameras. If all goes according to plan, one node will tell the other node to start searching for a person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the image processing to work was very challenging because there are a lot of weird data type incompatibilities and scaling issues. We also hit a lot of bugs at the last minute with the network cutting out on us and such.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the robot is able to follow a person's heat signature that is a huge accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about image processing, about GPIO on the Raspberry Pi, and about running socket servers in node.js and in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WatchOn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More nodes and crowd tracking for larger events. It seems like the multi node system doesn't really work right now, oh well.
