                    Inspiration - Our inspiration was learning how to design an app
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - tracks sleeping patterns and generates custom schedules to improve the amount of sleep a teen gets
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - we designed the app and its basic functions in Adobe XD
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - starting off the app design and figuring out a way to present our idea
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - the way that the app came out (including its design and the way it functions)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - how to turn an idea into a product that we can present to an audience
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sleep Solution - since the app is mainly focused around teens as of now, it would be a high priority in the future to make the app suitable for adults, too
