                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relevant related news stories can be difficult to obtain on the average news website. We wanted a better way to visualize the world news and how each story was related to the others through time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application shows suggested news related news stories in time to the one the user is looking at. It displays a short blurb of each article, a main article picture and visually compares other news stories in time to the one the user is looking at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using d3 java, html, css3 and processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members have a background in coding, and we had to use d3 to accomplish our goal, which took a real concerted effort to learn something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first moment our application returned a result we knew it had all been time well spent. There were trials and we moved through them, we didn't let setbacks or a previous lack of knowledge prevent us from completing out dream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to try and try again, learning is the persistence of a dream, and we realized that dream this weekend. We came in with an idea and no real idea how to make it, and together we figured worked until we got it.

                    What's next for TWOFOLD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all in the same program at school, and as of now would like to continue working on the product.
