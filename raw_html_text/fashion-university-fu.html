                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's kind of like a tinder for fashion, where your friends or other people can tell you what they think about your outfit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used xcode do develop the app in swift 3, along with google firebase which held our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of knowledge in app development, and we only had two people in our group, so lack of manpower
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    competing in our first hackathon, and hopefully being able to submit a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a good amount of swift code, and UI development, and database management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fashion University (FU)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we would like to improve it so we could make it more appealing to use, and eventually make an android version of the app
