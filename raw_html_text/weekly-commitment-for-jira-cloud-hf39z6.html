                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we're trying to find motivation inside ourselves, but usually it's much easier to ask somebody to help our motivation. That is why we engage fitness-trainers and coaches in our life. The same thing is with software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to have more motivation, just promise your colleagues to do something during the week and review the results on Friday. 
Weekly Commitment add-on provides you the simplest way to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The add-on allows you to mark any JIRA issue as your commitment. This way you promise your colleagues to resolve it until the end of the week. You can create a few commitments and use 'My commitments' page in order not to forget about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every project member can see 'Weekly commitments' page within the project to understand who made commitments on which issues. The same page is great to maintain Friday retrospective meeting with your team, to understand if all commitments were fulfilled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every commitment can be in one of the following states:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        BLUE &ndash; Week in a progress. You have time to resolve the issue
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GREEN &ndash; You've resolved the issue during the week you've made commitment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        RED &ndash; Week passed, but you haven't resolved the issue yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        YELLOW &ndash; You've resolved the issue but not in time.
                    </li>
