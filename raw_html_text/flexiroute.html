                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -The inspiration for the project was inspired by a few ideas and goals of each team member based on work  and research experience as well as first-hand experience. The idea to create a central hub that not only aggregates multiple routing data sources that are not normally linked together (such as driving a to a bike location and then cycling), but creates routes optimized for individuals users based on their personal preferences is a novel and exciting endeavor. Furthermore, route selection is usually done without users being fully knowledgeable of the consequences or how other routes may offer other scenarios that may be potentially beneficial to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flexiroute is a mobile phone application that offers users the option to search for alternate routes (other than the traditional routes that Google would produce) with respect to the user's input of multiple preferences that personally cater to each individual user. The application offers a range of preferences - cost, time, health, and safety - that can impact route optimization on a user-defined scale of importance for each preference. This flexibility allows for the user to find a route that best suits the user's needs or desires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and programmed the application in java. The application accesses multiple data sources from the list provided for the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -SmarterRoads was used to access yearly crash data as well as toll pricing on I-66. 
-WMATA API was used to access bus and metro routing and fares.
-Google API was used to find alternatives using different modes of transportation and road segments that would bring the user to their destination. 
-Open Street Maps was used as a reference and source for locating bikeshare and parking locations.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Data filing in the directories is at times difficult to access via code based on the path is was stored in.

                    <li>
                        Figuring out what some values in differing data sources meant or referred to led to some time consuming moments
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        README.txt files or code snippets of APIs consuming the data would prove really useful in understanding how the data is intended to be understood.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Building an application that takes into account multiple preferences and builds its routes dynamically based on these inputs is a rather novel idea while remaining useful and intuitive, especially in areas such at NoVa where the transportation systems are very robust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We were exposed to a lot of familiar data in formats that may weren't as familiar, and thus learned how to use it more efficiently. 
-We learned how so much of this data, familiar or not, can provide very unique and beneficial alternatives for accomplishing tasks that users may not have been able to before. 
-This was our first hackathon experience as a team and individually, and we learned a lot about how much can be done with a lot of dedication and a little bit of time.
                </p>

                    What's next for FlexiRoute
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Crowd-sourcing preferred routes from local or knowledgeable commuters to come up with a foundation of knowledge to provide more optimal and personalized routing options. 
-Provide users with suggestions that rely on possible past routing preferences for similar routes or past routes taken.
-Include more datasets such as Lyft/Uber, disability information, and vulnerable road user datasets.
