                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way for people to have more of an incentive to work out. We&rsquo;ve learned through our Pfizer friends that their company, and other like minded companies, are beginning to ofter incentives for people who go out and exercise. This system is hard to manage and companies often have to design their own organizational system. These two ideas allowed us to create: StepScores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StepScores is a companion website to the fitbit. Fitbit come with a unique code. Every user will sign up, create an account, and sync their individual fitbit to their account to make sure multiple people cannot use the same fitbit. If a fitbit is lost or someone buys another one, all they must do is change the fitbit code on their account information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the average person uses StepScores, they synchronize their fitbit and create an account. Using fittest own software, we made it so every single day the fitbit will automatically update the information on the website. Fitbit keeps track of all information on their app/website, and we merely use data from fitbit for the individual. Each person can track total steps, daily steps, weekly steps, and yearly steps (along with the averages of each). They can also see graphs of the aforementioned data, and if used for more than a month can see their improvements made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website allows companies, nationwide, to post prizes and incentives to people for working out. For instance, Starbucks may want to offer a free small coffee to people who, on average, walk 5000 steps a day for 5 days straight. Our website automatically calculates this data. There will be a list of prizes and incentives offered by each company. The prizes will be ordered by the number of steps needed, and companies can offer weekly, daily, or yearly prizes. This list of prizes will show you where you are in accordance with how far you are to completing your goal and being able to redeem your prize. If you like, you can filter prizes based on categories: food, entertainment, or clothing. Every day you can only redeem one daily prize and every week one weekly prize. On the other hand, every year: you can actually unlock all yearly prizes you qualify for. We are incentivizing this country to go out and walk or run, making steps and exercise a form of currency. Most fitbits sold are not worn regularly.  Based on data collected, there are approximately 10 million fitbits used every day by people who want to work out and get in shape. This number is growing rapidly with almost 1 billion dollars in revenue in the last year. Also, fitbits are generally purchased solely with the reason of working out, unlike say an apple watch which people do not use sole for exercise, and unlike a fitbit, is easily tricked into recording additional steps. Thus, this website is not targeted to people who have no desire to work out. But, people who want to work out, and may want an additional incentive(most everyone who wishes to ever work out) will want to connect their fitbit to this website. Rewarding people for working out, incentivizing exercise, and giving people a stronger reason to all work out is a great solution to many health problems in our country. But wait, there&rsquo;s more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies want healthy employees. Companies will pay MONEY to promote a healthier lifestyle for their employees. Companies like Pfizer give money back on insurance payments based off of fitbit performance. Organizations, with more than 10 people, will pay our company a fee. What we will do is, create a system that keeps track of all people associated inside the company that have a fitbit. When a company makes a group they send a code to their employees and employees update their account and join the group using the company code. They still keep track of all their steps, see all their data and graphs, and are able to redeem all prizes as before. However, now, companies will have a self updating list that tells them the highest performing employees and most improved employees(that have made true improvements starting with at least 500 steps a day to minimize a null or zero start value or a very insignificant improvement of a small number inflating an improvement percentage). Individuals can see their rankings but not their fellow employees. Also, since companies will want to offer incentives based on performances. On the user's home screen, next to the list of coupons and discounts will be a list of the incentives each company offers based on performance, what one needs in order to get the incentive, and the list, like the national coupon list everyone will see, will highlight where you stand in regards to each incentive and how far away you are from achieving your goals. It also will, as before and as with the larger coupon reward system, show you total steps, daily steps, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    If users wish, in the future, after setting up an account they can be updated once they have reached a certain goal and thus achieved certain prizes. Or they may wish to be alerted when they are close to a certain prize. They may want to know if in a certain day they are only 100 steps away from a free dessert per say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have sign ups for both organization leaders, and individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website allows people to keep track of their steps and allows certain organizations to provide incentives to their employees, and other companies to provide incentives and coupons to the general populace in order to encourage a healthier lifestyle. Companies will want to do this to both get people in the door, get free advertisements, and promote healthier living.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Javascript, Flask, PHP, CSS, Fitbit API, Google charts, photoshop, Ruby on Rails, and Java.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble figuring out how to compute the steps necessary for the reward system with regards to the self updating data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, we really like our idea, and our website. We like our design, and how the graph self updates averages that are automatically inputted from fitbit data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us have never used flask and we have had to learn. That was a rewarding experience as we used it to make self authenticating email verification to create a username that when paired with a fitbit automatically collects data and creates a user profile. We like how it is extremely easy for the user and they do not have to do much, confirm an email really, before this awesome website is completely set up for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StepScores
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Market the idea, add a new email authentication service for companies to send verification codes to employees, figure out how to accept continuous money from companies and store data in sql tables. One thing we may want to change is make it so that long time frame prizes can be set up differently. Currently we have it so that one can claim the weekly prize of 7000 steps during the week just by doing 1000 steps on average for the whole week. Some companies may want to make sure that in order to unlock a prize the person must do a minimum number of steps during each day, so that employees maintain a more consistent rate of exercise. So in this case, company X may want the person to have to walk a minimum of 1000 steps every day, which totals to be 7000 in the entire week, but make sure the person takes requisite steps every single day.
