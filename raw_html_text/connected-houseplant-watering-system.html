                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it easier to both travel and properly care for our houseplants
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps four different types of plants watered, and allows you to check on their soil moisture and set the desired soil moisture from anywhere with an internet connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the Elecrow Arduino Plant Watering System, added an ESP-8266 module to connect it to WiFi and make HTTP requests to publish sensor data and, then built a web platform to store that data and revise the setpoints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned to use a serial bridge to a Particle Photon to get the data to the cloud.  This turned out to be unreliable, so we turned to the ESP-8266 to connect to the web.  None of our team was familiar with this hardware, however, which made it a major time drain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite running into setbacks, we did get the system to the point it was being controlled remotely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't underestimate the challenge of embedded code and hardware setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connected houseplant watering system
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot that could be done.  Immediate needs are more robust control, better logic on the hardware, cable &amp; appearance improvements (a case, waterproofing).  Eventually, historical data &amp; visualization, perhaps an upgrade to a system that could be provisioned, perhaps visual monitoring data.
