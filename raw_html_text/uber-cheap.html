                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ended up spending a lot of money on Uber and noticed that uber gives different fare estimates for very small difference in the point of booking. So, I came up with a way to help me save money on uber.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app gets you the cheapest possible uber fare estimate in a place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cant request a ride through the platform to test it since I haven't paid for the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used RapidAPI to connect with UberAPI. I built the front end in AngularJS which communicates with the REST service written in Sails JS. The app is deployed in Carina docker containers by Rackspace. Also, wrote an Alexa custom skill to ask Alexa to request an Uber through the app rather than the actual Uber app. Alexa communicates with the AWS Lambda function which makes a call to my service. Also used Google GeoCoding API through RapidAPI to get the Lat Long values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uber API was struggle to work with. Lot of issues with it. And they rate limited me. I had to come up with work-arounds to circumvent that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was able to deploy everything to Docker containers. I also worked on a chat bot to enable booking an UberCheap through chat messaging through my service. Don't think I will be able to finish that before deadline. But it was a good learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use AWS Lambda functions with Alexa. How to deploy containers in Carina. How to write a chatbot.
APIs used: Google GeoCodingAPI, UberAPI, TwilioAPI. All APIs accessed through RapidAPI.

                    What's next for Uber Cheap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Write a blog post about it so other developers and friends can benefit from this. Probably write  a better wrapper and documentation around the Uber API.
