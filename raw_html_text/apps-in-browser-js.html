                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dropbox for apps. Apps-in-Browser.js runs applications in your browser through an operating system written in Javascript. You can then share the same instance of that app with a unique URL and have your friend start off where you left off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The operating system is based on the open source OS.js project. We implemented a noVNC client to stream content to your browser window and simulate the feel of a real desktop application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenging part was understanding the VNC protocol and hacking it to work with the browser and a contained program (since we didn't want to spawn a bunch of VMs for 10 different applications).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad to have pulled it through even though the majority of the project was spent on the small details, and we almost gave up multiple times throughout the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The smallest problems are often the most frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Apps-in-Browser.js
                </h2>

                    Making it into a service (and open sourcing it). This would be useful to run portable versions of a sandboxed game that a dev wants to put out. This way people don't have to install the game to play a demo version.

                <p>
                    Another useful feature would be building a Sublime Text/ iTerm clone using web technologies so that you could send your team instances of your code and work off the same desktop environment.
