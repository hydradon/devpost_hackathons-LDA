                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was a child, my friends and I would always have a fascination with dinosaurs. Many of the other kids my age would also be interested in learning about these majestic yet giant creatures that once roamed the face of the Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill is extremely simple to use. All the user needs to say is, "Alexa, tell me about dinosaurs" (among other variant phrases), and Alexa will respond with a child-friendly fact about dinosaurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the skill through the Alexa Developer Console and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I have created a skill that I wish I had in the past when growing up as a child.
