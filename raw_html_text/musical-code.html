                        Get an objective to solve.

                    <li>
                        Start solving it in any language of your choice. You have five minutes to do this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get someone else's code, and continue it. You have three minutes to do this. NOTE: You are allowed to change any existing code, and even restart it in a different language if you wish, but keep in mind that you have a limited amount of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat step 3 until a piece of code has been solved.

                    <li>
                        The first person to complete a piece of code wins.

                    <li>
                        Keep playing until most pieces of code has been finished, generating a scoreboard.

                        DETAILS
                    </strong>
                    This was inspired by Musical Code in Hack the Burgh 2016. Our group wanted to play it again, but decided we couldn't assemble a large enough group of nerds to play it, so we decided to make a web app for it.

                        Note
                    </strong>
                    It's not completely finished yet, but it's the idea that matters, right? :) Also, we do plan to complete it in the future.
