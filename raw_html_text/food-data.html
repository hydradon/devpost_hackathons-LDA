                    As a group, we didn't come in with a specific plan, but we knew that we wanted to make an impactful change to a massive problem. We considered issues plaguing American society and our youth, and we came upon the issue of obesity.

                <p>
                    Our code has a database of standard dishes that are consumed in American culture and thought to be very unhealthy. When the input is taken in, our code identifies it and gives the nutritional facts pertaining to the specific food.

                <p>
                    We had many other ideas previous to this one, but we weren't sure how we would go about approaching them, so a lot of time was spent conceptualizing and trying to convey our ideas. We also pursued a project for a sizable portion of the hacking period, so we couldn't have ameliorated our code to its full extent. One final obstacle that we had to face was the sudden departure of one of our group members, so we were inhibited from performing at our maximum capacity.

                    Our research was extensive and we were able to reflect upon our own eating habits, showing the code's benefits, and although our code isn't the greatest, our intentions and code could empower others to make a more impactful change in our community. It can also educate those who want to learn more about what they are consuming on a daily to weekly basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot from each other about, in a coding aspect and a teamwork aspect, and since we were all first-timers, we were able to gain a lot of experience, both technical and superficial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue to expand our database exponentially, so we can affect more and more people every day and make the world a happier AND healthier place for everyone.
