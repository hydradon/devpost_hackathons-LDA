                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m an Engineering Physics student&mdash;so I learn a lot about engineering, math, and physics. I know that fields in STEM are sometimes thought of as being &ldquo;cold&rdquo;,  and not as &ldquo;human&rdquo;, in a sense, as a field like, say, history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from struggling with understanding concepts at times, I struggle with my overall wellbeing. Something that&rsquo;s helped has been relating the STEM concepts I&rsquo;ve been learning to my own life. It makes STEM human, it brings me comfort, and it helps me remember/understand the content I'm learning. I thought it might help other people feel less alone, learn about STEM concepts, and make STEM feel more relatable&mdash;and that&rsquo;s where mylifeastoldbystem.com came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website where people can view, like, and submit user&rsquo;s submissions, all of which relate STEM concepts to real life. Right now there are four example posts:  an S, a T, an E, and an M. Read through the posts for an explanation!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see who submitted the post, and you can see how many likes the post has gotten. You can &ldquo;like&rdquo; it as many times as you want, similar to Medium claps&mdash;the idea behind this was so that people could spread as much love for STEM as they like, so I didn&rsquo;t want to put any restrictions on it. There is also Facebook liking functionality for further social media reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Submitted entries would be reviewed manually before being turned into a submission on the site.

                    I had a commitment earlier in the day, so I had to start hacking late&mdash;so I decided to work on my own. Taking care of the entire project from start to finish was fun, but it was a lot of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried getting a ton of things started&mdash;Angular, React, many, many node modules, MySQL, PHP (I'm 100% sure my PHP is somehow configured improperly)...every time I installed something, the command couldn't be found. I couldn't figure out how to configure my system, and after spending 10 hours trying to get something going, I decided to just put in a Facebook like button.
