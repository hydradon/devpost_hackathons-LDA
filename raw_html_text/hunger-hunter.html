                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team member, Trevor Knox, had experience in a catering service that would end up wasting a bunch of food after events because no one went through the effort to donate the food to a food bank. In order to solve this, Trevor suggested this app which connects donors and food banks together into one app in order to minimize food waste and to benefit the community as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows donors to find information on nearby food banks and to get in contact with them to donate food. The app streamlines the process by showing nearby food banks in the area and providing contact info right within the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized MIT's App Inventor to develop the application along with Google's Firebase Cloud to create the database to store information. Also utilizes Google Maps API to show local food banks near your location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also utilized Domain.com's free domain to embed our APK online for Android users to download and for consumers to appreciate the website and our mission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase updated in the middle of the night which changed the API key which resulted in a lot of permission denied errors. Issues also included storage of data where data would be overwritten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a visually pleasing application that is simple and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we need to be more vigilant about our API keys as well as how we handle data.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hunger Hunter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better input validation as well as allowing food banks to input more data such as quantity of food they are willing to accept as well as type of food and business hours.
