                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our story begins with all of us having glasses. We all have relatively terrible vision, so we all know what it feels like to be partially blind, we know the pain that you feel when you forget your glasses. If our struggles are this drastic, then we can only imagine the struggle of those who have no vision to help them throughout their day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our "glasses" have two main functionalities; 1) It uses a camera to capture an image containing text, which is then translated into speech and sent through headphones to the user. 2) It also has an ultrasonic sensor, which uses ultrasonic pulses to determine the distance of an object from the user. This, in turn, keeps the user safe from slamming into a wall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the whole thing off of a Gear VR Headset (using none of the functionality of the VR itself), attaching a plethora of components to breadboards; LCD, Ultrasonic Sensor, Piezo, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One specific challenge was the LCD. We noticed that it had stopped working, after having been perfect for the previous test. To fix the problem, we rewired the whole thing three times, using up hours of our time, when in the end, the problem was that we had mixed up two pins that sent signals to the display.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole thing is a marvel of engineering that we couldn't be more enthusiastic about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used all 24 hours of our time wisely, and throughout the experience, we derived a superfluity of lessons and morals. The most obvious and important one was most certainly patience. Our code had malfunctioned in overabundance, and patience definitely helped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eyes 4 U
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to incorporate many features that improve upon our initial prototype, including a sleeker build without exposed wires, a lighter and more uniform headset, a better proximity sensor, and so much more.
