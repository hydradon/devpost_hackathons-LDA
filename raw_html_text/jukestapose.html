                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friends tend to study and do homework together often, at least from what we have observed from our own personal experience. Lots of times we find ourselves sitting side by side, with our headphones on, sending each other links to songs we are currently jamming out to. Often we find ourselves singing along to a song we are listening to and have everyone join in. This prompts the immediate pausing of all other music and the unplugging of the headphones currently transferring the signal of the current jam. How much easier would it be if we could all just add our songs to a collective queue that would play each song choice from each person's queue in a round robin fashion from one central set of speakers?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jukestapose is a LAN server designed to be run a small, IOT-scale device. Users sign on to the device's network to gain access to a web portal, from which they can upload songs to to their a fairly distributed queue so that everyone here's a bit of what they want. Music can the listened to over the web or through a speaker attached to the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We configured a DragonBoard to run nginx and serve a flask server. The flask app serves the web interface for file uploads and exposes a set of API endpoints that collect user requests and information on song state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an interesting time configuring the DragonBoard for development (the first device we tried was actually missing an essential port altogether), and none of us had set up a nginx server before. We also pushed the limits of HTTP protocol by transferring a large number of audio files between servers and clients, which both have the ability to play for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We kept a really agile development schedule and integrated a fairly complex stack of frontend, backend, server software, and hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a new appreciation for Linux as an IOT operating system and the problems and solutions presented in simultaneous streaming.  We enjoyed working with the DragonBoard, and plan to use it in some of our upcoming IOT projects.  Our communication as a team allowed us to pivot when necessary, and focus on what was a priority to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jukestapose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jukestapose is at its best with reliable, easy-to-start UX, so we hope to improve connectivity to work on a wider variety of network configurations (possibly an option to connect to a laptop and configure networks over a GUI). We'd love to polish this until it's a product worthy of sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine -- a collaborative music queue for business that allowed customers to set atmosphere that they enjoyed most.  Such a product could generate revenue for businesses, as users would be incentivized to buy credits to enjoy their music wherever they went.
