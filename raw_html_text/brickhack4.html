                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice-enabled shopping has revolutionized the way individuals shop today. This is the reason why, most companies are pushing towards incorporating speech recognition in their applications to make them more user-friendly and easy to use but still, except Amazon, no are major companies that have introduced voice recognition in their e-commerce platform. Our goal was to use Amazon Alexa voice recognition API, DynamoDB and Wegmans product APIs to create a voice-enabled Alexa skill to put purchase order for food ingredients on Wegmans website.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used AWS lambda functions and Alexa Skillset to build our app which takes voice input from the user for the choice of recipe.
After the choice is made, our app connects to Wegmans product API to fetch product data based on the ingredient of the product retrieved from DynomoDb database. After the products details are fetched, Alexa places an order for the products with the cheapest price and notifies the user with an SMS.
