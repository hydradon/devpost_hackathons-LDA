                    INSPIRATION: A sock with an LED light for athletes.

                <h2>
                    We started off wanting to provide socks with a light and from there we realized that the wearable light market was bigger than just socks.

                <h2>
                    A big challenge we faced was the limited amount of time allotted to prototype. Finding the right materials and of the right size and strength was the major difficulty.

                <h2>
                    We're most proud of our accomplishment in responding to market need and seeing past our own biases.
