                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help others who have a difficult time keeping track of their pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device takes one pill from the hopper and dispenses it after pressing a button on the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used 3D printed parts, an Arduino Uno with some servos and node.js along with java for the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time connecting it to the web so we have it plugged into a computer which then connects the device to the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the project working with the very nice 3D prints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to come together as a team and create an awesome health hack
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pill Drop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue working on this project with the integration of a fully functional mobile app and a new enclosed 3D printed housing for the mechanics of the device.
