                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Python and MySQL on the back-end to find deals from the flyers of different grocery stores.
Android Studio front end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing was inconsistent and unusable for our purposes.
Limited Android experience.
MySQL cannot directly connect to Android-&gt; BRICK WALL WE HIT AT 2AM
Existing code on the application took time to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to create and query databases, Android apps, text recognition and python dictionaries. Although the app is not complete, we accomplished most of what we set out to do! We also worked as a team for 24 hours and were able to produce a deliverable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a lot of progress in MySQL and Android Development. We learned that design is not a linear process, and that you spend a lot of time going back and forth before getting to a real solution. Sometimes, you have to sacrifice some features to meet a deadline.

                    Adding more grocery stores to pull data from. Price calculations based on the flyer deals. Connect the android app to the backend through a server.
