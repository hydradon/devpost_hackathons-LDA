                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, one of our families firsthand witnessed a hurricane obliterate the total farmland which they owned. The destroyed crops totaled a loss of close to $75,000 and it hit completely ruined the economic system in the village of our family. In order to alert and educate people in the US about the likely storm that will hit their specific state and how to prevent it from ruining their families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially the web-based application will allow the user to select their home state. After the user clicks on the state they live in, they will be led to an alternative page which gives the user a set of important details. Firstly, the user will be notified of what disaster is most prevalent in their state. This is done because many people each year are unaware that their specific state is more likely to be hit, for example, by a hurricane or a flood. Then there will be a brief history about massive storms that have affected their state previously. Finally, there will be a set of important procedures to follow to help become aware about the disaster. At the end of the page there will be a YouTube link that basically informs the user on the importance of being aware about the disasters that have occurred in their state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web-based application is built using HTML and CSS. We used several tags to denote the several unique parts of the user interface, and used CSS to change the style and edit fonts of our user interface. The tags helped create a button-reference user interface in which the user must click on a certain picture or button to see output on their screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times we were stuck in parts of our code where the user interface didn&rsquo;t turn out like it was supposed. For example, when we were trying to enter the images of the states into a grid, the format got very disoriented and even after hours of working, our group couldn&rsquo;t figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we got stuck several times throughout our code, our group is proud of the fact that we are able to present a completed web project. Sure it may not be the fanciest or flashiest piece of code that is going to reform the entire world, but the project serves a purpose: to help people become more aware of the natural disasters in their state and how to prevent against the.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve learned that teamwork and networking are ESSESNTIAＬ tools in the business of programming. We&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s not the people who write the code themselves who succeed in the real world, but people who can engage with others and build of each other&rsquo;s ideas who truly can have an effect on the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Natural Disaster Awareness in the US
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that we can take Natural Disaster Awareness to the next level by either going lower or higher. Going higher means that we will implement our code on the world-level, which will require a much larger UI. Going lower means that we will split each state into cities, and will apply the program to a much lower level. Either way, we&rsquo;re confident that we can take Natural Disaster Awareness to the next level.
