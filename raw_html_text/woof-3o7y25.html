                    We were inspired by
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Best Friends panel and their mission to end the killing of dogs in shelters.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matches dogs looking for new homes with individuals looking to adopt

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created web page and connected it to a database of users and their pets. We shuffle though these pets
and allow users to view pets and their details and "like" or "dislike" them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to run nodeJS and mongoose, as well as making sure all team members knew JavaScript.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished this program in 1 evening and taught ourselves how to
use databases and JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Database stuff
                </p>

                    What's next for woof
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand our horizons, and maybe one day include cats.
