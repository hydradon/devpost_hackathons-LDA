                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, I would go through my normal day and sometimes just feel stressed over worked by something going on in my life. I would eventually just get fed up and frustrated with inconveniences to me. I realized maybe if I had a little more context, I could pull through. This is my version of a tool that helps get a college student or anybody through their day.

                    The Bot is suppose to greet you and then proceed to send you a quote each time you prompt it.

                    Filtering out message responses what a challenge that was and is still kinda of a struggle.
