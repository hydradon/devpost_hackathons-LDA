                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to teach a little girl (about 6 years old) how to program, but she doesn't know how to type! For now, we're working with Scratch, but since she'll eventually need typing skills to learn a real programming language, I went looking for a good game to set her up with. I couldn't find any game that looked engaging and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an incremental game (think CookieClicker) that encourages kids to learn to type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used only Javascript, its standard library, CSS, and HTML. No outside APIS, libraries or similar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how HTML worked in the beginning. This was my first time doing anything even resembling web development -- I knew a little bit of JavaScript and HTML, but that's it. I had a new Google search open every 5 minutes for the first few hours until I got most the HTML done. Understanding enough CSS to use the boilerplate stylesheet that I found, getting everything to work together across files.

                    Adding achievements, balancing game play a little better, prettifying the page more, adding more words (maybe let users upload their own, custom lists?), maybe a prestige mechanic... There's lots I can do!
