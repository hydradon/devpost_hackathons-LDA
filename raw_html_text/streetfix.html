                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A desire to facilitate communication between communities and their government.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streetfix connects the community to local government to maintain a high quality urban environment. By providing a collaborative platform to local infrastructure inventory and management through crowdsourcing data, community members are able to report poor conditions in vehicular and pedestrian. Through the use of  geotaging, users are able to report poor conditions to maintain safe conditions within the community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created in HTML and CSS with some Javascript elements.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nailing down a concept that was specific in purpose without being too niche took some time. Codewise, implementing Google Maps functionality was a struggle, and there were some difficulties combining templates and work between team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a clear, elegant branding concept and interface design, as well as an innovative yet practical solution that can be readily adopted by local governments. Implementing Google Maps despite the struggles was a notable accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned team working skills as well as time management and problem solving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StreetFix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refinement of its core features and maybe expansion of them for more connection to social media.
