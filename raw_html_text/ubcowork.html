                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we have some knick-knack jobs that require an extra hand and services from another person. UBCOWork connects the user and the service provider, both of which are students helping each other and they can earn some quick bucks from that too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UBCOWork is a platform built for students who want to earn money by helping the community or get work done and pay for it. A student has two options, either pay for a service or provide a service to earn money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift language on the Xcode Editor to build an intuitive iOS App within 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had made an App before, so it was a completely new learning experience. We couldn't figure out the backend too quickly. Our main purpose was to get the concept out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a totally new language and building a mobile app, all within 24 hours, I would never have imagined that. Our team worked hard to learn constantly and implement the skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new language and a way to express ourselves. Diving into the new world of App Development was a great experience and we cherished every moment of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UBCOWork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to make it fully functional and lift it up from being a concept to a utility. We would love to expand this platform into different universities and start a subscription model around it.
