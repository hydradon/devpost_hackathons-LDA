                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blueant is the tool we all must fill out by the end of the week. Obviously this is a daunting task and we usually postpone it a lot. When your deadline comes and you have to fill it, you need to remember what you have done for the whole week! This is a very slow torture that we endure each week. It's 2019 and we still need to try to remember stuff!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eats ants. But seriously, it gathers what you have worked on from various resources to help you fill the Blueant. Maybe you attended several meetings? We got you covered! We'll get your meetings from your calendar. You have commited stuff/opened a merge request on GitLab? We have it. You did some coding reviews on GitHub. No worries! You spontaneously gossiped behind management in the kitchen during lunch time? That, not yet..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used electron framework to create a desktop application. Researched about the sources that we can use and found out how to access them. We built a simple ui to help you check your daily behaviour and a way to copy them easily!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating different APIs in such a short notice was a huge challenge. Also we faced blockers when trying to access outlook calendar apis and had to find workarounds quickly. Another challenge is that we are not fluent with UI/UX so we had to leave our comfort zone and this resulted in slow work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have managed to squeeze in integrating 3 different resources in so small amount of time. We have a working solution with all 3 of them and a way of extending it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start quick, perfect it later, how it looks is also important so have an artistic-minded colleague!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for anteater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to integrate text editors/IDE s to the tool to possibly get information on which files have you opened/edited in case you have been working on them all day but not pushed anything to the source control tool.
