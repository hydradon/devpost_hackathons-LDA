                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate getting out of bed, but once I get rolling, I want to finish everything I have to for the day in one fell swoop. I wanted to make a web app that finds the most compact way to go about your day so you don't have awkward breaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users enter three types of tasks:
                    <strong>
                        fixed
                    </strong>
                    which are at a certain place and time (a lecture),
                    <strong>
                        anytime
                    </strong>
                    which are at a location but can be done whenever (going to the store), and
                    <strong>
                        filler
                    </strong>
                    which are tasks that can be done anywhere, anytime, like emails, readings or eating the lunch you brought to campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I have used javascript, so I created the page in just one js file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An important part of scheduling tasks is the travel time between locations. I wanted to include Google Maps' Distance Matrix API but I had trouble setting it up so I opted to have the user enter travel times between all locations instead. I would like to finish this application properly by using the API because right now a lot of work is presented to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to javascript was fun and I'm glad I started on the basics. While the page doesn't do anything groundbreaking, I think the scheduling algorithm is a little tough to implement and I'm glad it works fairly well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dynamically adding elements to a web page is easier than I thought and really helps out with user interaction. 
I should have spent more time creating objects because the different types of tasks were hard to handle together and I mixed them up a lot.
                </p>
