                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of 0neFiesta was the with
                    <strong>
                        OneClick
                    </strong>
                    games
Kahoot and JackBox Games were the insperation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Runs simple games that support only 1 input (usually a click or a tap)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code was built with node.js and Javascript
The backend was built with node using socket.io, express and defined.js (custom project)
The front end was built on react, bundled with parcel using ant.design, and socket.io client
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having enough time to right the entire event handler system, also creating enough games with the knowledge at hand made this very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the web is very forgiving, so even though mistakes were made, it wasn't super hard to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never make one click games ever again with multiplayer functionality, though doing mobile apps may be different
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 0neFiesta
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe improve it to support custom games, or whatever really. It was just made for fun
                </p>
