                    Spiders. Everyone in the group has a common fear. We see pictures of those creepy crawlies all the time on social media from friends who troll. We wanted to stop breaking our computer screens in fear whenever they appeared.

                    Using Microsoft's Computer Vision API, we created a Chrome browser extension that scans the entire web page and looks to see if any images meet the user set phobia criteria. If there's a match, we hide the image.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we started with the base Javascript code that Microsoft provided for the Computer Vision API. From there, we developed our own framework that scans the page for images, and then automatically hides or shows those that meet the criteria. Next, we migrated our work from our test page to a full Chrome extension with standalone functionality.

                    At first, things were running very smoothly, and we barely had any errors in our code. Towards the end, we encountered many issues with creating Chrome extensions and storing the data locally. Even the mentors working at the Google table couldn't figure out what was wrong. Eventually, this problem was resolved by

                    We stayed up for over 28 consecutive hours attempting to fix all our major problems in order to ship a fully finished project.

                    Read up more on Chrome extensions before utilizing it. We learned about how some APIs can really be, and what an impact it can have on the world.
