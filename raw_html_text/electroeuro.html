                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Euro, which is a currency that unites major parts of Europe. We  wanted to solve the challenge question, and also solve an underlying larger social/political issue.  We also drew inspiration from the bitcoin, which is a virtual currency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collect data from the sensor network, in which each sensor is located next to a power source. We aggregated the data over the sensors and over a given time interval, and then estimated the energy surplus based on machine learning. This generates a market between counties, and we set pricing for the various energies. Pricing is based on greenness, stability, availability and distance of resource.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a sensor network and collected the data. We leveraged machine learning to estimate the surplus, and then we transformed the surplus into an energy market.
                </p>
