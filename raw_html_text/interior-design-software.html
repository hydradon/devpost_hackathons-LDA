                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have some experience with 3D development with VR
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were basically the first time working on the web development, the whole project was a challenge. However, we could get through!
