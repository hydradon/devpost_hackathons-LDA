                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    HQ wasn't on the blockchain. We decided to make HQ better by putting it on the blockchain.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    First, place a Ganache in the Truffle Box. Drizzle on the blockchain as desired and serve immediately.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <strong>
                        Application layer
                    </strong>
                    Interaction of the smart contract with our client-side web3 instance was a nightmare. Our solution took lots of head-scratching and keyboard bashing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Solidity
                    </strong>
                    When using the factory approach we had difficulty determining 'ownership' of a new daughter contract. Our solution was to pass the msg.sender to the daughter's constructor in order to explicitly declare daughter's owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were unable to test our payable function in a solidity test contract
game.register.value(entryFee)(playerName);
                </p>

                    Completing a working game and user-interface in such a short period of time!

                <p>
                    Ethereum is a very long way from being a suitable platform for any business solutions. We had a lot of fun though!
