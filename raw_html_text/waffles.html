                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students have problems staying focus in the 2-hour Engineering seminars. And we want to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine that we built shoots a little cushion at people who have not been participating enough in seminars, to remind that they should engage and contribute to the discussion more, while having a little fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mechanical component with wood, motors and servos. Also, we used Arduino to connect all the components together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The shooting mechanism was challenging since we did not have a motor of any sort that was powerful enough to shoot the cushion out like a solenoid plunger.
However, we eventually solved the problem with creating a slingshot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine allows up to two degrees of freedom when shooting the cushion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this experience, we learned how to create a machine under time pressure.

                    What's next for Waffles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the next problem that UofT students encounter in their courses, and change that.
