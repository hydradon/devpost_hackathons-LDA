                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a webMD like website. It was intended to be humorous and not to be taken seriously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter your symptoms. If we find it, we'll match a terrible drug (side effects listed) for it. Else we just tell you to start praying
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Html/css + a little bit of bootstrap for the frontend. Python flask framework for backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only knew rudimentary html/css. No knowledge of bootstrap or how to run python scripts on a web server. Or how to setup a web server, or how to get a domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We googled everything we didn't know, prodded around with the bugs until they gave up and got a pretty nice looking website up!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many bugs are from mundane things. Forgetting to capitalize POST, didn't surround something in brackets, (particularly frustrating was) the browser caching websites so changes don't show up even when you're sure they're there. Personally I learned how to setup a AWS server so that's pretty nice
