                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I just want to share a file, but don't want to jump through a lot of hoops. This is for easy one time file sharing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can upload a file and specify download and time limits. It either works as a web app or desktop app that communicates with a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A whole lot of javascript and Node.js (Express). Very vanilla, plain stuff, didn't want to deal with very complicated modern javascript libraries and the like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not many, pretty straightforward project
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    We got it to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    File verification and checksums, some pretty cool stuff!
                </p>

                    What's next for Xapti
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Desktop context menus, full scale release on the web, better HTML design.
