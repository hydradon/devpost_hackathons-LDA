                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make an automated writer that would copy the image of handwriting written on an adafruit TFT display, several times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Servo Motors and Arduino Uno
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time looking for a compatible material to bulid the arms of the writer. There is some difficulty in mapping the handwriting points to angular and rotational data that are utilized by the motors.

                <p>
                    Having a clear objective about the project the team would like to do is a very helpful strategy to effectively work as team during the event
