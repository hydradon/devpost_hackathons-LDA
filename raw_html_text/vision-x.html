                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A client wanted an app that helps him to guid new employers around the company and teach them what to do at certain machines. I used this hackathon as an excuse to build a prototype with the functionality he is looking for (placing markers in 3D space / location based chat). Since this 3D markers also make a good use for a location based social network we are experimenting with certain social network features like location based chats, 3d emojis ...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vision X shows your surrounding augmented by information displayed with 3d markers. Place 3d objects (markers, emojis, chat points) in your surrounding, get information about your community and interact in location based chats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Logging in to the B2B version, companies can create restricted private spaces only visible to certain people. These spaces can be used to on-board new employers, show waypoints to guide people to certain areas in your facilities or provide information at certain locations (info on what certain buttons at a machine do).
There is also a remote features where a employer can share his screen with an supervisor who can than place markers on the employers AR space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reach many people, Vision X runs on almost every mobile device. No need for special AR glasses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vision X was build with Unity3D (C#,Objective-C,Java,Javascript). This allows the app to run on mobiles as well as in browsers (WebGL) and share a lot of its codebase. The server part is a node server that stores the markers and allows to retrieve them from a mongoDB database. WebRTC is used for the remote AR screen functionality.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Integrate Okta with Unity3D. 
WebRTC connection between browser and mobile. 
Place 3D objects in AR.

                    It works!!!

                        I got better at writing plugins for Unity

                        webGL and webRTC

                    What's next for Vision X
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More development time to improve the B2B aspect of the app. Once everything runs smoothly for companies I plan to release the app to the public and see how the visual social network feature works out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to open-source the login module for Unity so other people can use it in their app. Login, especially on mobile, is a real pain point in Unity. This could also be published in the Unity Asset Store as a free download.
