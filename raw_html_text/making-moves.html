                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    They doubted me, so I went hard.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android-wear is a infantile platform, and had a lot of bugs and missing features. For example, most new android wear watches come with GPS and Wifi built in, but our LG G watch had only a bluetooth connection to the phone to work with, so our options were limited.

                <p>
                    Supports Ambient mode on Android-Wear. It was our first time working with the compass and GPS on a real device.
