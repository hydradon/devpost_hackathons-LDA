                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Booking travel is time consuming and difficult, and often we are doing it when we don't want to spend a lot of time lining up travel arrangements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carmen Travel lets you effortlessly book travel just by telling it what you want.  Additionally, Carmen Travel can authenticate you through a voice-based biometric authentication that sidesteps the lengthy, time consuming username, password, and credit card input process.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built with common cloud technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and leveraging several Microsoft Cloud AI APIs including the Bing Speech API and Speaker Recognition API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the API results are returning incomplete or not working info (such as the booking API POST requests).  Application was still able to be built however and solutions can be added as they come through!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is way easier than booking travel normally!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open Travel APIs are awesome and really easy to use.  I can imagine with more data and expanded functionality, these would be a really powerful toolset for travel application developers.
                </p>

                    What's next for Carmen Travel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See how people like it, continue developing and maybe offer a commercial solution soon!
