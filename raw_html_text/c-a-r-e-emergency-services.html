                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally a competition between two ideas aimed at saving lives during emergency situations, C.A.R.E. arose as an amalgamation of a warning beacon and a kiosk reporting system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user reports an emergency, the kiosk's exact address is transmitted to the appropriate service(s) that the user requested. The kiosk has common scenarios embedded into the reporting system. So, if one of the specific issues are relevant to the user, they can ask for the scenario to be executed, and select relevant services. The user also has an "other" option, in which they can type their input, to ensure that all user cases are provided for. The proper authorities receive a text message that notifies them of the type of accident and the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app was built with the Ember API on the client side. Based on user's selected situations, the client sends an http request to the server-side. The server side is written with node.js and implements the Twillio API that handles the http requests by creating and sending text messages to specified emergency services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, our group struggled with coming up for an idea to pursue during the hackathon. There are many different implementations for the ideas that we threw around so deciding to choose one posed a problem as well. Once we finally decided to pursue an idea that worked with the Innovate NB kiosks, we were met with the challenge of learning new platforms and technologies that none of us were used to, such as ember.js and node.js. There were also problems with creating multiple actions, formatting the code, and simply making the application look good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group walked into this project without knowing each other and without knowing all the technologies we were required to used. Nonetheless, we were able to complete the project without "butting heads." We are also proud of some things within the code as well, such as getting Twilio to send specific issue requests to the proper authorities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technologically wise, we learned about new applications for different languages and gained more JavaScript experience. We also learned how to work with people that we are not necessarily familiar with in order to accomplish a common goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for C.A.R.E. (Emergency Services)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now C.A.R.E. is purely a text-to-911 application, however we hope to expand its capabilities to include voice, photo, and real-time communication. We also want to handle sending more specific user cases in a faster way to the proper authorities so a proper response is executed.
