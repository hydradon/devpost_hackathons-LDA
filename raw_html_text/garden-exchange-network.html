                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documentary on community gardens inspired us to create  way for those gardens to connect and help each other out if they need it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects community gardens to each other and lets members of each garden rate how the garden is doing in terms of cleanliness, productivity, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created python classes for the gardens and the people associated with those gardens. The class for the gardens showed their location and what produce they had available. The class for the people had functions that allowed them to rate and comment on the gardens that they are a part of. We used flask to connect the python code to a front end website that allows people to log in and interact with the gardens, check where other gardens are at, check what produce is available, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into is connecting the python code to the website, and we were trying to decide which framework to use to do so, and debugging any issues that came up with the one we eventually chose: flask.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picking up a new framework and new programming techniques that we wouldn't have done if not for the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about how to combine python development and web development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Garden Exchange Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish up the code and fix the rest of the issues, then talking to actual community gardens to see if they would be willing to take part in this network
                </p>
