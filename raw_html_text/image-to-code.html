                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made this website because we are often very lazy to type the code whenever our professor writes it on the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website, Image to Code, turns a simple image of handwritten code into actual code displayed on your computer!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it the program using Imgur and Google Cloud Vision APIs and Python. We built the website through HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For everyone on the team, we never used APIs before and have little knowledge of Python. 4/5 of the team members also never been to a hackathon until Cutie Hack 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the event, we attempted to use Microsoft, Imgur, and Google Cloud Vision APIs to read the text in the photos; however, we only successfully got the Imgur API work and implemented into our project. We also attempted to use the Microsoft API, but it never worked, so we opted for Google Cloud Vision API. We got the Google Cloud Vision API to work, but we were not able to figure out how to incorporate it into our website.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate in a time-pressured environment. We also learned what are APIs and how APIs work.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to approach our next hackathon! We also learned about APIs!
