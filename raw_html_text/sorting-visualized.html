                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As my degree comes to a close, I realized that I spent most of my time working on the back end, and while I enjoy the manipulation without taking in user interaction, I found that front end was a skill I was very lacking. In order for me to establish technologies as a full stack developer, it was imperative to have some knowledge of the front end to eventually create clean GUIs. A technology is only good if it is usable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It randomizes numbers and sorts them in a particular sorting algorithm. It provides a 3D representation for the movement of the blocks which are representative of the numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After coding up the different algorithms, the hardest step was using WebGL and ThreeJS to manipulate blocks into appearing and disappearing at real time. I also had to provide different calculations to make sure the camera was showing it in a spotlight. This project also allowed me to work with different textures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have no real front end experience, so most of this project was just a challenge in and of itself. I had to start my learning from ground zero when dealing with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am incredibly proud of how far my front end skills have gotten by the end of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of front-end technologies and now I feel more adept at working both the front end and the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sorting: Visualized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to one day expand this as a teaching opportunity to show children and other people earlier in their college degree a visual representation of different algorithms and data structures.
