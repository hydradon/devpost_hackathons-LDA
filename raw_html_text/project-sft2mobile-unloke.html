                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brings privacy sensitive documents to mobile users in a secure way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two customers (Monaco police and COA) that have a requirement for delivering personal documents / emails to mobile users in a secure way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    User Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customer has a mobile application and a traditional OE application that handles sensitive information of its users.
At some point, the user of the mobile application needs access to documents that were generated locally from the OE application in a secure way.
Mobile user authenticates against KeyCloak using oAuth2. and has the option to have sensitive data sent to him/her in a secure way in the form of a PDF document. Email is not considered a safe way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Components
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Simple mobile app with a request for some sort of sensitive data option (NativeScript / Angular)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kinvey as a throughput for data, but also for sending the push notifications when a document is ready for download
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MoveIT Transfer / MoveIT Automation for automated secure file transfer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        OpenEdge database with sensitive data and a service (PASOE) that enables for the generation of PDF documents and creating tasks in MoveIT
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How does it work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user of the app will initiate a data request, the OE service will collate the PDF and drop it off somewhere and MiT can pick it up from here via a MiA script. The users would also install the MiT mobile app, so that they can download the file from that mobile app once it's ready.
MiT server will get the LDAP info from their application server and the users will then use the same mobile app credentials for the MiT mobile app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Considerations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main thing they would need to do outside of MOVEit is come up with a way of identifying who is requesting the PDF, but I assume you already have this covered.
If you can create a folder structure on the network and we match the folder structure on Transfer, the application should detect who is requesting the file and place it into the proper folder (negates the need for email).
Then we can have a task in automation that sweeps the folders, when it detects a file it moves it to the matching folder on transfer so the customer can see it.
They can get notified when the file is ready to be downloaded via the MiT browser or mobile app.
