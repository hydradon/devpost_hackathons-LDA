                    This PennApps brought us Hacker Gurus, who act as mentors in a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But not everyone got a guru, and not everyone ended up in a guru-led team that they liked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we brought HackingTogether, an app that forms balanced teams of beginner and intermediate hackers as well as hacker gurus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also guarantees that all team-members want to make something on the same platform, which will lead to a more productive and engaging hackathon.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How it works:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Hacker Gurus and Hackers interested in being part of a guru-led team can register using our simple, material-themed Android App (iOS and Web coming soon)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data is stored in a cloud-based database using the Parse API
                </p>
                <p>
                    At a given point, a Python program that matches all the teams (by communicating with Parse via REST) runs and adds the teams as a seperate class into the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the Android App will see that the teams have been formed and will thus show them - and prevent the user from changing their preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only information visible to team-members will be their names and the Devpost profile link of the Guru.
                </p>
