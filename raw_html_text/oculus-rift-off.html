                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, transportation has become a big part of our lives in order to get from Point A to Point B. Feeling bored while traveling isn't anything new. So, we decided to create something that allows us to enjoy the ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The "Oculus Rift-Off" takes advantage of VR technology to immerse the user in an alternate world which is based off their surroundings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First off, an input stream is taken by the PiCam. The stream is then transferred to a host device through a Raspberry Pi. Then, through the use of neural networks and "Unreal Engine", we are able to alter the real-time video from the PiCam into something amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to "Unreal Engine" was a challenge for some of us. There are many different options and the interface is clustered, making it hard to understand the essence of the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to "Unreal Engine" and passing the problems mentioned above was an amazing feeling. There were a lot of "Eureka" moments. A few of which are: When the PiCam connected successfully, when the view of the user inside of the car was placed properly, and when the simulation started working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to use the simulation software "Unreal Engine", and integrate real time video into virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oculus Rift-Off
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the user interface even better. Increasing the resolution of the input camera and the speed of the processing unit for conversion would allow for a smoother user interaction.
