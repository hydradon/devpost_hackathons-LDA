                    At some point in their lives, around one fifth of the population will be in need of a physiotherapist, however waiting lists are long and heavily underserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reduce the burden on physios, we've developed a system that helps deliver and track a user's progress with their exercise plan, utilising in-browser machine learning via the webcam to identify when users are performing said exercises and for how long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This could have wider implications for exercise monitoring, motivation, and wellbeing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exercise and stretch routines for the elderly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rehabilitation from injury and surgery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gamification of physio treatment plans
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitoring form
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, the same technologies can be used for various fitness activities, such as remote and automated classes for yoga, conditioning, pilates, stretches, and powerlifting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extensions could be adding on pose prediction and correction suggestions by modelling the body landmarks as a pose skeleton, perhaps using a Kinect or possibly still the webcam. The control system or UI could also be voice activated to interface while mid-exercise.

                    This was built with
                    <strong>
                        TensorflowJS
                    </strong>
                    with training and prediction done in-browser, so images never leave your machine for privacy, there is no reliance on a high broadband connection, and is scalable as there is significantly lower server load.
