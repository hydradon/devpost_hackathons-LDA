                    My first time doing a hackathon and I had an interesting experience. Should have joined a team :/ Did all by myself.
Well, but definitely I've learned a lot of things this weekend. I'm looking forward for the next Vanhackathon.

                    I kept the project simple, using Swift with I'm familiar and Firebase (just got excited from Google I/O conference this week ). It turns out Firebase database (json tree style) is more complicated than I've imagined.
Lot of bugs and in some point I though about create the project using Telegram, since it is under GNU GPL v. 2 lincese witch I think it would  allow me to do it, but I don't think copy a project and change the skin is the goal here.

                    thanks everyone in Hootsuite for the time.
