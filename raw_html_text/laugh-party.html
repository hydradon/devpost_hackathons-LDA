                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laugh Party is one of my favorite party games. A few people gather in a circle and start pretending to laugh, spontaneously emitting various noises to prompt others to laugh out loud. Soon, everyone in the circle is laughing and having a great time! Laugh Party is an excellent mood setter and fun for all ages. The more people the better!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this skill, Alexa is a fellow player in the classic party game where monotone "hahas" turn into a laughing riot! Just say, "Alexa ask Laugh Party to have a laugh party" and she'll join in on the fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Laughs are randomly generated, so the party's different every time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also say, "Alexa, ask Laugh Party to play a random laugh" and she'll emit a single laugh. It's great for telling jokes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hosted my code with Amazon Lambda and created intents using the Alexa Skill Kit. To generate laughs, I first created a list of laugh syllables. For each laugh, a random syllable is picked and repeated 1-5 times,with randomly generated pitch, speed, and interval for more spontaneous laughs. When Laugh Party is called, Alexa starts consecutively speaking these randomly generated laughs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially had trouble getting multiple laughs to play. I wanted laugh party to recursively laugh, but couldn't figure out how to do this because the recursive call would not be reached after the first response was sent. I ended up sending a long response speech of generated laughs instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to have been able to make a working Alexa skill of one of my favorite things after doing the codecademy tutorial. In addition, one of the first things I was considering doing was creating a pre-determined list of laughs to have Alexa speak. This version of laugh party uses randomly generated laugh noises, so the laugh party is different (and more fun!) every time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot and had a lot of fun making this Alexa skill, including how to use SSML tags, create intents, and configure a lambda function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Laugh Party
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to get feedback on Laugh Party to make it more fun and laugh-inducing.
