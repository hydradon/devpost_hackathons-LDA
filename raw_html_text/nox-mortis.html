                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rise of simulation style horror games. How to make the player feel as vulnerable and isolated as possible? Avoiding the predictability of other horror games by introducing randomized time intervals and scares.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A randomized VR horror experience that strips control away from the player and leaves them at the mercy of the game. Over 20+ unique, randomly selected scares ensure that no play-through will be the same.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using unity3D, C# and the google cardboard sdk. Features a mixture of personally created assets and modified third party assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming a foundation that was easy to test and modular enough to scale as I continued to add more scares.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing clean, quality code and a visually appealing product as the lone developer. Submitting the game on Android / iOS. Watching people's strong reactions as they play :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I wasn't sure that people would take to a game with little to no interactive elements. But I found that people loved the experience and thrill it provides! Consequently, I found wider audience was able to play this game since it requires no prior gaming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nox Mortis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take the successes i've learned from this project. I want to continue to make games that a wide audience can play (even non-gamers) and develop a practical model for monetization.
