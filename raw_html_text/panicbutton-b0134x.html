                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app for college students which allows them to easily make calls and send text messages when they are in dangerous areas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses andorid NFC and on a single click it sends out a mass text message to all the people in the contacts you designate in app, and on double tap will call your main emergency contact which is set in app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the twilio api to send out mass text messages, and then used android studio to develop the NFC interactions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the permissions to the android app and setting up the sql server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get sql integration, use the twilio api, and have NFC functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team, and split off roles in a way that was productive, and allowed us to make multiple parts of the program simultaneously
                </p>

                    What's next for PanicButton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve the UI and UX experience
                </p>
