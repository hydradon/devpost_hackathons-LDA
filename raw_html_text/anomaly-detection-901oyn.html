                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the challenge. There were 2 ways to do it, one with clustering and one with buckets and I thought that it'd be cool to try it to learn it cause it's real customer data I get to play with.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds anomalys in the detection.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Use num ID to filter similar sounding words, add to anomaly if exists only once
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use similar to filter similar sounding words, add to anomaly if it is unique
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Date time of the columns to calculate the time since last purchase for each item
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Run Isolation Forest clustering on each group, and add it to anomaly if it is an outlier
                    </li>

                <p>
                    It was a really big dataset, so it was really hard to work with due to the small unique exceptions

                    Make it better and faster, maybe add unsupervised learning
