                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing that one of our team members brought a WiitMote and Guitar Hero guitar, we wanted to make something that utilized both. Our inspiration came from two videogames many of us have played: Guitar Hero, and Osu!.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our video game is a game based on coordination, reflexes, and timing. Easy to pick up, but hard to master!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Processing 3 to create a graphic interface that our game is based around. Also, we used special drivers to connect the WiiMote to our laptops, mapping certain keys on the WiiMote to keys on our keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we ran into was connecting the WiiMote to our laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to finish our game. We're happy with our final product, and are proud of what we have to present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some members learned Processing 3 for the first time while others learned how to use GitHub and git management. We also learned the importance of teamwork. Dividing the roles of the project into multiple subgroups made undertaking this endeavor much easier.
                </p>

                    What's next for Acoustic Champion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can polish it to a point where Greenlighting it on a digital distribution platform becomes a reality.
