                <p>
                    <em>
                        We identified the lack of proper financial and economic education for the large socioeconomic gap in the society and sought ways to aim to better the education system in that term. The solution that we collectively agreed upon was the idea of a virtual novel that would illustrate a typical financial lifecycle of a person starting from high school all the way to their retirement.

                    <em>
                        The virtual novel provides life choices for a typical high school student to select from as he/she journeyed their life. The catch is, every choice comes with a financial consequence and whether or not they made the best financially responsible choices will effect their overall well-being at retirement age, thus teaching them of the importance of every financial situation in the modern age. They would also be directed other online sources if they desired to learn more about any part of the story they are more interested in.

                    <em>
                        We used ren-py, a free virtual novel building platform using Python to create our project.

                    <em>
                        The main challenges that we encountered was deciding the right format for the best UX. Another part was the decision as to cut down on what part of the life cycle and the many options that would be available in real life to tailor the project into achievable scope for 24hours.
