                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    11 years ago, our world was irreparably changed. The events of The Occurrence have long been shrouded in layers of corporate secrecy, but everyone alive knows the importance of that world-shattering discovery -
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            JUICE.
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    Long had humanity searched for a source of endless power, but it was not found among the gilded halls of alchemy. This holy grail was found in a far humbler place: The Bar of The Multiverse. The knowledge of Juice, long dormant, resurfaced in 2077. Our search for unlimited energy has ended. The mech wars have just begun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Philosophy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of Juice. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to
exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Juicy by its opponents in power?  Where is the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Juice, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two things result from this fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I.  Juice is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    II.  It is high time that fans of Juice should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Juice with a Manifesto of the party itself.

                    After the overwhelmingly positive response we received to 2019's Award-Winning cult and agnostic classic,

                    , we knew that we needed to take gaming into the future.  For the first time ever gaming has been brought into the 21st century.  By looking further into the future than anyone before us, we can tell a harrowing tale of the folly of man, and the power of Juice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interactive experience allows you to enter the cyberpunk dystopian future where mega-corporations are in charge, drinks rule, and mechs are cool.  Juice has provided the means for the downtrodden to rise up against their oppressors.  As a pilot for the Ultimate Multiverse Bar (UMB), you are leading the charge.  Be The Hero the people need.  Suit up, punch buildings, score points, get Juice.

                    Unity is a terrible engine that has been constantly riddled with major, breaking bugs since release. It is remarkable that anyone has ever managed to develop software in Unity.

                <p>
                    After our Oscar's snub, we found ourselves lost and without cause.  Through intensive soul-searching and group therapy, we now have direction.  So today, we are excited to announce the youth novelization of the PROJEKT JUICE Canon.  Written through a collaboration between Stephenie Meyer and Adam Levine, we are hoping to bring this sci-fi fantasy romance thriller to a younger demographic.
