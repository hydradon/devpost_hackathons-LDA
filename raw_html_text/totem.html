                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So at the start of September somebody made fradulent purchases on my credit card.
Then someone tried to get into my facebook. I don't believe in coincidences, so it was time to nuke the planet from orbit and change my passwords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I'm guilty of password reuse. So, I wanted something that would generate 128-bit hashes and would make keeping track of them easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and I wanted it to be cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically a chrome extension that generates passwords and stores them to a mongodb/node instance on heroku.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kicker is that to access it, you have to use a totem. Your totem is a unique item that you use instead of a traditional passcode or number string ala text. It's multifactor authentication that requires both a user's phone and knowledge of what their totem is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clarifai's api powers image recognition. Due to time constraints, sadly no custom learning, but it's typically accurate enough that I didn't have any problems with obscurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chrome extension was javascript and jquery.
I used Cordova with the Intel XDK to build the phone app. 
Lastly, node on a heroku instance and a mongolabs instance to tie everything together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was originally going to use react native but they don't have support for camera on android yet... or really ios, for that matter. Then, I found out Cordova 5 is absolutely broken when it comes to making http requests. A lot of time was spent trying to find solutions to pretty much insurpassable problems. Eventually I just reverted to an older version of Cordova - this forced me to tone down the mobile app greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time building a chrome extension and my first foray into taking photos on mobile. I'm really, REALLY proud of getting this all tied together - there was a point at 7:00 where I didn't think I would make it to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't trust Cordova.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I jest :) It was really cool to work with clarifai's api and I'm sure that I'll use it in the future. Also, it was nice to build a chrome extension for the first time - getting used to the nuances of working on the extension was more than worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Totem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I cut a lot of corners and did some things that are insecure as hell - so yeah, as a password vault, those need to get fixed. I plan on using this for personal use first, so I'm going to improve the UX before going public with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually I'd like to get some custom image training and put this out on the chrome app store + google play store.
