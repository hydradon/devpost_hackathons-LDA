                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to better people's lives, making them happier and healthier. We thought this would be a great way to achieve such a task, and bring communities closer together in a sustainable way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FoodMe takes your location and recommends recipes based on what local produce is currently in season. The goal of this is to help you live healthier, and reach out to your local farmers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, JS, and Google's Geocoding API we were able to parse the individuals location, and provide feedback in a presentable, easy to use interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Geocoding API was very inconsistent, changing its output format during use. This made it very difficult to interface it with our web application. Another challenge we had was connecting our front and back end to provide a seamless transfer of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API calls was something new to our group, and we were able to successfully figure it out. We also feel the website design was done quite well, being both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned API calls, a lot of back end interfacing, and some more advanced front end formatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FeedMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be to better implement the API calls, include some machine learning to better curate the results, and to expand the service. Some future ideas are to have a browser for local bakeries, delis, fruit stands, etc.
