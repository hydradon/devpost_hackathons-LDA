                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that combines music and communication in a fun, lighthearted game between friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application is a fun, competitive game where two players go head to head in quoting musical lyrics . Both players are presented with a random topic and must quote a  relevant song within the given time frame. It checks online with the Musixmatch api to determine if you are actually quoting a song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "We built this app on rock and roll." Our web application runs on a Microsoft Azure serve. The main portion of the code is written in JavaScript with a front-end in HTML and CSS. We included the Musixmatch API to confirm the validity of player inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our back-end was relatively unfamiliar with JavaScript so there was a bit of a learning curve there. We also had a few issues with dependency versions conflicting with one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud to have created a full fledged app over the course of a weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon experience for one of our members.We also learned a lot about setting up Azure servers and building full-stack JavaScript applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lyrics With Friends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding IBM Bluemix language capabilities to check whether the quote was on topic as well as add a voice to text feature for actual sing off battles.
