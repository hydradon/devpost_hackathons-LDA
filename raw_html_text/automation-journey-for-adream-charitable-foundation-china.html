                    </strong>
                    is a non-profit organization founded in Shanghai on August 2008, endeavoring to address
                    <strong>
                        inequalities in China&rsquo;s education sector
                    </strong>
                    via a wide spectrum of projects and services, collectively known as the &ldquo;Adream Center&rdquo; network. The network serves
                    <strong>
                        underprivileged children in rural areas and urban inner-cities

                <p>

                    <strong>
                        ability to forge their own opportunities rather than just providing them with physical goods

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project automates the ledger reconciliation process of Adream Foundation' public donation records. By accessing and downloading from
                    <strong>
                        4 major payment platforms
                    </strong>
                    on a regular basis, the donation data these platforms are further processed to produce reconciliation statements, which will then be sent to their finance department for public release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alipay, WeChat Pay, TenPay, and Tencent Foundation - the aforementioned 4 platforms are
                    <strong>
                        extremely popular and most commonly used for donations
                    </strong>
                    in China, therefore the completed UiPath components/functions are
                    <strong>
                        highly reusable
                    </strong>
                    for other NGOs and future development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is built on the use of
                    <strong>
                        UiPath
                    </strong>
                    as the automation tool. All key intermediate tables will be stored in designated folders and kept for a period, making traceable the calculation and reconciliation process. Adream staff will be informed timely when the automation process ends or when any exceptions occur.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regarding the security concerns, the automation process starts after users manually log into the payment platforms; however, different platforms have different logout time durations for users' being inactive, and the time spent on generating and downloading public donation records from 4 different platforms also varies from a few seconds to several minutes. Thus, it is challenging for us to design a proper workflow to avoid automatic logout when waiting for the data generation. Finally, we have figured out the optimal solution for an effective workflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has helped the Adream Foundation
                    <strong>
                        save up to 80%
                    </strong>
                    of the time used to reconcile public donation records. In addition, the reconciliation used to be performed on a monthly basis because of limited staff and resources, while after the processes being automated, Adream foundation are now able to significantly increase the reconciliation frequency and accuracy, and better positioned to keep pushing for an open and transparent public charity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through working with the Adream team on the RPA project, we have better understood about what and how an NGO works every day, and also familiarized ourselves regarding what an NGO expects from digitalization and new technology to improve efficiency, unleash resources to address more pressing issues, and elevating their credibility by establishing an operating model that exceeds the expectation from the public.
