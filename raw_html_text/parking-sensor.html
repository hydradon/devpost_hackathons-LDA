                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, while driving, Sarah backed into a pole. If she had this technology at the time, she would not have backed into the pole, which is what inspired us to create it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its purpose is to notify a driver of when they get too close to an object so they stop. When the driver is far enough away, there is a green light that tells them that they have space to move. When the driver gets too close, the green light turns into a red light and the sensor plays a tune to tell the driver that they have to stop.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected wires from Arduino to a breadboard, to which we attached a PWM, an ultrasonic sensor, and red and green LED lights.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the basics of coding in Arduino was difficult, but we managed to overcome this by experimenting and trying different things.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're both first years with little to no coding or hardware experience so the whole process of putting everything together and creating the right code was rewarding.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of coding and circuitry for future use in various applications.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Parking sensor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add to this project by creating a way for the LED lights to fade in and out. For example, if the car is really far away, the green light would be very bright, but it would get dimmer and dimmer as the car got closer and closer.
