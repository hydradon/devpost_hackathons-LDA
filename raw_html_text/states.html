                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's an awesome arts &amp; crafts project where people cut out photos in the shape of the state they were taken in. They look super cute pinned onto a big wall map. But there's not an app that does that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    States scans your photo library and identifies which photos were taken in each state. These photos are masked in the shape of their state &amp; drawn on a map of the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses GeoJSON to represent individual states. It parses a list of longitude/latitude coordinates and turns it into a polygon path. This path makes it super easy to check if a photo was taken inside the State, but it was
                    <strong>
                        shockingly
                    </strong>
                    difficult to render the polygon on screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for States
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At this point, it's nothing more than a rough prototype. The polygon rendering would need to be redone since it isn't very robust. I think it's an idea that's actually worth publishing though. I might get around to it one day.
