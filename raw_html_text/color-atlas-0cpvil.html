                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When travelling, we've found that taking pictures impairs ones ability to enjoy the experience and remember their time. To help with this, we wanted to provide a service that helps us revisit past experiences and encourages us to fondly remember where we've spent our time. We recently saw an Apple Maps picture car driving by and decided we also wanted to make something which takes pictures for us and allows us to enjoy the moment while still having pictures we can cherish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color Atlas has two parts which helped us realize our mission. The first is a
                    <a href="https://colormy.page" rel="nofollow">
                        webapp
                    </a>
                    which takes your location history from Google Takeout and generates coloring pages from locations you've been to in the past. The second is an motorized tricycle which follows you around and takes pictures of you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color My Page is built off of calls to Google Places to find images of locations from Google Takeout. We use OpenCV's Canny Edge Detector and Bilateral Filtering to generate coloring pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our motorized tricycle is built off of a small frame with outfitted motorized steering and propulsion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with file upload and downloads in the development of Color My Page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power distribution and keeping things low-profile was a difficulty in constructing the tricycle. Additionally, managing voltages with available hardware resources proved a challenging task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of achieving a multi-part project during our time available. We believe that Color Atlas can be enjoyed by many.
                </p>
