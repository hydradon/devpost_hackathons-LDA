                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of programmers suffer from carpal tunnel, usually from typing with bad wrist posture. Carpal tunnel is very painful and costs money to treat. Using the Myo arm band we can detect when posture is incorrect and send a vibration to the arms, reminding the user to correct their posture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The StressBand detects bad posture based on positioning and vibrates to tell the user to change it. In addition to this it also vibrates every hour to remind the user to take breaks.

                <p>
                    Myo Arm Band is not as sensitive as we once thought, it was hard getting it to detect bad posture.
