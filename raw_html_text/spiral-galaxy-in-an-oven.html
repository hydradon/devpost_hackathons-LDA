                    The original plan was to see how CMB cooling would effect the brightnesses of stars and looking at that effect in the luminosity of galaxies in motion!

                <p>
                    As the project continued, it became immediately apparent that the CMB had very minimal impact and we also realized that the galaxy simulation was taking foreverrr! So we switched focus and ended up building a fairly robust galaxy toy simulator!

                <p>
                    BEWARE!! This is not an N-Body simulation
