                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost every high school student has heard of the terror that is Powerschool. We decided to ease the stress that comes with facing it every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PowerBlocker is a Chrome extension that blocks Powerschool specifically for BCA students. It then redirects the student to several pages of relaxing (or meme-taining) activities.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trash jokes, dank memes, and stack overflow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially going to create an extension that blocked certain websites until you reached a certain GPA, but that proved to be too difficult for us mere beginners. So, we took a step back and created a simple blocker with a simple problem in mind.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did it. (Also our logo.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, API usage, more HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PowerBlocker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Counter, timer, better UI, hopefully that GPA tracking idea
                </p>
