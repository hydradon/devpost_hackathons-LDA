                    Our inspiration came from typing papers late into the night and waking up the next morning with ache-y wrists. And that's when it hit us. There has to be a better way. Standard keyboards can be great for fast and accurate typing, but  we are not all blessed with ten working fingers and two working wrists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we have created NEkey (pronounced "any key").
                </p>
                <p>
                    NEkey allows users to control both keyboard and mouse inputs using only a common video game controller. We achieved this by making two wheel menus around the joysticks. The left joystick selects the layer of different inputs while the right joystick is used to select and type the character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mouse controls are handled similarly, once the mouse control button is toggled the joysticks control the cursor. Primary and secondary click are handled through the bumper buttons on the controller.
