                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a small business, having a standing business phone number can be costly as well as a hassle to maintain. Especially since giving out your direct phone number isn't exactly what you might want to do. We set out to solve this with CallCenter for HipChat
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CallCenter for HipChat integrates with Twilio and allows a HipChat room owner to assign one (or multiple) phone numbers to a room. When a call comes in, it can be answered from directly inside the room or be go to voicemail. A discussion can then be had in the room and everyone can collaborate about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was build using the new awesome HipChat Connect framework that allows more integration with the HipChat client as well as the Twilio rest api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the bigger challenges that was run into was how to handle the "live" updating of the sidebar when it's displayed for a large audience while not causing a DoS attack on the service itself. We ended up creating a very protective caching layer within nginx that we're able to adjust as necessary. By doing this calls can appear in the sidebar "as live" items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. HipChat Connect opens a lot of interesting opportunities and the biggest challenge is to figure out how to best make use of the tooling provided by it.
