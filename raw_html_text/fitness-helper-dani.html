                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was trying to figure out what to do when I went to the gym during the week

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on what day it is at the gym (Legs, Back, Biceps, Triceps, Shoulders, etc) It will help you find the right exercises for that day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using swift I built an IOS app (built very loosely spoken) It was supposed to allow the user to click on what they wanted to work on. From there if would give a list of exercises that would allow the user to add them to their workout list and give them more specific instructions on the exercise if they click/press on it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few challenges, since I have never programmed in Swift before and learned everything from the internet and the tutorial. I ran into an error near the end when I was trying to connect two screens together, and I didn't have the time to work around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My teammates left early on in the day so I was required to problem solve and work alone on the code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to make a screen that you were able to interact with, and be able to code something in swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                <p>
                    To make it more functional and to get rid of the error. This code will probably be continued after some more research on Swift, since I really enjoyed the concept and coding it during the day.
