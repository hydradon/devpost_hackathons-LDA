                    An IoT project that uses RFC and BLE Beacon Technology on student IDs to track students during emergency/disaster situations and ease the process of their use of school equipment. What inspired my team to building this project was our interest in learning more about BLE beacon technology and using NFC technology. We were originally we going to use this technology for executive offices but found it would be much more useful for schools. We learned that beacon technology like this is fairly new and doesn't have much documentation on it and many outdated libraries so we struggled to implement this. However, one of our teammates was able to implement a smart lock with NFC technology that to act as a student checking into school with their ID. We were also able to create unique attributes for our Bluetooth module that mirror those of a student. Overall, the team as a whole gained much knowledge on both types of technology and spurred our interest to dive deeper into the research and implementation of both.
