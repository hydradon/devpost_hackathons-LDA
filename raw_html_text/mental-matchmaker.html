                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stigma behind mental health spans further than a college campus. Mental health is a taboo topic, but increasingly relevant, especially in environments that demand perfection as they do today. Fighting against this stigma and finding the right resources for you or your loved one -- these are the ways we can start helping ourselves, family, and friends. Find your mental health match today.

                    Connecting the back-end to the front-end is not as easy as it seems.

                    Once we can connect the back end to the front end correctly, this will be able to scale to other cities and states around the country using various scraping APIs. As for now, this is scaled to the Durham area.
