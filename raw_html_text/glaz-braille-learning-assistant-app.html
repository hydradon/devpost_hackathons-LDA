                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our first ever Hackathon, we were inspired by people who struggle to live and fully function in modern society, but yet try their best to succeed. Observing how difficult it might be to get knowledge for disabled people made us want to make learning more accessible for both adults and children. WE also liked the potential challenge of implementing features like speech recognition and a user-friendly layout that can be learned intuitively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app displays a 3x2 grid matching up to braille characters where the would be pips are areas that would cause the phone to vibrate, allowing people with vision impairments to learn the braille alphabet through a more technology-based way. The app also recognizes voice commands to ease between the transition of screens, and options for those with a vision disability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio was the main platform to implement out knowledge of java, and application design for Android devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program breaking every 0.35 ms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making the interface extremely use friendly, as it was the main challenge considering the target audience is blind people, who would have a hard time navigating through an app with a ton of features. Yet, our application is still functional and useful in spite if its apparent simplicity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned the basics of android app development and deployment, as well as the basis of speech to text recognition, and the importance of not losing tempo, especially when working on a tight deadline. We both also gained a significant amount of practice in java, as it had been a while since either of us had touched it, and only one of us had used android studio before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Glaz, the braille learning assistant app.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better looking UI to make the app seem more professional could be added if more time is put into this.
