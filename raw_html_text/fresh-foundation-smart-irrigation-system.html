                    Severe droughts can often cause severe damage to foundations of homes. Our inspiration for this project was to tackle these issues faced by homeowners in an efficient manner. We have implemented a smart irrigation system that measures moisture content and the shifting of foundations in various locations. To prove feasibility, we have programmed an arduino to collect live data from the environment using a soil moisture sensor, thermal probe, and a flex sensor. We have also created a 3D CAD model of the device and have designed various features to improve functionality. Due to our relatively new experience to arduino software, we were unable to fully integrate the collected data with the GUI interface. Nonetheless, we were able to collect data and prove functionality and calculations or the smart system. We are very proud that our team was able to implement both software and hardware design to provide a more in-depth solution. We have learned much about soil properties and how they influence the environment. We look forward to receiving feedback on our potential solution and our designed prototype.
