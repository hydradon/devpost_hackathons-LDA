                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent events have made people more politically involved and active, but it is still hard for many people to get the information they need in order to vote on the person they think is right. We wanted to create an easy to read and easy to understand view of information about representatives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives information about representatives in terms of office, party, contact information, etc. in a more bite sized way so that it is easier for the average citizen to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the app in Android Studio.

                <h2>

                <p>
                    The question of how local or federal we go with the search results for politicians.
                </p>
