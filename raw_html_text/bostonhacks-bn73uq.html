                <p>
                    Genghis Coin makes predictions of relative maxima and minima of prices by generating a formula through Newton-Gaussian Algorithm and makes trades accordingly. This utility has a Twilio interface, that allows the user to receive live notifications via text about the bot's performance and drastic changes in the market.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    There were a large number of obstacles we needed to overcome for this project. Designing the algorithm, and finding the right back end data took majority of the first 15 hours. On top of this, fixing Flask and the HTML/CSS pages was very frustrating
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Future of Genghis Coin
                </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In future iterations of this project, we plan to add AI for optimizing the decision of whether or not we should place buy and sell orders given our knowledge of the market using Tensorflow. Furthermore, by implementing Wit.ai for natural language processing we can improve the experience of our users. Future versions of this platform would allow users to simply invest in a bot, and see their money grow through our graphical analysis. As of now, this utility only trades cryptocurrency's but it can easily use the same math to trade stocks, and any other markets. A final form of our bot would trade with multiple different stocks simultaneously, and would use AI to predict function types for datasets.
