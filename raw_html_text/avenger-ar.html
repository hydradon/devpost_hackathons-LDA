                    Basically when i heard about about t,i really want to his challenge i was pretty excited i really wanted to develop something entertaining so i decided to work on spark ar because i love augmented reality .I have many ideas regarding augmented reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what this project does is it superimpose avengers movie character on user's face .I thought it was a good idea because people are mad about avengers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built it using facebook tool Spark AR that has features like face detection and hand gesture detection that are easy to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was hard to superimpose the mask and adjust the mask on a moving head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am just happy because i completed it because winning and loosing are just a part of life but doing the thing with passion and hardwork is really important. So i am happy that i completed my task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot by developing it ,now i became familiar with spark ar framework and as i am a facebook developer facilitator now i want to learn more about it and teach everyone about this tool because its very easy to use this tool
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to introduce more characters with some effects this time like thor helmet with his lightning eye and lightning effect in the background etc.
                </p>
