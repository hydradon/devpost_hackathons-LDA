                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swamped with homework, students are always staying up way too late and getting up way too early, us included. A common solution to the plaguing exhaustion resulting from these schedules is caffeinated drinks. However, we're also aware of the negative effects of consuming too much caffeine. Although our app isn't 100% accurate, with a little more polishing, we could add more fields for users to enter their weight and calculate with some amount of tolerance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically created a simple and animated version of a caffeine calculator. Users can enter the number of hours they want to stay up for, and our calculations will give them the approx number of cups needed to stay awake. The calculation is assuming the cups not taken continuously and rather intermittently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this all on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I drew the background art, and Katrina did the cup and animation for the coffee mug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time learning how to do keyframe animation. A lot of time was also spent learning to delay animations and filling and formatting the page correctly. Thank you, mentors, for helping us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a bit of help, we were able to get each cup of coffee to fill up based on an amount calculated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both learned a lot about javascript and how to add animation and functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Caffeinate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand to tea and be more precise when calculating the number of cups. Because there are many factors that go into how long you can stay awake, we didn't take any of them into account. For example, people can grow intolerant to caffeine. Different coffees can have different amounts of caffeine. Weight will also affect the metabolism of caffeine in the body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    About the Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a beginner to coding and hackathons, Katrina spent a lot of her time learning from wiki pages and tutorials to create this project. Tiffany, on the other hand, has hackathon experience but had very little webdev and javascript experience. Along with the help of mentors, they were able to decipher and understand different concepts and apply them to this project.
