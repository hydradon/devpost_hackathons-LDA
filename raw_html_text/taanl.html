                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually tried to build something like this a few years ago but it was just a somewhat clumsy console application. This time I wanted to go further and build something with actual usability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to use multiple chat services in one web-based client, as well as providing a solid API which allows for the application to integrate any other chat service as long as the hooks are implemented, as well as allowing the experience for each chat service to be individually customized and specialized for that service's needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Persistent effort and a lot of work packed into a relatively small amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea how to use Vue before this project, so fighting with its reactful object system was pretty rough. Also, both the Discord and Slack APIs wanted to use Node.JS features (which are not available on the browser), so I had to go and manually remove some code to get errors to go away and the type checker to stop complaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While TaaNL clearly has room to grow in terms of usability, I'm impressed with how much I managed to accomplish with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of how to use Vue, a bit more about the crazy world of web frameworks.
