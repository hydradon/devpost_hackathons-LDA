                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why do we hack? To solve problems. We start with a goal, and test our ideas to solve a problem. We start with a brainstorm - we deliberate over our ideas, each of us trying to explain the design, discussing the pros and cons. Post-it notes on a wall, scribbles on a sheet of paper, markers on a whiteboard, but in the end it's hard for everyone to voice their ideas and most of our notes are illegible gibberish. As we build, designs get revised, we continuously go back to the drawing board, repeating this process countless times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideas get lost, reasoning behind decisions are forgotten, we lose focus, and a seemingly easy project can get held up by the smallest obstacles.
                    <strong>
                        But now, we present to you OnBoard.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        OnBoard brings your ideas to the front
                    </strong>
                    , allowing you and your team to easily focus on your design and manage your workflow. Get OnBoard with your team, and be able to share visual concepts, clearly explain your thoughts, and be able to bounce ideas off of your team members. Most of all,
                    <strong>
                        OnBoard puts the most important ideas first
                    </strong>
                    . Pinned cards with discussion threads ensure that the biggest design decisions do not get lost. Chat connects group members instantly, allowing for seamless communication. Draw out your design and explain each component, allowing members to visualize and build on ideas. Arrange boards in your workflow as your project evolves.
                    <strong>
                        OnBoard lets you take your ideas and collaborate.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OnBoard is an HTML5 website, powered by Javascript. Drawing functionality is through JQuery and Javascript&rsquo;s canvas.We use Reactjs as our view library in conjunction with redux to manage the application state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OnBoards creation was slowed by not having a discussion forum that could effectively manage ideas and make our workflow efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of our whiteboard functionality and our discussion threads. By Getting OnBoard, you can use these to optimize your design process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on OnBoard taught us to value the design process. As we thought which functions would be most useful to teams, we were able to apply a lot of these ideas and guidelines to our own development. On the more technical side, we learned how to apply node packages and JS libraries. We gained insight on the most intuitive UI and UX, and we hope that this is evident in your experience with OnBoard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OnBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OnBoard endeavours to continue making discussions more intuitive for groups. Additional functionality like a Kanban board, and the ability to join multiple groups will be added.
