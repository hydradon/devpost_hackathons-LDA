                    A complete blood count is a test which can be used to evaluate your overall health and can detect a wide range of disorders such as sickle cell anemia, infection, leukemia, and other conditions. Generally this is done in a lab with trained professionals and expensive microscopes, but such resources are not as readily available in third world countries. With our app and a $1 microscope known as the

                    , anybody can turn their phone into a powerful diagnostic device capable of providing early warnings for more serious conditions.

                    Blood Analyst is an Android app that takes in an image of a blood microscopy sample and uses OpenCV to count the cells seen under a microscope sample. It then shows statistics about the image to allow further analysis of the results.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and OpenCV to build this project. And lots of Stackoverflow

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first big challenge for everybody was getting started. For those who were working on OpenCV, that involved getting libraries to work in Java. The other team members who worked with Android Studio had a learning curve to climb as well, since all of us were new to Android development.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our algorithms to detect the cells was a big step for us as it meant actual progress in our image processing algorithms.

                    What's next for Blood Analyst
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to allow Blood Analyst to test for more cases of blood abnormalities. This would require Blood Analyst to detect different shapes and types of cells. Once we have this information, we can tell the user suggestions based on the information, thus automating the diagnostic process.
