                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When students leave a library late at night, they may walk home alone even though they feel unsafe. They don't want to be bothersome to their friends by asking them to walk them home. Beacon is intended to pair students with one another so that they feel safe walking home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students indicate when they wish to leave their location, and when another student who is nearby has the same preferences, they get paired together. The app allows students to match with only those of their gender, and is restricted to UVA students only to reduce misuse by community members.
