                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first year Georgia Tech students, we have experienced how chaotic GaTech can be. There are many assignments and even more interesting organizations to join. So, trying to manage all this can be extremely difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a to-do list of assignments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Alexa developer console to program traits for Alexa to follow using python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. This was our first time working on a goal-oriented project. We faced many errors which definitely showed us the importance of debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to get Alexa to follow the structure we wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the process and how to use the Alexa developer console. In general, we had the chance to learn a lot about how Alexa works and how we can play a role.

                    What's next for Buzz Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to keep broadening Buzz Buddy by adding motivational quotes and tips to keep focus. We also plan to create a separate category for social events.
