                    To become a better student, two big areas of improvement are
                    <strong>
                        active listening
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        effective note taking
                    </strong>
                    . Our solution
                    <strong>
                        saves time
                    </strong>
                    while note-taking,
                    <strong>
                        increases focus
                    </strong>
                    while listening, and
                    <strong>
                        grabs information
                    </strong>
                    for later studying.

                <p>
                    Students spend too long making notes and not enough time processing the information. Students say they will research a particular concept and add information to their notes but they forget. Students often get disconnected with professors during lectures because they are too busy writing.

                    Notar.ai is built based on the best note-taking methodology as proposed by Stanford University, called The Cornell Method. While in lecture, our user can write very brief notes about a concept and let our tool research and add detailed information from the internet to the notes. Add a concept or Click the Notar.ai button.

                    Using Material Design as the basis for our Tool, we decided to go with Angular 6 to support it. We have also used Google Cloud Technologies such as Firebase for database and Stdlib for REST. We have also made use of API's such as Google's Custom Search Api tools.

                    Design is one of our philosophies and we built our app using Google's Material Design Guidelines.

                    We want to be main spot for students and researchers to write notes. The way to do that will be to index and grab data from every website possible (with their permission) to provide more data to users. In future, we will be using Solr web indexing tools and Google App Engine and Goolgle VMs to help us monitor the web for more content.
