                    Inspiration: The need to get someone's attention urgently
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Gets the attention of your friends and family, even if their phone is on silent. This app will notify your friends and family if there is something urgent going on, and you can personally "push" an alert on their mobile device. Only people you have added on your friend's list have the permission to sent an alert to you!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built it with the help of the Parse API using swift and xCode. Other APIs from Apple was also used.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: It was very difficult creating a database to store the user's information. We also had trouble getting push notification to work and how to bypass the user's silent settings.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am proud that I was about o create a working mock up of the App in as little as two days with the help of my amazing teammates!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned how great it is to work in a group with others, to share our ideas, and to collaborate with others to accomplish a shared goal.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Instalert: To make a better user interface. There are still some bugs that needs to be taken care of. In the future, we would like to market and expand our app to many people. Advertising and making the App better in general will benefit our small company.
