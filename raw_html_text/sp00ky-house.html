                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our childhood love of escape games.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a fun text-based escape game.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the basic knowledge of Java that we picked up in our first-year engineering Programming class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to discover how to individually collaborate on a single project, by creating a thorough plan, splitting the project into individual pieces that could be patched up into one, and communicating everyone's intentions and modifications so that we can adjust as we go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game that begins, ends, and allows the user to explore the house and solve short and creative puzzles. As well, we were able to collectively craft a narrative as we built and designed the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaborating with a team is stressful and extremely difficult. Not everyone inherently understands your vision for the project, and it can be frustrating when you have to go back and make edits because two visions clashed. But a team is also one of the more efficient and effective ways of building a project because multiple people can tackle multiple problems simultaneously. Teammates also allow for more diversity in brainstorming and inspiration, as everyone has different experiences and ideas. Additionally, time constraints are frustrating because there is always more you can add and improve on, but they are also motivating because you know you only have a certain amount of time to present your absolute best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SP00KY HOUSE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are still many functions that would be nice to add to the game, such as allowing the user to explore freely between all rooms, even after the puzzles have been solved, or adding elements of puzzles into other rooms to encourage more complexity and exploration. It would also be ideal to learn how to move the game into a window platform and create an executable file so that the game can run outside of Eclipse and possibly involve visuals (such as a backpack to keep track of items in your inventory, or a map of the house as you explore it).
