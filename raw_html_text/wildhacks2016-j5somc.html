                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our inspiration for this app when we realized that many restaurants were struggling with their business due to poor customer service reviews. These reviews were often due to long wait times for customers and we saw that the lack of proper communication between customers and employees often led to these long wait times. We knew immediately that a technological application could be implemented to improve the customer service and wait times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides restaurants with the ability to keep track of their customers efficiently while also allowing customers to keep track of their orders. For the restaurants, the app allows them to create Resto-View accounts and to create a waitlist that customers can view as well but can't modify. The restaurant will be able to add customers to the waitlist along with their order number and a estimate of how long their food will take to arrive. Once a customer has been served, their name will be removed from the queue. Furthermore, customers will be able to view where they are in line and this gives them the flexibility to come back later or at least be aware of when their food will arrive. Most importantly, this app should provide restaurants with a proper means for keeping track of their customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build this app utilizing Java and XML for design. Achintya and I worked mainly on the design of each Activity within the app. Abdul focused on the data models that our app uses to store Orders the waiting list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of WildHacks, Achintya and I had no experience in Android Development or with Android Studio, so we had to watch tutorials and practice with simple apps to understand XML, Intents, as well as OnClickListeners. After we were able to get started, our 2 biggest challenges were to implement the ListView on the RestList.java class because we wanted to implement a custom ListView row with 3 TextViews and an ImageView. We also had trouble with multithreading and using that to get the countdown for the time for each order, but we were eventually able to figure it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning many of the concepts related to Android Development and applying them in a short period of time, especially understanding how to use Intents to switch Activities and transfer data between Activities. We also are proud of being able to implement multithreading to get the countdown timer because that was initially a difficult concept for us to understand and implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us learned a lot about using Android Studio, designing the UI with XML, and transitioning activities as well as passing data between activities by using Intents. We also learned how to use multithreading through the countdown timer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resta-View
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to develop the customer view side of the application so customers can view their position in the line and gain an idea of approximately when their food will be served. Also, we would like to improve the design of the app to make it more responsive and intuitive to use for the user.
