                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game inspired by a similar game we played on a group trip to Ocean City last May.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pokereno is an electro-mechanical arcade game where players roll 5 raquetballs in sequence down a ramp to score the highest poker hand possible. Our pokereno design includes coin/token validation, LED game state display, and ticket dispensing.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The mechanical build was constructed out of wood at the hackathon, including a counterbalanced mechanism for returning the balls at the start of a new game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The electronic components are controlled by a raspberry pi
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It was difficult to construct the multiplexed IO circuits without bugs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hardware took a long time to develop, even after plans were drawn up. Deviations from the mechanical design were extremely more difficult to compensate for the later into the build they started.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Multiplexed I/O mechanism that allows up to 64 digital inputs/outputs with just 2 GPIO pins on the Raspberry PI
