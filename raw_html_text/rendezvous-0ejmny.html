                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After getting lost in a city while being part of a larger group, we thought that it would be convenient to be able to track everyone's location even after we split up.  This would better facilitate meeting back together, especially when a meeting place is ill-defined or nonexistent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Members of a group can join a virtual room on the server.  The room keeps track of the locations of the members and relays this information to each user.  Users are labeled by display names, and each room is separately tracked from each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python's Flask library to create a server that integrates HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A SQL database was used to keep log and store each user's location. We utilized the geolocation capability of web browsers to pinpoint each user's location, and Google's maps to display the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating an SQL database was quite difficult.
                </p>

                    What's next for Rendezvous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many possible functionalities that can be added to this project, such as room security, or better support for mobile devices (mobile devices work, but the interface is slightly clunky).
