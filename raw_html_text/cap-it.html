                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of college students, we know the struggle of trying to save money. Rather than using a budgeting app, why not have your bank automatically watch your funds for you?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app analyzes your past spending at the beginning of every month, and determines how much money should be kept in your debit and how much should be transferred to your savings. At the end of each month, you are alerted through SMS about whether you've met your savings goal, as well as the amount you have saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Nessie, Capital One's API, we were able to track account activities. We used that information to determine the amount of money that users should have stored in their checking account, while we transfer the rest to their savings using the API. Our Node.js server schedules the monthly transfers, while we integrated Twilio in order to send SMS notifications to our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary challenge that we had to deal with was the difficulty in working with proper bank data, as the test data we had was manually generated and insufficient for an in-depth analysis. Due to the constraints on this data, we were also unable to set up a proper mock accounts for further testing, also giving us a very limited scope for demoing. We also ran out of time while assessing issues connecting back-end to front-end; while our script runs properly server-side, the client-side implementation is incomplete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with and incorporate two tools we've never used before, Nessie and Twilio. We were also able to sharpen our skills in general node/web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cap-It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to incorporate additional management features such as credit-card caps that prevent users from spending more than they have in their checking, as well as further customization on their monthly savings.
