                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to make a game that taught about STEM, while still being fun and interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The object of the game is to find a secret code hidden in the site by finding the answers to questions
First, a question list is selected from the main page
Then one can browse the other pages to find the answers
Each of the picture answers, when clicked on, link to the wikipedia page for that thing.
The pages are marked with letters, so the letter of the page the answer is on is what corresponds to the number of the question.
After all of the answers have been found, a phrase is spelled out, which can be entered to complete the puzzle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, the three of us, as STEM interested students, tried to use what we&rsquo;re interested in to get others interested.
We came up with:
Design and Art
Trivia
Wikipedia
To create the website itself we used our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the site do what we wanted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some features that we wanted to add that didn't work even after hours of trying, including trying to animate objects inside the webpage, so we added other features instead, such as interesting win graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the art and the design, as well as the overall concept of the game. We are also proud of the work that we put into making the website interesting and well formatted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use our knowledge of website building that we hadn't used in a while, as well as learning new concepts, such as using CSS for design and formatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEM Scavenger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This site is not completely finished, considering the time frame we were given, but could easily be expanded.
For the pages, instead of putting pictures on a white background, we could spend more time designing the layout, and make the game more intriguing to younger players.
Questions lists could be randomly generated from an external text file to give players more chances to play the game.
The overall user interface could also be more interactive, so the website would be more responsive to the actions of the player, from using audio files to making a more user driven gameplay with selections throughout the game.
