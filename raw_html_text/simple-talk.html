                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Recent Studies have shown that almost half of all Americans have trouble obtaining, understanding or acting on information that is important to their health
*Patients with limited health literacy tend to be in poorer health, partake less frequently of preventative health measures and screenings, and become hospitalized more frequently, resulting in an estimated annual cost of $50-$73 billion
*Elderly patients with limited  health literacy are almost twice as likely to die
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts audio to text. Then simplifies the complex medical terminology to layman's terms in order to give the patient a better understanding of the physicians dialogue.

                    </strong>
                    = converting audio to text using IBM-Watson
                    <strong>
                        Stage 2
                    </strong>
                    = Simplifying the medical jargon using Python code that called on a dictionary list of medical terminology and their synonyms
                    <strong>
                        Stage 3
                    </strong>
                    = Further simplification of the phrases using NLP techniques
                </p>
