                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flyers.ai wants to rid the world of physical paper flyers. You know, Those pesky things you find on your car windshield, or sandwiched in an unexpected place? A paperless workflow would allow for a much more modern way of advertising while acquiring concrete and actionable field data. 
Traditionally, flyers marketing has been used by individuals and corporations alike to promote products, services, events or other initiatives. The common factor is that these promotions always serve to make consumers aware of a new offering. Because they are used for promotion, the information contained in them is intended to bring some impact on consumer behavior towards the product or service being promoted. 
Like any other tool of marketing, traditional flyers have advantages and disadvantages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Flyers are easily read and graphical in nature
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flyers are cheap to produce and easy to distribute 
Flyers marketing are also disadvantageous to some extent and the following are some of its setbacks;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flyers are easily dismissed by consumers due to their simple nature, many people don&rsquo;t even read the information contained in the flyers or they will read it for few seconds then throw them away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is little feedback; when distributing flyers, there is a limited face-to-face interaction between the marketer and the consumer, if any. As marketers try to distribute

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flyers.ai leverages the Ethereum Blockchain to help promoters get paid fairly for their referrals. It also helps businesses go green but not printing physical paper flyers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a frontend for users to be able to easily search, discover and attend curated events happening around them. The backend allows for business to easily add bounties to get their venues filled and to reward curators for referring patrons to their establishments.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Wifi was not working very well during the entire hackathon. It really made it really challenging for our team to work
at the Hacakthon Venue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our accomplishment is to have built a working prototype on a fairly young and unproven technology. Solidity is a difficult language to master, but we believe that we built the minimal viable MVP within the allotted time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team. We also learned how to overcome challenges like spotty Wifi connections and leverage our own resources
