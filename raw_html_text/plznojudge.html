                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to make a cool game, and we thought this implemented many cool ideas within the code, even though these complexities may not be reflected in the gameplay experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game, the player fights an army of squares, gaining upgrades as they struggle to survive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it from the ground up, first starting with basic display, adding logic later, and finally tweaking it by adding things like upgrades and AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    git push -f, and coming up with good ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game contains multiple threads, as well as a complex class hierarchy, to create a top down two dimensional screen scrolling shooter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned valuable new techniques for programming, and tried to use software like hasuro before the project was migrated to an all java code base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tanks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the game into another dimension, by using Axiom&trade; engine to render the game in an efficient way, while adding more challenge in the game itself.  We also hope to find a way to put the game entirely online.
