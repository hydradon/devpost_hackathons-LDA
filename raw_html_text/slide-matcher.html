                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is the hardship that we felt before the exam night. Fortunately, USC tries very hard to help the students using DEN and make sure everyone can study at their own pace and also can revise at the time of exams. We also get slides for the lectures. But, often times neither alone is sufficient. With slides, we can refer to information very quickly but it could be too dense to interpret without explanation. On the other hand, videos are quite helpful in understanding stuff but can also take hours to parse through. It would be great if we have something by which we can fully integrate visual and auditory learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slide Matcher is a double-sided mapping between DEN videos and lecture slides to allow seamless transition between the two. We can watch a few slides on our own and when the material gets a little dense we can switch instantly to the exact point in the video where the same concept is being explained. It allows students to navigate between their own class notes, lecture slides and videos with a single click on this platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected our data by extracting all the lecture slides with PyPDF and high entropy frames from the video using PySceneDetect. After extraction, we ran our matching algorithm which uses Structural Similarity to see how closely each of the frames matches up with slides using Image processing and audio analysis. Using this performance matrix, we identify the optimum video frame for each of the slide using OpenCV and Scikit-image with more than 90% confidence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Performance of the whole system depends on the accuracy of mapping between video and slides. Often times, videos don&rsquo;t have a great capture of the slides and hence it&rsquo;s difficult to integrate both the things. We tried solving the problem of integration using OCR at first, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to reach the accuracy that we were expecting. We tried image processing and it gave decent results. We thought if we can use audio searching with image processing, we might get better results. But audio searching was the most difficult part. We needed to make a transcribe file and do text matching with the OCR of frames. Optimizing this and making it look good with ease of use was also challenging. We also struggled to work with so many libraries with sometimes very few or comparatively less documentation.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a decent prototype of what we have imagined connecting two things. We also built a seamless front end that looks decent and minimalistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely had issues working with multiple libraries to accomplish our tasks, bad documentation, fix bugs in shorter time, but we powered through together.
