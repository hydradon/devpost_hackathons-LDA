                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew inspiration from classic fighting games such as Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros. for the overall core, as well as the concept of "button mashing". Button mashing is the idea that players simply press as many random buttons as possible to win the game. We decided to take this concept and turn it into a typing game that involves trying to press random buttons on the keyboard as fast as possible to simulate this "button mashing" and create a fun, competitive game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ButtonMashers is a fighting/typing game that requires speed as well as reflexes to beat your opponent. Each player is required to type specific, automatically generated random keys displayed on the screen to decimate their opponent. The first person to accurately type fifty keys wins!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is written primarily in Python, using the Pygame library to easily prototype basic game functions and elements. We used Sublime Text as the text editor, as Sublime can be used to easily compile a wide variety of code languages. Graphics were primarily created in Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early into the development of the game, we found that the git repository we set up was not functioning correctly. This made it difficult to share the files between us and keep track of individual changes that each of us made. We decided to eventually abandon git to focus on completing the game overall. Although sharing files as a result became clunky and troublesome, we were able to effectively delegate tasks for each team member and finish a polished version of ButtonMashers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of developing and laying out our ideas on a detailed level that allowed us to proceed confidently with our game design. Completing the overall structure of the game to be polished as possible was something to be proud of, as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the ins and outs of PyGame, as well as how to design an effective game with fun mechanics. We learned how to delegate tasks to various team members as well as streamline the design process overall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ButtonMashers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further refining and developing the game to have more polished elements is a definite goal for the future of ButtonMashers. Making different characters for the players to chose from would be an interesting feature overall. Adding different, more fun mechanics, such as special moves or such would also increase the challenge/strategy of the overall game. In order to further expand the scope of ButtonMashers, changing the overall structure from PyGame to something like GameMaker would probably be necessary.
