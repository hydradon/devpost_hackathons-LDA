                    Currently, we see that developed countries have a hard time helping victims of domestic violence. Fortunately, smart phone devices have made it a lot easier, people are able to look up, for example, &ldquo;What do I do if I am being abused?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I help a friend who does not know that they are being abused?&rdquo;. However, people in developing countries, do not have access to smartphones and sometimes do not even realize that they are experiencing abuse. This means they are unable to look up how to find help. This is why we created a SMS solution and a simple website called Help140.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Help140 sends SMS tips to friends and family members who are concerned about a victim. Our SMS solution is built to help a victim or the friend of a victim. If a victim contacts our SMS solution they are put in direct contact with a counsellor who will help them work through their issues. If the friend or family member of a victim contacts our SMS solution, they are given direct steps on how to communicate with the victim in a loving, supporting nature. No matter what, we want the victim to feel safe talking to their friends or family members about what is going on. We also provide a conference call with a counselor. This means the friend, the victim and the counselor can all be on the phone at the same time together.
