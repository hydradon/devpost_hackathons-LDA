                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DnD is a fun, imagintive game that relies on the use of a character sheet to record information for adventures. However, game times can be long due to the constant erasing and searching of character information in the books. In order to simplify the game and ease the process of playing, an android app will be used to perform calculations and keep track of character information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses an authentication system and stores user data into a database in Firebase. This information includes player's stats and items. Java was used to create methods to ease calculations, like loss of hit points or the addition of character spells.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android Studio and supported it with Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overestimating the learning curve of github, additionally, we failed a project before this and had to switch to this simpler concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In less than 24 hours, we created an app that can be used by DnD players to make tabletop games more efficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better understanding of git and github which allowed us to work more effectively as a team. Additionally, we learned how to use tools like Firebase to reduce the time needed to code.

                <p>
                    We'll continue to add touches to the app. Implementing the methods that perform calculations will be first, then we will move into allows characters to roll dice and perform other actions while the dungeon master has their own hidden rolls, eventually creating a much simpler and faster way to play Dungeons and Dragons.
