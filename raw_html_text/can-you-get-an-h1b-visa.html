                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the recent turbulence surrounding the changing political climate on immigration we thought that an app that helped determine the probability of one being eligible for H-1B visa would be useful. This app would help employers as well as people who want to know their chances for being eligible for an H-1B visa.

                    Calculates the probability a certain employee's LCA application will be approved by the Department of Labor.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app asks for the data specific to a prospective employee that a company wants to hire. Using the training data of past employers and their LCA applications given by the Department of Labor on their website (

                    </a>
                    ), we optimize a machine learning algorithm that will determine whether or not a particular employee's LCA application will be approved.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android development and connecting the front end and back end were new tasks for us and created many setbacks along the way. Training the machine learning algorithm also proved difficult as due to unbalanced data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an app with real world value, learning how to navigate the cloud, creating an app, and leveraging machine learning were things that we had little to no experience with--mostly no experience--but are things that we learned to do in our first hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the cloud, create and app, and accurately leverage a machine learning algorithm.

                <p>
                    The UI could use quite a bit of improvements and we need to make the front and back end communicate instantaneously.
