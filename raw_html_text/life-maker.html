                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members was found to have no drive or passion in life. Thus, we decided to build him a life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an Android app that generates a new identity for the user, including a new name, a new social security number, 3 things that they are passionate in life about, and also an activity that they must strive to do. Then, it creates 4 stats based on the 3 passions that were randomly chosen. Then the app tells you whether you will succeed in your activity depending on one or two selected stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to create the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any ideas for apps. We wanted to make a game at first, but then we realized that we did not have the prerequisite skill or any ideas for what game to make. Thus, we decided to create this app, incorporating many game elements within as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our longest switch statement was more than 1500 lines of code, due to the many statements that we had to add in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Life Maker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add to the switch statement, and also make a fully functioning text based RPG.
