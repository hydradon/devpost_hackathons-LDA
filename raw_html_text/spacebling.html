                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were shocked to know that astronauts face medical difficulties due to harmful effects of solar radiations in space. Then, we got to know that earth's magnetic field has formed a shelter to protect us from radiations. Similar process is also happening in case of white swirls on surface of moon that is due to weak magnetic field. 
Also, we saw a news about limiting of women in space by NASA due to bad size fitting of spacesuit for them. The cost of spacesuits is also very high.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This kind of spacesuit protects the astronauts from radiations and it is customizable so that women can get spacesuit of their size. Currently, we have built a small example prototype (glove) and we have built a working e-commerce website through which customers can get their customized spacesuit at a lower price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a small and cheap battery in neoprene and spandex glove to produce a weak magnetic field which will create a shelter similar to the idea of white swirls on moon. Then, we used coding in Javascript, html, css, git, aws-lambda and webgl to create an e-commerce website for customized spacesuits. We also used Blender to create 3D models of spacesuits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any equipment/resources in the beginning to accomplish this project. We did not have any facilities to create a prototype for a full spacesuit. We had to think a lot about how to make the glove wearable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to complete working website. We successfully made a wearable glove which can protect us from radiations. We are solving problem for all astronauts including women who deserve going to space.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to speed-up the accomplishment of a project by teamwork. We learned additive manufacturing, wearable materials for spacesuits, 3D models etc.
                </p>

                    What's next for SpaceBling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to successfully launch a product which can help astronauts and also promote NASA's ISS tourism mission.
