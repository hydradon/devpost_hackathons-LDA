                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We procrastinate on our computer science assignments because we are always on Twitter. We realized we aren't the only people struggling to stay on track with their school work. We decided to make a bot that combines both social media and reminder notifications together to keep students on track with their schedules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can send a tweet tagging the bot. The tweet includes a custom reminder message and the amount of time the user wants to be tweeted back. The bot will immediately respond back to the user with a confirmation tweet of the task to be completed. After the amount of time mentioned in the user's tweet has passed, then the bot sends the reminder tweet and likes the message. Liking the message prevents it from sending repeated messages to the same tweet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and a Twitter API to develop this program. In addition, we used a Twitter library named "tweepy" to create an automated Twitter account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to parse the tweet for significant inputs such as time frame and the tasks given. Another challenge we ran into was keeping the bot online without crashing.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are accomplished to successfully complete our first project outside of academic assignments. We are also proud of how much we learned in a short amount of time and applied those skills to a working project in our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in Python and use APIs for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remind me, bot!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to handle ambiguous inputs better and perfect our algorithm for searching through relevant tweets.
