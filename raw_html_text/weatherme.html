                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about apps that we use every day, that are simple in design but well-made and useful. We came upon the idea of an app that helped you get ready in the morning more easily, especially for children: when they are still learning what degrees mean and how to dress, a visual animation of what they should wear could be helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Android App asks you on its home page what city you are currently in, and will search a weather API and extract weather data from it to display in a more readable version for the user. Then, the next screen displays an animation of a suggested outfit for them that day based on the conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Flutter API to make an app based towards user experiences, used a weather API to extract data into the program, and used Marvelous Designer to make 3D models of outfits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing the new software, and especially learning how to program in the Dart programming language, which was unlike anything we had ever seen before, proved to be quite the challenge. The "Widget" system had a steep learning curve, but we came to appreciate the utility by the end of the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a working model of our app, that was able to produce the weather of any city we could think of and pair it with one of our 3D models. We also think the app looks organized and accessible, especially for having been made in under a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a big leap into app development and Dart, as well as 3D design, and came out with a good understanding of the basics. Most of our team members were at their first hackathon, so we had to learn a lot of things that others might take for granted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeatherMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeatherMe has a lot of potential in the adding of outfits, especially customized based upon the user's wardrobe and preferences, and can be deployed to IOS and Android very easily for immediate use. We can also add more weather features, generate tips for the day based on factors like fog or hail, and add more UI components to make it even smoother.
