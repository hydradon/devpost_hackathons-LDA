                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is a simple way to give our senators and representatives exactly what they asked for: our internet history. In response to the Senate Joint Resolution 34, our chrome extension works to inconvenience our politicians by flooding their twitter feed with various internet search histories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At every click of the extension icon, the user is prompted with a window to send a tweet composed of their current url and a tag to a randomly generated senator or representative that voted for the resolution. We intend for this to inconvenience the twitter feeds of politicians and raise awareness to the resolution itself.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our extension is based mostly off of the standard chrome extension format. HTML and CSS run our popup menus and Javascript handles our process of sending tweets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble utilizing the Twitter API to automate posts and maximize our load on receiving twitter feeds. One of our greatest challenges were dealing with out of date and vague documentation on cookies, APIs, etc. Last but not least, STAYING AWAKE.

                    Find a better way to utilize certain APIs and maximize our footprint on twitter feeds. This can possibly translate to future issues that need greater awareness.
