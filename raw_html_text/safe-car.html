                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was two different groups, other members of each team walked away giving up, so we got together and put our ideas until we thought of this idea. We thought of how it is very unsafe for someone to try to drive while it is too hot in their car. They could faint and cause an accident, or even worth death. The idea began small and we started to expand it more and more. The team kept pushing over the limits to keep going even when it was a small project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an Arduino uno that uses two different color led lights, Buzzer, button and temperature sensor. The main idea is when you enter a car on a very hot day, you can breeze in the air easily. Our project determines the temperature inside the car. If the temperature is too hot, then the Buzzer will go off. At this point you have three options, you can go outside the car and wait for it to cool down, you can press a button that will put your windows down and whenever you would like to test it then you press the rest button, or you can press the button and shut it off and the windows will go down and whenever you would like to reset you press the reset button. (another option is having the buzzer beeping while you drive)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Ardunio uno as the main brain of the whole operation. Also we used the temperature sensor, buzzer, two different color and button that were connected to the base shield. Using the Arduino program to code it (C++)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problems we faced was that we couldn't get the buzzer to stop buzzing once we pressed the button to stop the buzzer. The issue with our code was that once the button was held down(by declaring it as 1) it would stop the buzzer, but the main problem was that once the button was released it was set back to 0 once again and continue its buzzing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were finally able to get the button to work where it would require you to just press the button to once instead of holding it throughout the time it would take to cool down. How we fixed that specific issue was the we were able to once the buzzer was declared as 1

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to use the hardware of arduino, which we had no experience what so ever, as well as working with different piece of arduino that required different codes.

                    What's next for Safe Car
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work with a car to try to put the windows down. Also, for cars with remote starters we can have a raspberry pie to connect to your phone through bluetooth or wifi to tell you if your car is cooled down. As well as running the A/c while the windows are closed.
