                    Above is the zip file for our game, Devpost wouldn't let us submit it for some reason.

                    With almost all beginner programmers and most of our first hackathons, we all decided that naturally, being so new, the best course of action was to explore Virtual Reality, which none of us knew. We then created a game in Unity, a game engine that half of the team didn't know. Our game prompts the user with a series of questions that have to do with real life decisions. The user (our target audience is women) then chooses a cloud which would represent what they have done in their life. The goal of our project was to empower women by telling them that they should be confident in the choices they make in life.
