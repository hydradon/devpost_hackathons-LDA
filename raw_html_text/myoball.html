                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started playing with the band and were really surprised how neat the controls were so we set out to make a project with the neat little armband. also wanted to use unity as it is a very interesting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a small game showcasing the powers of the Myo armband, showing the ability it has when combined with unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using unity and the SDK for the Myo, we built upon those frameworks to develop a way to read from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -very complicated (uses quatrains, unfamiliar with)
-had to go in with very little knowledge of c#
-lots of errors and bugs
-odd controls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -got it working
-the music
-nice clean code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot, from the framework of the Myo to c# itself. we went in with little knowledge of c# but learned a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MyoBall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It might become something more but, because we don't have the necessary hardware, it most likely won't be developed further
