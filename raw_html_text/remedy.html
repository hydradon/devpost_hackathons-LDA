                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the large amounts of people that could not afford medication, despite mass amounts of it being thrown away without being used. We thought that by combining these two problems, we could come up with a solution that kills two birds with one stone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is highly theoretical, as it is a model for a nonprofit organization. However, we were able to create a website that has functionality similar to what the actual website for the nonprofit might have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran it through React, and programmed it using HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, our team had a very hard time coming up with an idea that suited our interests and was also within our capabilities. The members of our team were also on the more inexperienced side, so we had a lot of trouble actually creating a website to present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have created a website. It was our first time creating one, and it was very exciting to see something we build come to life right in front of us. We're also proud of the idea that we came up with; we believe that it is a solution that could help a lot of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the hacking process, including brainstorming ideas and actually creating our solutions. It was an amazing experience to be able to do all of this in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remedy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably improve the website as we get better at coding; it'll be really cool to be able to see our improvement over time.
