                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of what would make our lives easier as students
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automates operations BEFORE (when you place your phone against TAG when entering):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        enables wifi
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        disables sounds
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sets low brightness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            the 3 above are configurable by students via a Control panel
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            signs you up as present and sends the time you arrived to class to the database
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            takes you to a link for your lecture notes for the day, IF they are available
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            the 2 above are NOT configurable and will happen everytime
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ... and AFTER lectures (when you place your phone against the TAG one more time, when exiting):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        sends the time you got out to the database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        disables wifi
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        enables sounds
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sets med-high brightness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        takes you to an online survey where you submit feedback, IF one is available
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        again, they are configurable or not in a similar fashion to the BEFORE actions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio (Java with some APIs for NFC) for the app and mysql for the database. Our database is remotely hosted on an AWS server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Lots and lots of bugs

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    A LOT about databases, queries, remote connections in JAVA and manipulating the phone's environment (wifi, sounds, brightness) in Android Studio and lots more..
                </p>
