                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taken from our love for Hackathons, we decided to create a software that shows the cheapest flights to the selected Hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software scrapes the devpost website for all the available hackathons, parses the resulting .json in order to create an array with all the hackathons and enables the user to browse through the available events via a Leap Motion device. Once a hackathon is selected, we use the Skyscanner API to look for the cheapest flights to said location and redirects the user to the flight webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python script to scrape the devpost website for all the available hackathons. We used C# in Visual Studio alongside several references such as the Newtonsoft Json Deserializer in order to process the scraped information and further manipulate it. We also used C# in Visual Studio to create the interface and Leap Motion controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to learn for the first time how to use an API, Python, how to implement an API and other resources, were all big challenges, but we managed to get past them using teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcoming all of the challenges we faced was the accomplishment that we're most proud of. We also feel like we did a good job working together as a team through stressful times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned advanced C#, Python and general API knowledge throughout the development of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackScanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worldwide implementation and future advanced features are all to come in the near future.
