                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team was inspired by the problem of plastics that enter our ocean and the inability of individuals in developed countries to make a meaningful direct contribution to solving this problem beyond one less straw used, or plastic bag at the supermarket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ocean Currency provides direct social impact for individuals and employees whose contributions, in the form of a percentage of sales from purchasing recycled products in our marketplace, will pay for the waste management solutions on island nations most impacted by climate change, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Now, participants can make this meaningful contribution through our web site and see their money put to direct use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Design Thinking process to collaboratively iterate and brainstorm a solution in the form of an e-Commerce platform. We used the business model canvas to detail the viability of the solution and modeled a web prototype for the solution on Salesforce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right business model and target customer for the solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on the problem rather than the solution/technology and used an iterative process to ensure that the solution captured the essence of the company as well as the needs of the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned through the process of reaching the required number of individuals to pay for the solution was a challenge and hence we pivoted to sell the solution to the CSR departments of companies as they can reach their employees more easily through our solution.
                </p>
