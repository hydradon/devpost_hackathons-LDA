                    We saw local artists struggle to find local audiences and wade through the noise of online traffic
What Pulse does is create a channel purely for concerts worldwide. Performers announce their shows through the platform and users hear about local shows from artists they follow or artists within their local area. Without the noise of Facebook or Instagram, it provides a platform purely for live music, and their respective artists, to be discovered by new fans.

                <p>
                    The idea is that announcing and finding local shows is easy and intuitive and takes very few steps to do.

                    Further concepts that we would like to explore include a check-in for consumers as they arrive at the respective venues, a feed to see what users' friends are going to, and a rating system to measure engagement.
