                    There is plenty of good to do in the world, but sometimes people aren't sure where to start. One thing that almost anyone can do is help pick up trash out of places in the environment it doesn't belong. Based on the popular #TrashTag challenge, TrashTagger enables users to find out where they can help, and have fun doing so.

                    TrashTagger is an application in which users can mark areas in the environment that have been polluted with litter. These locations are marked on a map with the name of the spotter, an intensity rating, and a before picture of the pollution. All users can see marked locations and contribute to the cleanup effort. Upon completion of the cleanup, users can take after pictures and select "Complete Cleanup", adding their names, pictures, and short blurbs to a gallery, and removing the pin from the map if the intensity rating is reduced below a threshold.
