                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oh hey we're on the third floor, not sure where to specify that so I'll put it here. :^)

                    We both realize that gambling is a huge problem, as we have both dabbled in gambling. It can begin with a basic coin flip, and lead to a massive net loss. So, we created a gambling simulator. Using theorems such as the Kelly Criterion, the Law of Infinite Wealth, the Visible Probability Trap, and the Law of Large Numbers, we prove that it is inevitable that a player will lose all their money.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made two different simulators, a coin flip and a slot machine (we were planning on making a crash game and a roulette game but we didn't have enough time). Through this simulation, users can experiment with gambling and realize the risks of gambling, without having to actually gamble real money.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript Prototype.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of our coding not working - due to us being incompetent and making dumb errors, like not properly linking CSS to HTML files, for example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our code to work, not strangling each other in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're both hasty with our code and we should probably slow down to not make simple errors that take us 30 minutes to figure out.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Kelly Criterion Simulator

                <p>
                    Hopefully market our simulator to an app; add additional simulators (a crash simulator, roulette simulator).
