                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These days, everyone is in a rush, and people often can't find the time to work out. Slim N' Trim is an easy way to generate exercises that you can fit into your schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on how many minutes you have, the app randomly selects a set of exercises from the genre you pick (such as cardio or abs).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and sample code online to figure out how to get it to work. We also used our background in java for the overall structure of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being familiar with Android Studio, making it harder to do even simple things. We also wanted to make it a more interesting and original app, but we did not want to overcomplicate it and end up with a nonfunctional app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to make a working app using software we hadn't used before with minimal help from other people. We also feel that we improved from where we were last year.

                    How to use Android Studio as well as improving our ability to not overcomplicate things.

                    What's next for SlimNTrim
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more features such as having an account and being able to save your past workouts. We would also like to add more workout options and make it more innovative and desirable.
