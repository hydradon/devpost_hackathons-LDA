                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few nights ago, a friend was really anxious because the stock market was dropping and he missed his chance to sell when he was ahead. We wanted to create a way to help people make informed decisions if they are unsure whether they should buy or sell.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads in stock data over the period of time relevant to the investor, and analyzes it by first smoothing it out to eliminate "false peaks", then making a mathematically informed decision based on trends in the slope of the graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was extracted using R. The analysis algorithm was implemented with Python, and embedded using Flask into a website made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
                </p>
