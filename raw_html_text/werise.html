                    Most of us in my team felt intimidated by tech and computer science when we were in high school and even in our first year of college, none of us thought we would get into programming. A lot of people feel the same way and are scared of stem fields. We want to spread the word that it's okay to be scared but it's not okay to not try. We provide them with a platform where they can explore and get a jumpstart on a possible programming career or hobby.

                <p>
                    It categorizes different resources like free programming courses in a pragmatic fashion where people can choose the level that they feel most comfortable with in terms of programming skills and pursue courses of their choice.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it during Hackattack within 24 hours using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap in the front-end and Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB in the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges like parsing links with a different record and pulling data from databases to render it to front-end. Not all of us were familiar with the stack used, so we also had some learning curve to cross and we did it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we built a full-fledged web application that provides essential learning resources for all the steminists out there who do not know they are one yet.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about team-building, planning, MongoDB and Node.js. We also learned proper communication skills and pitching skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for WeRise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to send weekly newsletters to alert curious minds about events happening around their area. We also want to make this project open-source so that people can contribute more to it and make it a safe space and use it to inspire everyone to explore stem fields.
