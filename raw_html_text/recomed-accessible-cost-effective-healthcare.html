                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life is busy and so are we. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t have the time nor knowledge to take care of ourselves. Whether we are under the weather or passing around the never dying cold &amp; flu. We have RecoMed here to help you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There have been numerous occasions to which we can all attest from personal experience when we had to wait days if not weeks to see a doctor. Although a visit to the local pharmacy perhaps offers much better chances sometimes we dont know what to take. Even if we check with the pharmacist, the awareness of the dosage, drug interactions and follow up is confusing and lacking, leading to most drugs not used for its completed course of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecoMed is your medical pharmacy assistant which also has the potential to be available in remote areas and after hours. RecoMed measures your BMI, vitals and records your health data and communicates back to you and provides recommendations of medicine based on the questionnaire and the data.  Existing automatic pharmacy assistants dispense medication, but offer no information directly about the patients&rsquo; health and does not indicate of contraindications that if unnoticed can also lead to death. 
We propose RecoMed, which will evaluate vitals using multiple sensors and offer recommendations to patients for over the counter medication. Observe the length of the condition and recommend OTC drugs or recommended to see a PCP. RecoMed is intended to make pharmacy efficient and aid the staff to provide their experience where most needed. RecoMed seeks to advance the state-of-the-art and improve efficacy of the pharmaceutical field while providing accessible healthcare to patients in remote areas in the need. The patient-pharmacist or patient-doctor relationship is vital to optimal healthcare and RecoMed enhances that bond to provide the patient the time and resources form them as they sometimes have to manage their time to help patients with over the counter needs more than helping the people with prescription medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RecoMed seeks to create a health informed citizenry through awareness of self-vitals, and providing easy to understand breakdown of medicines opposed to the lengthy prescriptions that accompany drugs these days. The hope is RecoMed will result in an increase in public awareness about medicines, which promises to crystallize into better well being of the population at large.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to create a database of logins and to create the UI, which is interfaced to Arduinos that control the sensors to examine the pulse, weight, height (Sonar Sensor) and temperature, (future would be to use blood pressure monitors and optical sensors for o2 saturation levels). The user also fills up a questionnaire and recommendations are made using the answers and the vitals data. Another pair of Aruduino controls the machine and dispenses the drug that was checked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The results for the pulse sensor and the temperature sensor were inconsistent and could not be trusted due to hysteresis.   Also due to the finite time available for the hack we decided to focus more on the workability of the dispensing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully connect the UI to the arduino and create a working prototype with the questionnaire and recommendations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned we can definitely accomplish a lot more when we all come together. Coming in we didn't have the expectations of completing the project with a working prototype and we are very proud of it. Looking at the successful prototype, it's amazing how people from various backgrounds can come together and make a product in  less that 48 hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for RecoMed : Accessible &amp; Cost Effective Healthcare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future of RecoMed promises to get a thousands of data points from analyzing the data of the prescriptions sold based on demographics and help insurance and pharmaceutical companies to make decisions, create products and provide services by analyzing them. Also pushing the dosage information on to the patient's calendar for them to remember taking the meds and to complete their doses, leading to a healthier individual and a healthier society.
