                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was made by Mohammed Wahdani. He thought that paying for college can be a pain and thought of a way to have students help each other in this regard. If a student needs help with something, they can pay another student to help, hence the name Double Help.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates account and saves them. It also logs the accounts in if they match a saved account. After that, the user can etiher search for available jobs, which are also saved, create a job, or just sign out.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JavaFX to create this project since JavaFX is GUI-based. As for the rest of the non-GUI functions, I just used conventional java coding to make the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to get somewhat of a refresher on JavaFX while coding, and as a result, I ran into several errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud to have made a project of this magnitude and having to code alone in about 8-9 hours of actual coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I need to find more people who can code alongside me to made programming much easier.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    If anyone becomes interested in the idea, I plan on expanding to code to make it an official website.
