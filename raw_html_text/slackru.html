                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a slack bot that would make the experience for hackers and mentors a bit more organized and clean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now its functionality is solely based on finding available mentors for hackers to talk to when they have concerns about some hacking tool or hacking language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to talk to the slack client and we used a sqlite database to integrate multiple mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with the slack api, jfc

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that the bot was able to create new private channels between mentors and their hackers, really cool stuff
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the slack api with python, it's a lot easier to use once you've had a long lasting relationship with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SlackRU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This slack bot was not made just to have this mentor functionality, we intend to add a lot more relevant things for this slack bot to do, like create shoutouts to tell hackers about upcoming events, help hackers talk to other group members of the hackathon group, etc.
