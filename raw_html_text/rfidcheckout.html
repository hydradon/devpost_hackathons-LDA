                    What's next for RFIDCheckout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The applications for this technology don't stop with supermarkets. It can be applied to a large variety of industries, in everything from schools and colleges with ID cards to charging import taxes at borders. By using RFID we also open up immense possibilities for use of big data to manage and maintain supermarket databases and analyse customer purchases.
