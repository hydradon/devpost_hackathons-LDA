                    We change the Airbnb's pricing model from fixed to fluctuating price base on the guest's actual experience.
We enable smart contract to execute fluctuating price.

                <p>
                    At first I use Ether.camp to create a contract.
Since it is already installed Ethereum, I feel easy to use it.
I hope I can share my ether.camp project to the team member.

                    I was in trouble how to run truffle.
When I try to run
                    <code>
                        truffle deploy
                    </code>
                    following the tutorial, http error occurred.
Finally, I found that I need to run
                    <code>
                        testrpc
                    </code>
                    before
                    <code>
                        truffle deploy
                    </code>
                    when I read

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a smart contract with Truffle and Solidity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing with truffle is much easier than with Meteor + geth.
I was impressed to
                    <code>
                        testrpc
                    </code>
                    . Before
                    <code>
                        testrpc
                    </code>
                    , I needed to run
                    <code>
                        geth
                    </code>
                    and mine the contract.

                <p>
                    I wanted to install other npm module to my truffle app. 
I followed the
                    <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/wiki/Using-Truffle-and-Webpack-(beta)" rel="nofollow">
                        instruction
                    </a>
                    but the error "no web3 found" has occurred.
I would love to fix the error and install npm libs to use React.
