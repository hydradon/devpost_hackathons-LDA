Are power tool to connect us humans
As all tools, have been used for the wrong intentions.

                <p>
                    We propose a web extension for chrome that runs in the backend a machine learning model that identifies comments on different social networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the next time you are checking your newsfeed, you can have a head&rsquo;s up of what&rsquo;s coming, studies show that Pain is perceived as less intense when a person is distracted from it,

                <p>
                    This can also be a tool for community managers to quickly identify toxic comments.

                    We took the scripts from Toxicity Classifier and added them to a very simple chrome extension.

                    Every hackathon there's always new to learn :) the slope was slow for us on Javascript as we are not very fluent on it (yet)
Plus one of our teammates let us down :( (the one that knew Javascript by the way)

                    Creating Chrome extension is really cool, fun and they can be very useful.

                    What's next for Social Sentiment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can try to make it work on other Social Networks but it might be really useful if this is deployed on the backend of each social network, so it's a matter of each provider of implementing something similar depending the case.
