                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started with the idea of ​​selling online game authentication tokens and was inspired by a smart contract called Bomb that tries to adjust the distribution speed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Those who have the contract of Tier 0 as a base can get tokens of the linked application by burning it. The currency managed by the Tier0 contract loses a certain percentage when you send money, but the lost currency goes back to the Remaining pool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dapp was built with React.js. The smart contract uses Ganache and Truffle in consideration of deployment to the Ethereum environment. The tokens of Tier 1 and later layers are used by 0x products so that they can be freely traded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it was the first time to use 0x, it was introduced because it was very promising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it's great to be able to create Dapp that works from Tier 0 to Tier 2 so that you can imagine what actually moves. In addition, the UI has also been devised, such as creating a video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the environment construction in Dapp creation to the test method, bugs and mistakes that are easy to fall in are well understood and learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Cre8
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to create more tiers and create an online game authentication token that was originally envisioned.
