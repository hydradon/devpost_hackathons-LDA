                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Story overflow was inspired my the idea of multiple writers or writer enthusiasts to contribute to creating a short story. We believe that new and interesting story ideas would come out of the worlds collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Story overflow starts out with a prompt, which writer can use as the starting base for their story. Following that prompt, writers will each post and vote on the best post to continue the story. As writers gain more popularity the would be allowed to type more characters into their posts. Multiple stories can be created, viewed, and contributed to at any time.

                <p>
                    Not knowing enough about SQL/databases limited our options to local storage. Not enough time to create the user interface.
