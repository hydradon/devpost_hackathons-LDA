                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eighty-four percent of people underestimated what they spent on digital subscriptions in a new survey. Do you know how much you're spending? Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, HBO, Apply Music, Amazon Prime, VPNs, Cable, Internet, Phone bills... how much are we spending!?!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sought to visualize and impact how much people were spending monthly on subscriptions services, so that they can see how to reduce their monthly cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our product also features automated monthly notifications to keep track of monthly spending.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flutter for the front end app. Using Flutter is important to us because we can reach the widest audience on IOS and Android.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase and Google Cloud Functions to automate our app and interact with banking APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Captial One's Nessie API to analyze purchases occurring monthly and for billing statements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the technology (Flutter, GCP) was completely new for us and debugging things like functions not calling the correct API and credentials errors took a lot of time and were major challenges.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Flutter is highly functional but also takes time to configure correctly

                    <li>
                        Firebase is easy to setup, but often hard to access besides using provided libraries
