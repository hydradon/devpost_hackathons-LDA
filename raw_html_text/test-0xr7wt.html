                    When the skill is enabled, users would be given a mission daily by asking &lsquo;Ask Eco Challenge what is the mission for today&rsquo;. The missions will be a task the users need to finish on the day, for example, picking up rubbishes, using public transportation etc. The users can get points when they completed a challenge at the end of the day by saying &lsquo;Tell Eco Challenge the mission is completed&rsquo;. When getting to every 10 points, they can earn a badge which send through to their email. They can share it to social media and encourage their friends to take the challenges.
