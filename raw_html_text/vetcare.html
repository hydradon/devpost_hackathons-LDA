                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the appalling fact that around 22 veterans are dying due to suicide per day, so I wanted to create an application to help prevent this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It  shows nearby centers for veterans such as health services and monetary funds as well as having a suicide hotline specifically for veterans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used App Inventor 2 for the front end and to seemlessly move from one screen to another, and I also used the Google Maps API to display maps that showed nearby centers for veterans by using fusion tables to store their addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first time coding an app, I had a hard time making it. At first, I tried to use Firebase to store the addresses, but I wasn't able to get it working in App Inventor, so then after many hours of scraping the web, I found I could use fusion tables from the Google Maps API. I coulcn't create a link from the address to Google Maps if the address was clicked on, but I found out that through Streetview that I could take a link to Google Maps.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of learning how to use fusion tables to pin different locations as well as creating a functional application in what was my first attempt at making an app, and I did it by myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learned how to use fusion tables and App Inventor.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to be able to implement a GPS that allows the user to see their location on the maps. I also wanted to create a photo album for the user to keep pictures of his/her loved ones.
