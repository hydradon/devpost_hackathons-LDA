                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hit a pothole on the drive into Clemson and are really tired of them not being corrected. We thought there has to be a better to let Clemson University know about pot holes and various maintenance requests in. Even better, what if we had a crowd sourcing option to let Clemson know what we thought was more important.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CUFixIt allows users to take a photo of the grievance, automatically collect the coordinates of the event, and shows the recent postings for maintenance to fix.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CUFixIt was built with Node.JS, phpMyAdmin, HTML, and CSS.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data base management was the biggest issue on this project. Also, this was our team's first time using Node.JS for a serious project.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a somewhat working mobile app.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided we do not want to go into Web Development after graduation. We also learned how big of a pain data base management can be, how sometimes it may easier to build from the ground up instead of working from a template, and to always have fun while hacking away at new ideas.

                    Getting a solid working, white-box tested prototype for a live demo!
