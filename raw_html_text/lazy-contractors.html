                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hearing other people's ideas about games, and the simple one click to to fix inspired me to do this.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There has been an uprise in customers in the building, and the player need to make sure that the customers don&rsquo;t leave. But a problem has appeared, there are cracks appearing all across the building. The player will use a variety tools to fix each crack. Each tool has its unique abilities, from the ability to remove a single crack to the ability of removing all the cracks on the building.However, if a crack is left unfixed things are going to go downhill. Bricks will start falling from the building, and hitting the player&rsquo;s precious customers. And If a customer get hit 5 times, the player will lose a valued customer. But if the player removes 5 cracks the player will get rewarded with money base on the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Sprite Kit to enable physics, to give me a response when a contact began. Also a special algorithm to generate random cracks all across the building.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into were that, I trouble with physics in SprikeKit. Each time an error occurred, I had to make special code for that problem.
