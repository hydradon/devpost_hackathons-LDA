                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traveling in a new country is a great experience, but you want to grab a drink and maybe meet a local. Sitting alone in your dorm room and want to grab a drink with someone new, use our app to find interesting and fun new people. We have created the app to match you with other who want to grab a drink and meet some amazing people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    matches people who want to grab a beer with others near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have based our system on Firebase/Geofire and android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No-one in the team had used any of the technologies we used in the project, so it was a steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we have been able to create a working application from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to learn a new technology, just jump into it with a project and you can pick it up relatively quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GrabAPint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to work on it together and hope to have a first release on the app store by easter-time so we can start improving iteratively based on what people want.
