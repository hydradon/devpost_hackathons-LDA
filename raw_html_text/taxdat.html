                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make finding how much one would actually pay for a product much easier, which is especially important when travelling and you're unsure how much the tax is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses saved data files to calculate the sales tax based off an inputted location with two parameters: state and county/city in the United States.
                </p>
                <h2>
