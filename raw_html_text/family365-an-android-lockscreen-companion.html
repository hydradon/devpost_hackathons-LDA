                <p>
                    In this contemporary world, safety for a person especially for a woman is still a myth and there are no straightforward or intuitive means to summon for help. This made to think of a simple SOS button which would call out for help. That's how Family365 was started.

                <p>
                    Family365 is an Android Lock Screen and your safety companion which keeps you safe while keeping you updated with your family. Family365 uses Neura SDK to machine learn the user's activities and provide context related lock screen settings, while it uses Affectiva SDK to sense users feelings and react according it. Family365 consists of various features as mentioned,

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a Lock Screen for Android wasn't an easy task, I had to test with the multiple test cases and it was time-consuming.  Meanwhile, the context detection, face detection, and emotion-detecting were also the hardest part if Neura SDK and Affective Emotional SDK was not there.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now I can add an expert in Machine Learning and Face Emotion Detection in my CV. ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first application on Face Emotion Detection and Context Engine(Machine Learning) which are the few of the toughest technologies. I learned that these could be achieved now without much effort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Family365, an Android LockScreen Companion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could implement all the features I had in mind due to lack of time as I started 3 days back. Once I add all the features, I am going to launch Family365 very soon on Playstore. Hope it would really help the people to stay safe and always stay connected with their family.
