                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To provide users with a application that allows them to submit reports about any suspicious activities they see without the fear of filing a police report. (False police reports are subject to fines hence the fear.)

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Allows users to submit suspicion reports that police can view and see the location of the report. The report will contain information for the officer to view as well as contact information of the submitter. Police can then investigate
on their free time and check it off if there is nothing to worry about.
