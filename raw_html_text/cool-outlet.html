                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with JavaScript, and we wanted to make a game, and we wanted a map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as the Onion Prince, a simple onion who is just trying to get to work. Can you help him overcome all of the obstacles and get to work on time?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Phaser.js to build a game running on a Node server. It's currently deployed on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have much front end or JavaScript experience, so the learning curve was a bit steep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a (mostly) working game, which is pretty cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of Node servers, the Phaser library, and the basics of JavaScript development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cool Outlet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We currently have the first three levels, but a lot more stops on the T for future ones. We also want to work on the logic for our level generation, lock levels that are farther away, and add in a leaderboard.
