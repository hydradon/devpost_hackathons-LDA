                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. 1 in 8 women in Canada will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. Yet, the 5 year survival rate is 100% if diagnosed in stage 1. So if women had an easy and cost-effective way to perform self exams and detect breast cancer early enough the survival rates of breast cancer could increase.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to take a picture of your breast, and track the change of their physical appearance. It also allows women to track other symptoms, and have access to how frequent these symptoms have been occurring in order to share valuable information with their doctors. The application would also give women access to information regarding care, statistics, resources and more.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with custom vision which allowed us to detect a problem or a change from a predefined set of pictures. We then developed an application using Java, that allows us to take a picture and compare this picture from our set of base pictures of no problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were feeding the application with information from custom vison. We needed this bridge in order to detect changes in the shape of our play doh balls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a working application that takes a picture of a play doh ball and detects changes to its shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about custom vision and the different properties it offers. We also learned how to work in a team and delegate actions.

                    What's next for Arbitrium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be implementing the user interface in the application, and the other functionalities such as inputting symptoms and tracking these symptoms overtime.
