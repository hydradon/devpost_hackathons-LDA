                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use one of the most important purposes of a block chain system: decentralization. After a short brainstorming session we came up with the idea of CARSTEN.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a peer-to-peer car sharing app, that uses the block chain technology Ethereum to ensure a secure service for both of the contract partners without a trusted middle man.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the Ethereum Smart-Contract using the remix IDE from ethereum.org, compiled it on a linux machine and deployed it in the test block-chain rinkeby (infura.io). To access the smart contract and provide a user interface we built a iOS app with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was to familiarize ourselves with the smart contract environment. After some time we figured out how to write the contract and deploy it. The second biggest problem was of conceptual nature: how to make the process secure for both of the contracting partners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of understanding more of the concept of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Smart Contracts. It is a huge success for us to write our own smart contract that is in the public test block chain.
