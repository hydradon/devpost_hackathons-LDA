                    Math Wars isn't just your typical math skill, with Bonus Rounds, and a few Surprises, learning has never been so fun!
Whether you're challenging yourself or battling others, Math Wars is a great way to learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used NodeJS / Lambda as the logic controller for the game, and I used DDB to store the users previous settings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first started with the idea of scoring being based on the time it took the user to answer the question.
Although I knew when my lambda was called, I couldn't be sure of network latency or how long it actually took Alexa to ask a question so I decided to go a different route, that's when I added in bonuses.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think Math Wars has a lot of features, and is very intuitive. This is the largest Alexa app I've made, and I'm very proud!
