                    Imagine you&rsquo;re driving in your car. This particular day you seem to be in a rush looking for a place to eat, a store to buy last minute presents, or even simply in a hurry to get home. Along with the stress from these events you seem to be receiving a plethora of emails, messages, and calls. This scenario can be applied to almost every person. You know that if you pick up your phone you could jeopardize your life and the lives of your passengers. Many companies have attempted to eradicate distracted driving, however, none of these systems are practical or responsive. For example apple has attempted to accomplish this very goal through Siri, their virtual assistant. This endeavor along with many others such as hands free calling have failed because of their lack of access to detailed information, simple responsive functions, and wifi reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, our team has devised a revolutionary form of efficient, safe, and wireless communication in a personal travel assistant through Amazon&rsquo;s cloud based web service, Amazon Alexa. We&rsquo;d like to introduce to you Toyota Tessa. T.E.S.S.A. is a unique and powerful car interface as its goal is to eradicate distracted driving as well as facilitate many user-console interactions in a more efficient manner; using voice. Now you can ask for directions, locate stores, restaurants, and businesses as well as communicate through email, texts, and phone calls without ever looking away from the road. This will eliminate the drivers need to lift their phone and change their field of vision which will make every trip you make with your family a safe one. In order to ensure you can rely on such a device, our team has also devised a solution to make the unit truly wireless; eliminated its reliance on wifi. Through the development of a local server, and caching of thousands of gigabytes of information, we have managed to remove Alexa's wifi dependability making this a truly independent and autonomous unit. Due to echo's compact form factor, Alexa can be discreetly mounted in your car allowing it to remain on standby every second of everyday. Now Alexa's key features are available to you anywhere on the go.

                <p>
                    In addition to the 24/7 access to Alexa's natural language processing skills, you are given the ability to communicate wirelessly. Toyota TESSA allows you make wireless calls and texts. We are also excited to present a new key feature in TESSA communication. Artificial intelligence and speech NLP have now been implemented into your email. Now you can simply ask TESSA to clean your inbox, read messages for you, and, through implementation of speech NLP, TESSA can summarize your emails along with possible actions you can take upon these emails such as trash, summarize, and skip.

                <p>
                    Lastly, we'd like to show you one final key environmental feature. We call this feature commute. Due to its machine learning capabilities, Alexa can analyze your car's carbon emissions, ETA, and distance to devise a "smart route" that consumes the least amount of gasoline and delivers you to your destination faster. Alexa also monitors traffic updates to reroute your commute based on accidents, traffic, etc. while still factoring your smart route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Passenger and environmental safety have been a key feature in creating this application. We were guided by the idea that we may save lives and secure the environments safety through the development of this app. We think that this app is qualifies for multiple Toyota challenges including the Toyota Connected NLP, Toyota Connected - Driver Interface, best social impact, and best environmental impact. We qualify for the Toyota Connected NLP challenge because our app utilizes advanced speech NLP and can respond to NLP queries. We have worked tirelessly to produce a speech NLP system with low latency as to provide the best user experience. We qualify for the Toyota - Driver Interface because the app also possesses an advanced driver interface that allows the user to communicate with their voice. We qualify for the best social impact because we have attempted to solve an issue that remains ubiquitous and has plagued many people of all ages across the world. We believe our solution is revolutionary and will help people as we plan to release it to the market soon. We qualify for the best environmental impact because our app continues to preserve the environment and solve one of humanities greatest threats in the most efficient way possible. The implementation of multiple technologies shows us that we can produce a powerful and efficient solution to even the mot elusive of issues such as environment and climate change which remains an issue that continues to plague to entire world.
