                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was a volunteer for my city's water quality management program in high school. Testing local water bodies was difficult and expensive, so I wanted to develop a powerful and cost-effective alternative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The graphical user interface takes in downloaded Landsat 8 imagery and allows the user to extract important information with a multi-step sequential interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and powerful libraries like numpy and opencv to process imagery and perform the necessary computations and transformations on the raw satellite images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heavy logical errors because we were integrating so many different libraries in a relatively short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a viable research tool for scientists to scan the Earth's surface from data going all the way back from the 1970's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tkinter python library and numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LandPy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More advanced analysis features such as advanced regressions to plot the future trend of water/land features in the future.
