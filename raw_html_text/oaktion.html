                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tackled the problem of responsable behaviour in a smart city. We believe that the "smartness" of a city relies on the "smartness" of the citizens. We wanted to bring an incentive-based service, a "nudge" in a broad sense, in order to foster green gestures/behaviours, rewarding the most commited users.
The rewarding system is based on a platform that gives real world vouchers to use in local businesses, based on the behaviour of the citizens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple mobile application , where you can report problems you see when you're walking/hanging around in the city. The typical problems are dirty streets due to incorrect garbage disposal, broken lights, broken access doors to several public places.
The user takes a picture of the problem : the geolocalisation used on the phone provides information to municipalities in order to optimize their cleaning services.
Local businesses are able to generate vouchers using a real time bidding system.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The integration of the APIs provided by the organization were a real challenge to adapt to our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone's proud of the final result, considering the reduced amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team accomplished a big load of work in order to provide a prototype. Coordination is also one of the most important things, considering there are three developers in the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oaktion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea needs to be challenged by users and local businesses, as well as municipalities/local public authorities. We need to confirm there's a market in order to rapidly know if we could develop the application in a more "professionnal" manner.
