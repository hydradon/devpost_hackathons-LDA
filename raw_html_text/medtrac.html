                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        As an aspiring doctor in this modern technological age, I wanted to find a way to implement solutions to advance and innovate outdated practices. I thought about the struggles with medical data records and the common miscommunication between healthcare professionals. This led me to solve this issue by building a system where patient data is transferred directly to a tablet via Bluetooth.

                        What it does
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We designed a healthcare solution to increase efficiency within hospitals. Our solution places Bluetooth low energy beacons in every room and Bluetooth low energy beacon wristband transmitting live time data from patients.

                    <h2>
                        Challenges we ran into
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Since Hack Western provides a plethora of resources at our disposal, we were able to overcome the technical difficulties experienced. However, we struggled the most with extraneous challenges such as time constraints as a result of conflicting academic demands. This prevented us from being fully committed towards our project and limited the amount of work that could be completed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        As a result of conflicting academic schedules, our team faced a tighter time constraint. We are definitely proud that we were able to take relatively older technology and make it relevant in the healthcare industry.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        What we learned
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We learned how to develop a pitch deck to showcase our product. Instead of purchasing beacons, we were worked on building a working Android application to receive and emit Bluetooth signals. However, we were unable to complete the task, but we learned Bluetooth technology and a higher understanding of Java in mobile development.

                        What's next for medTrac
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We plan on completing the first stage of our product and pitching our solution to our target market. Initially, we wanted to implement smart assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, into our solution. However, after discussions, our group decided that new technologies need to be eased into the healthcare industry, minimizing risks. We plan on moving further with IoT and designing innovative solutions for the healthcare industry. We hope to see medTrac in the healthcare industry worldwide.
