                <p>
                    It is always a struggle to choose which restaurant to eat with your friends. We created this app to let a group of friends vote for which nearby restaurant to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One person will generate a random generated QR code, and the other users will each scan the QR code to join the voting group. Each person will then vote on what they want to eat from a list of nearby restaurants generated using the Google-Places API. The voting result will then show once everyone finish voting.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio with Firebase as the backend database.

                        We can integrate with Instagram by showing pictures of the food for each restaurant.

                    <li>
                        We need to integrate with using the Android device's GPS.
