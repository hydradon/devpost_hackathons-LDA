                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anthony Fantano is well known for his reviews and his unique taste in music. We wanted to try and replicate his taste through machine learning while also learning a new skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a sample of past album reviews that Fantano has published and trains a model to predict scores using an album's "audio-features" as provided by the spotify API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a lot of CSV files to store extrapolated data from the spotify API and then used a RandomForestRegressor model to somewhat accurately predict Fantano's album rating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know what we should extrapolate
We are new to machine learning so learning the processes needed was a challenge indeed
The ratings our model creates is not as dynamic as we would have liked (gravitating towards a 5 at all times)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Took our first steps in machine learning
Learned a lot about navigating the spotify API somewhat effectively
CREATED AN ML MODEL

                <p>
                    Implement more relevant data points to correlate towards the final score (effectively make the score more dynamic)
