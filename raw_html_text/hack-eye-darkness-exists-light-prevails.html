                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humans are conscious beings. But what if that power is snatched away from someone with respect to a very important aspect : The power of sight!! We have tried to return that power back to those who need it. This is a real life hack into the inhibition caused due to blindness of the eyes. The estimated number of people visually impaired in the world is 285 million, 39 million blind and 246 million having low vision. 82% of blind people are above 50 years of age and thus have hearing deficiencies as well, thus partially losing out on another sense organ. 0.7 million people in the world are both deaf and blind. Thus, this provided us with a huge motivation in order to come to their assistance in an eco-friendly and cost effective way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is worn on the hand by a person in the form of a palm-wrap. An obstacle, be it animate or inanimate, is detected by this device in the form of a sound emanated from a buzzer and vibration from a motor, embedded in the system. The maximum distance at which the obstacle can be detected is 350 cm. A voice from any surrounding source will cause just a vibration in the motor. These two options are available for the blind, the deaf and both together. Extreme bright lights and extreme dark zones are detected in the form of sound emanated from buzzer only. This is an option for just blind people. Thus, a pervasive alertness system is provided in an easy-to-wear model.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm was designed using Arduino IDE. The ultrasonic sensor, light detecting resistor and sound detector were responsible for the three most important aspects of constant vigilance : proximity, light sensitivity and sound, respectively. A battery powered Arduino Uno board helped to implement the algorithm devised.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The following problems we ran into:
1) The algorithm we devised to accommodate the criteria for both the blind and the deaf was very complicated.
2) Due to the absence of a sound detector module, a microphone amplifier module was used and hence the algorithm was designed separately.
3) Eliminating the ambient noise and sound was another important criterion which posed a major challenge.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is cost effective because not every blind person is wealthy enough to purchase the products available in the market. Our product considers the real time problem that majority of the world's blind people are aged 50 or above. Hence, our device will take care of the problem when blind people have hearing impediments due to age. We devised different parts of the logic separately, and then integrated them into the same module. Thus teamwork is what we displayed in a coordinated manner. Finally, we developed and validated a product that delivers as promised.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These are some of the things we learnt:
1) Programming in Arduino IDE platform and logic building
2) Application of different sensors
3) Module Integration
4) Teamwork

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can include more useful criteria into our existing module, given more time. We can design better algorithms for further development.
