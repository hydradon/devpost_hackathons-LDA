                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Airliners spend a lot of money on jet fuel that isn't needed. These cost reductions will allow ticket prices to become cheaper and makes traveling more affordable. As a world traveler myself, the benefits of this program will support me and thousands of others alike.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes the data of the flight path from a remote server through a JSON request. Then the program calculates the difference in distance between the GPS coordinates and figures out the appropriate fuel cost for that specific flight.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a complicated formula and getting the data was difficult.

                <p>
                    The program functions as I envisioned it to be.
