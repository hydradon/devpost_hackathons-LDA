                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we have all had difficulty controlling our spending in our daily lives and wanted to investigate if we could come up with a hack that helps us manage our money a little more responsibly.  Our starting point was learning about the data the Capital One Nessie API could offer and thinking what could we do with it to find ways people could save based on their history and make future suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app tracks purchases made using the Capital One Nessie API. For each purchase it asks the user how happy they are with the purchase at the time, and several times after. This data can then be used to check how your happiness with a purchase decays over time (overpriced StarBucks coffee might make you happy for a few hours, but a plane ticket will make you happy for weeks). It nags you to make purchases that will end up making you more happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend was developed using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. The backend was developed using Javascript, jquery and the Capital One API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge was using the Capital One API - the API does not come with purchases already on the accounts, so we had to make up a lot of dummy data.
Another challenge was time management - we didn't manage to complete all the features that we wanted to include at the start, and linking the backend and frontend wasn't completed on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nagger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be really cool to continue working on Nagger! We could make it run on mobile devices, and it would be nice to integrate it with Apple/Android pay (popping up a question as soon as a purchase is made)
