                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all used Blackboards products for classes. It's a really great idea as an organizational tool, but it is far too cumbersome and students get frustrated. Let's face it: it really sucks. So we wanted to make something useful that didn't suck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Course Tracker allows you to add the classes you're taking to your profile and provides a todo-list style of task management for upcoming assignments, similar to apps like Wunderlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from a humble technical background, we used the bare bones basics to build our site. A LAMPs localhost web server, HTML, CSS, and PHP. (Yes that's right, PHP.) If that wasn't old school enough, we are storing all of our data in .csv files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using these languages (especially PHP) was labor intensive. More of us were familiar with basic javascript, but because you can't use javascript serverside, we turned to a PHP background for our backend. In another life, we would have liked to buckle down and just learn node.js already.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of all, we were proud to come together as a team of strangers with a humble technical background and spend the last 3 days developing a compelling idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functionality wise, we successfully generate course and assignment listings based off of course enrollment and can course through the course management page. And it looks pretty darn good too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Especially for our first timers, we acquired an introductory background in web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also developed a deep appreciation for all of the new tools out there that help to streamline the development process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First thing's first! A solid nap. Immediately afterward it's back to work, as usual!
