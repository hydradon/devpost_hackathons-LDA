                    Globalization refers to the shift toward a more integrated and interdependent world economy with one huge global marketplace. As the world becomes a truly integrated global economy, more firms, both large and small, are shifting toward international trade.

                    The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex Market) is the biggest and most liquid financial market in the world. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2013 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity showed that trading in foreign exchange markets averaged $5.3 trillion dollars per day in April 2013.

                <p>
                    Companies engaged in international trade and investment use the Forex Market to convert the the payments they receive for their exports, the income it receives from foreign investments and the income from licensing agreements with foreign firms in foreign currencies.

                <p>
                    The Forex Market is divided into levels of access. The levels of access are determined by the size of the "line" (the amount of money with which participants are trading). Thus, historically only large financial institutions, corporations, central banks, hedge funds and extremely wealthy individuals had the resources to participate and take full advantage of  the market.

                    For businesses involved in international trade, trading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. As companies engage in cross-border trade and investment, they need to recognize and understand currency fluctuation because what happens in the foreign exchange market can have a fundamental impact on their sales, profits and strategies.
