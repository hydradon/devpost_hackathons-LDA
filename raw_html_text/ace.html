                    A seperate part of the project which we did not complete was designed to be the original focus point of our presentation. Although I did not bring the hardware for it, we designed software on the Raspberri Pi to help people who are visually impaired to cross at intersections.

                    We acheived this by creating a bluetooth beacon to transmit traffic signal status (stop, proceed, stopping) to a recieving device, for example a phone which would vibrate to let the user know that they are able to proceed at the intersection. (This is a similified explaination!)

                    At a 4-way intersection, I designed a system where there would be four Bluetooth beacons (relatively cheap to operate) that would broadcast data about the traffic signal. We had to overcome some major restrictions with Bluetooth to pull this off: since Bluetooth inherintly requires pairing, we had to design a system such that traffic signals could communicate with other devices without needing bi-directional communication. I ultimately settled upon an interesting workaround to this which is broadcasting all the data we need to transmit to recievers through the Bluetooth device ID.

                    For example, a device ID could contain an encoded Latitude+Lontitude+CompasDirection in its name, as well as the status of the light: think about "SIG40.9999,-79.9999,299S1". Every time the traffic signal would change, the data following the final 'S' would change, but everything else remains the same.
