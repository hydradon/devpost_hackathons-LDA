                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from one of the speakers who challenged us to make an app that recognizes if objects are recyclable or not
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app lets you take a picture of an object and it will return what it thinks it is with a confidence score and let you know if it is recyclable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project on Xcode using swift and used CreateML to make the model
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were that we had little experience building iOS apps and we also had little experience with ML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we built a functioning app that actually uses ML in the background
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a UI that users would like and we also learned how an ML model is made
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SnapCycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionality such as a tracker that shows how much you are helping the earth with what you are recycling
