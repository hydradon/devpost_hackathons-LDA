                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>fun lights for boring bedroom, a companion app for when you're out and about riding, and a fuel gauge that doesn't touch your gas tank :D

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the led's light up in sync with the music, the app displays educational information, as well as provide a health aspect as it shows nearby medical facilities in case of need, and the fuel gauge does what a fuel gauge is supposed to do: tell you how much fuel you've got left.
