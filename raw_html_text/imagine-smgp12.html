                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are a student who just cannot imagine how the words in the book form a picture. What do the little twinkling starts up above the world so high look like? Trying to address questions like these, we came across developing Imagine, a never-seen-before text-to-image visualization web application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine takes the description from the user in the form of paragraph. By a combination of API implementation and ethical web scraping, the application performs meticulous calculations to present to you, in the internet's opinion, the most relevant image to the paragraph
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Retina API used by cortical as well as web scraping, we extracted key words out of each paragraph, used them in several combinations to find relevant images online, and picked the top three images after careful consideration. Of the algorithm!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the API and web scraping were the most challenging aspects of the program. The thought of 'translating a java program' was very wrong! It learning new softwares while having to do all this added a lot more to the challenges
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several new platforms and turned a far-reaching idea somewhat into a reality, as a platform for others to build upon in the noble field for positive changes in education, criminal description and drawing, and other such relevant fields
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides NodeJS, JavaScript, and Web Development, we learned team-work, time management, and goal-setting along with brainstorming strategies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Imagine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use it in several noble fields as mentioned before. Imagination is the limit!
