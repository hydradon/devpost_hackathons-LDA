                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Countless high school presentations where changing slides affected the quality of lecture. Teachers will benefit from the freedom of mobility obtained through contact-free slide advancements.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SoundTrak advances slides using audio input via external hardware.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino and multiple microphones to respond to clicks. The two microphones means that the device is directional, and that the audience can not trigger the controls.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the GUI with the Arduino due to an error in the communication protocol - this absorbed several hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working project, and we got sleep last night!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that communication between the different members of our team is crucial - even when something seems obvious.

                <h2>
                    What's next for SoundTrak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can improve audio reception with more time via an FFT implementation, which can increase the variety of signals. We can additionally implement this over more platforms such as videos and web-browsers.
