                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to develop a product which could facilitate a more seamless and convenient medium of communication between restaurant clients and the waiter staff, compared to the current style of physically getting the staff's attention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It responds to voice commands for any service request, such as placing orders, asking for bills, asking for help, etc. It paves the way for the future, where servers and other service staff may not be required, with technology such as this replacing them. This can easily be expanded to many other service industry applications and beyond, such as in hospitals wards, hotel room service, car rental, etc. to save time and streamline a wide variety of services for various clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Amazon Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) frameworks and the Amazon Echo device (a simulator). I have an Amazon Lambda function to process requests. Notifications are sent by Amazon SNS through emails or text messages.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm new to Amazon Alexa and used it for the first time. I'm also new to Amazon Lambda.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to many of the skills I used for this project, I had to learn a lot of it over this weekend.
