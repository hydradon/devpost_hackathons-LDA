                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grew up in low income neighborhoods and graffiti was always a problem, there is "tagging" almost everyday on a house or wall. Street art is sometimes mistaken as graffiti and will get erased or painted over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Differentiate the difference between the graffiti and street art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used machine learning and fed it a bunch of images to be able to differentiate the difference between graffiti and street art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know tensor flow nor did we know machine learning so it was a steep learning curve trying to learn it all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learned how to use machine learning to train images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    machine learning/ tensorflow

                <h2>
                    What's next for Graffiti Locator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the next thing would be making it global and being able to use it all over the world to differentiate the difference. We also plan on making it crowdsourced to be able to have people detect and report the graffiti
