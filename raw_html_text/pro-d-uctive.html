                    We believe that many of the fractures in large assets, such as turbines and power plants, can be discovered before the damage becomes irreversible. For such high-cost systems, it is crucial to detect a seemingly small fracture before it turns into a disaster.

                    Our objective is to prevent severe damages caused by microscopic fractures in assets such as power plants and turbines.
