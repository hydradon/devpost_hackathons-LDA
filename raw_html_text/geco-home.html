                <p>
                    The user can ask Google Home about how to properly dispose of different kinds of waste to promote a more eco-friendly household.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since our application consisted of 3 layers (data mining, natural language processing, and hardware integration), we split the work according to those components. We wrote a Python script to mine data and integrated a waste disposal database into the Google Cloud Platform, particularly Dialogflow and Firebase, to work with Google Home's built-in natural language processing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating different data formats to create our waste disposal database, i.e. web scraping into .csv files, Google Sheets and Firebase into Dialogflow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our ability to work with new tools and concepts, i.e. firsthand experience with Google Cloud Platform, data mining, and integration of natural language processing hardware (Google Home)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Dialogflow to facilitate conversations with Google Home, sync Google Sheets with Firebase, explore data mining strategies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gEco-Home
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding on the Visual Intelligence functionality: by implementing visual sensors of waste being thrown away, gEco-Home will be able to properly identify the item and its proper method of disposal, collecting multidimensional data (time, image recognition and frequency) to observe trends in improper waste management
