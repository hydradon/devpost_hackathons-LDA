                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a short period of 24 hours, we wanted to build something fun. Often times, video games will have fishing minigames that players really enjoy, so we wanted to replicate that feeling on its own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players begin with 30 bobbles and can cast them at a 'fish' and get 10 more for every time it hits. Every time the fish is hit, it changes colors and spawns a smaller, faster fish, making the game harder as the player progresses. The player wins by catching 15 fish before running out of bobbles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to render graphics, build environments, and script game objects. We used Github to share our game.
Shoutout to the UCSD VR club for holding an amazing workshop; that was all we needed to get started and complete our game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever used Unity before, but now we do! 
Scripting was awful at some points due to bugs with objects' Collision property. We were also unable to use a fish model, so we used a ball instead. Also, eventually, the fish move so quickly they teleport.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michelle scripted all the objects and mechanics of the game.
Isabella modeled the terrain, water, modified rendering, and led ideation. This is her first hackathon and first software project!
Karen also worked on the terrain and water.
All of us learned how to use Unity and at least started learning C# (and Microsoft Visual Studio) in a day.
Also, we made a working, legitimate game in just under 24 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us learned Unity and C#, and lots about 3D graphics engines, graphics generation, scripting objects, and plenty more about 3D modeling/game design.
                </p>
