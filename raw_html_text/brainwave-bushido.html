                    Have you ever been inspired by your own brain?

                    If you answered "yes", you probably only said it in your head, ironically, and are also probably just like me. The human brain is a wellspring of untapped knowledge, and a labyrinth whose depths we dare yet to plumb. Our feeble grasps at its depths have yielded few fruits as yet, but the fruits we have harvested are sweet in truth.

                    Well pardner, thats mighty poetic n all, but a man wonders whatchall gone made?

                    True as cows make milk, ain't nothin' been said 'bout that yet. I reckon y'all be achin' to hear that we all gone made the next "plumbob into the maze deeps". Well sorry to say, but that ain't quite right. All we gone done is jerry rig a way to eat the mazes shallower plums at yall's convenience. We gone made an android application which measures y'all think box all the way up. Ain't nothin' on this green earth better than the sound of a dandy gizmo like that. It takes y'all braineywaves and herds all o em into nice categories, and spits out how many of y'all metaphorical cows y'all got. I hear the sciencey types call them the "alpha", "beta", "gamma", and "delta" braineywaves.

                    Sparing the accent, due to the fact that it is excessively hard to get a point across with, we made an app that will measure your brainwaves, and record 'high scores' for a particular category of your choice. It uses the Muse brainwave sensing headbands to sense the brainwaves, and operates on android. Brainwave Bushido operates with the idea that one in control of their emotions can manage to manipulate their brainwaves and get a higher score. The samurai were masters of self-discipline, and that same trait is required for this game.

                    The tempestuous trials of technological tossing-together

                    The construction of a code collaboration of cranial consideration commenced with the contemplation of a contemporary course. Android architecture (android studio) allowed us to activate application adaptation, alongside actual artifice additions. Mightily, mayhap, the Muse mind minder muttered murmurings of misbehaving members in meticulous methods. Settings slapped us stopwise, and setups slowed us stiller, so sentinels we stood, in shaded seconds several. Wondrous and well, we wandered windless when worked our workings of watchful waiting. Gratefully gathering our group of ghoulish grimaces, we grew a grand gatherer of gleaned gestalts.

                        masterpiece
                    </em>
                    there were many challenges that we ran into along the way. First of all, installing the software to enable the use of Muse on Android studios was an... experience. The files took far longer to install than anticipated. To add to the experience,on one of our laptops Android Studio had to be completely reinstalled to be able to accommodate the Muse software. After many hours spent preparing all of the required attachments to support Muse on Android Studio, the process of emulating the applications was a whole new nightmare that truly tested our patience. We also survived countless challenges while correcting errors found in the code, it was often unclear what the cause of the error was, which made finding the solution a laborious time. Once we finally managed to successfully configure Android Studio and run Muse, we ran into new challenges while attempting to use the data we collected and had to use different approaches to complete seemingly simple tasks. However, after many sleepless hours we finally resolved a method to create the app of our minds.

                <p>
                    Sometimes a man's greatest talent is patience. Now, we've been around for a while. Seen men and women with no respect for a leisurely pace. Just can't sit still. Seen others too. People forced into great times of waiting. You grow restless when you've got a time limit, but can't put a foot on the gas pedal. Once, we were those people. We waited. Spent countless hours waiting for things we just couldn't speed up. Makes a person want to give up. Easy to quit when you're going nowhere fast. Us though? Well now. We took our time. The hours we spent in the dark with no sign of rest on the horizon... they weren't the greatest. Frustrating even. Even so, we forged on ahead. Took time. Lots of it. Eventually though, it paid off. We were free, and I'd never been prouder.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well immersing ourselves in the wonders of Android Studio, we improved our knowledge in Java and gained experience in removing errors in code. We also learned the processes of creating an Android app and the methods of putting the whole layout together. Furthermore, we learned how to work with Muse, and gained insight into the workings of brain waves, and how they differ from person to person.

                    Brainwave Bushido: Forwards and Futurewards

                    Everything runs it's course eventually, some sooner than others. Some end up as dead ends, and some as springboards for a new and better world. Some things are retired for a while, only to eventually return to active duty. This project? We think that it has been an amazing learning experience, and an excellent project to work on. That being said, it goes little further than that. In it's current form, we feel it is largely unsuited for further educational use, as it was a delving into multiple areas, with little focus on one in particular. Perhaps it will be a more suitable project when we have developed our skills more, but perhaps other projects will take out interest. Perhaps it is too early to say either way. For now though, we think that into the wild green yonder, Brainwave Bushido will likely venture.
