                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/health/hot-car-deaths-child-charts-graphs-trnd/index.html" rel="nofollow">
                        CNN
                    </a>
                    , since 1998, an average of 36 children have died each year in hot cars, with that number peaking at 49 deaths in 2010, with Southern states accounting for more than three quarters of those deaths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Babyminder uses your phone's accelerometer to detect if you are driving. When it detects that you've reached your destination, Babyminder sends you a push notification, as well as an in-app notification, reminding you to check for your baby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Babyminder is built in Swift using Xcode on macOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking the time selections in the schedule settings from the UI elements to the code behind the scenes was a surprising challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really happy that we were able to make as much progress as we did in a weekend, given that we had never developed for iOS prior to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift and iOS development. And while Swift appears to be a descendent of the C family, it's very much it's own language.
                </p>

                    What's next for Babyminder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvements in the UI, artwork, and notifications.
