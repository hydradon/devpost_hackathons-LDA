                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a social networking website that would make life more fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does not do much right now, because it is not finished. You can only register, login, logout, upload a profile picture,write a post, change information about yourself and change password so far. Therefore, the functionality of adding friends and messaging each other does not work, because two days were not enough for that, but I am planning to continue to work on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS for the Design and PHP for the server-side programming. For the database I used MySQL and phpMyAdmin of the website
                    <a href="http://www.test-demo.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.test-demo.com
                    </a>
                    . I needed to use a lot of external sources, because it was my first time using PHP and MySQL. I watched a lot of videos on youtube and read a lot on different php websites to understand how to connect a website and a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time. I understand now that it is impossible to make a social networking website in two days, because I have not slept half an hour during the hackathon and I still could not finish it, or maybe it was because I was wasting a lot of time looking for functions of mysql and searching how to use php.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My index.php code got deleted 2 times and I had to rewrite it. I was very angry and I wanted to give up so much after 2nd deletion, but I felt bad that I worked so hard and there was only one deletion, so I tried to fix it. It does not function as well as it did before, but it's not bad too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was that I had no idea how to use PHP or MySQL and I had to learn it in 2 days and make a social networking website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I have not slept and I am still awake!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made a new website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned PHP and MySQL!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can say that I learned a lot during this hackathon as how to plan a project, what kind of database is good for the website, how to encrypt information of the website, how to use php for server side programming, how to connect database to website, how to access information in the database and much more...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PicChallenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have to continue working on it, so that it has functions of sending messages, sending friend requests and accepting or declining them, uploading pictures for the albums, being able to delete the pictures and posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main thing that I have to do and it is why I called it PicChallenge is I have to have a calendar for every user and 100 Challenge. If they want to participate in the challenge, they should start completing one challenge every day and the challenges are going to be something like: Take video of pranking your friends, Take a picture with a stranger on the subway and so on...
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would make the social networking website so much fun and after 100 days they would receive a legit video of all the things they did in 100 days so they would have the memories that are captured digitally and maybe someone who has done best in the challenge would receive some kind of gift too after 100 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have not planned it out yet all, because social network is kind of project that develops and develops all the time. There is no full stop for social network, it never ends and I am just in the beginning.
