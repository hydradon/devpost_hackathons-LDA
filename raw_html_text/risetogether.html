                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of newbies and this actually lead us to the inspiration for our idea used in the rise challenge, our lack of knowledge and experiment that we not only had to rely on each other but on others to. Rise is a facility that empowers individuals by providing them with a space to work and innovate, something that many take for granted. We wanted to build appon this by adding a sense of community to a space of talented individuals and allowing them to network and build of each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rise Together is a local area social network that is designed from the ground up to allow individuals to connect with people of differing ability, build together and help one another. Get. Give. It allows users to find others in the rise build that have skills or talents the complement your own, helping you to achieve your goals. It also allows you to build a network of contacts that maybe useful in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built as a web platform to allow easy access on any device that a user may have, we achieved this by using a MySQL database to store user data and create relations and PHP to access, evaluate and update this data. HTML5 Geolocation was used to verify if users were the in rise building or accessing from elsewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all amateurs at best, this was our first hackathon, we are complete stangers, one member of the team had never coded before, and the other half had never seen PHP at all. The odds were heavily stacked against us from the start but we over came these issues and somehow developed something that resembles an actual product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geolocation was a welcome accomplishment that we did not expect, the amount we have all grown as developers in such a short time is astonishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alot, from new languages like PHP and SQL, how to work well with others and share knowledge to the fact that I am now too old to pull an all nighter... twice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RiseTogether
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish, this being a hackathon, there are bugs... lots of bugs and we would like to fix them. On the features side we would like to do more with the information on who is in the building, provide user locations on internal maps and possible add a messenger section
