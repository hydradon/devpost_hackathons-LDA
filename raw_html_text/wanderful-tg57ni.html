                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The summer before college started, all of us decided to take trips to different parts of the world to live our last few days before moving out to the fullest. During these trips, we all figured that there were so many logistics and little things that we needed to worried about in order to have a successful trip, and it created much unneeded stress for all of us. We then came up with the idea to create an app that would streamline the process of planning trips and creating itineraries through simple and convenient features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a travel companion app with functionality such as itinerary generation, nearby search, translation, and currency exchange. The itinerary generator will weigh preferences given by the user, and generate a list of points of interest accordingly. The translator will allow the user to type any phrase in their preferred starting language and output in the language of the country they are in. The user is also allowed to save phrases whenever they would like for quick access. Finally, the currency exchange allows the user to see the exchange rate from their currency to the currency of whichever country they are in, and they are also able to convert between the two currencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using Android Studio. We built the back-end using StdLib, which also made use of other APIs including Google Places, Google Places Photos, Countries API, Fixer.io and Google Translate. The front end utilizes the HERE.com Android SDK to get the location of our device from GPS coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all relatively inexperienced with Android Studio, and thus we spent a lot of time figuring out how to use it but we eventually managed to figure out its ins and outs. There was also an issue with Standard Library and compiling one of our dependencies to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a functional app that is on the verge of being a super powerful traveling tool for people to use when seeing the world. We're also proud of aggregating all the APIs needed to make this hack possible as well as synthesizing all of them within Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned a lot more about utilizing Android Studio, since our hack mostly revolved around its use. Increased experience in Java, including managing asynchronous calls and interactions with the internet were among some of the most valuable lessons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wanderful
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better design is certainly a priority, however functionally the app can be improved within each aspect, such as allowing the user to generate their own itinerary entries, tailoring nearby search to user specifics, increased translating capability, and increased personalization for each user.
