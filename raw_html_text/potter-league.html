                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potter League first started out as a simple game to knock balls off a platform. Earlier, we had the idea to integrate node.js with socket in order to stream accelerometer data from a phone to the web. Using this idea, we could control a game with our phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potter League is a combination of Harry Potter-style Quidditch with the popular game, Rocket League. Players control characters from the Harry Potter universe and have to land their ball in their team's goal. By connecting through a server with their mobile phones, they can control character's individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backbone of Potter League is built with EA's Pathfinder API. Through this API, we are able to stream JSON data from a webpage to Unity. In our case, we stream accelerometer data from our phone to control characters in Unity.
