                    Based on our team's prior experiences, we noticed that there are many people who often need help with technology--whether that be their computer, printer, or any device for that matter. Often, all these people need is someone to help them out and walk them through the basics, so that they too can utilize the wonderful technology all around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to create the TechSupportMatcher to make it easy for people who need assistance using technology to connect with others and gain the help they need. We wanted to make it as simple as possible to get connected with an experienced tech user, and we wanted those willing to help others have an easy way of putting themselves out there for others to see.
