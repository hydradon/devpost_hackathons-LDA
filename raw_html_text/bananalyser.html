                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that tells you whether bananas were ripe or not, and if not ripe, would let you know how long it would to take to ripen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can tell you if a picture has a banana in it.
It can also tell you the flavour of crisps in an image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JS, HTML, CSS, CLARIFAI, and WEBCAMJS.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Api we were using couldn't differentiate between different hues on banana skin accurately enough...
So we pivoted into analysis of chip flavours.
