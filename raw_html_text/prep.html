                <p>
                    Prep is a cross-platform app that ensures your family will be prepared in case of a natural disaster. It keeps track of weather alerts in your area, guides you through packing an supply kit, maps your surroundings, and makes contacting your family a breeze. By providing tips and reminders long before disaster strikes, Prep deters panic and other adverse effects during the inevitable.

                        of American adults have not practiced what to do in a disaster by participating in a disaster drill or preparedness exercise at work, school, or home in the past year. Further, only
                        <strong>
                            39 percent

                        of respondents have developed an emergency plan and discussed it with their household.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    As if this weren't dangerous enough, the Washington Post reported that
                    <em>
                        80 percent
                    </em>
                    of Americans had been living in counties with weather-related disasters for the eight years leading up to the study.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We were all new to this kind of development, and this was the first hackathon for every member of our team! The majority of us are very new to CS, so we had some trouble choosing the tools we should use and then creating the scaffolding to integrate said tools. In particular, we ran into a lot of trouble with the Twilio API, so we ended up not incorporating it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're super excited that our original idea is now a working model. We actually built something that pulls in real location and weather data &mdash;
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    there's an cool checklist! We think an app like this could save lives in natural disasters by making sure families are stocked up with enough supplies to survive until first responders arrive. Our app encourages having a solid plan in place for any disaster situation.

                <p>
                    We would love to continue fleshing out the app's functionality. It would be amazing to get it to a level of production where it serve people in their daily lives. We'd also love to power through and develop that Twilio functionality, despite every error message. The app supposedly works in Android, but we didn't had enough time to test that out &mdash; so we'd love to confirm that when we get the chance!
