                    Over the summer I bought a pair of RGB LED shades from Hackaday, and despite having awesome preprogrammed patterns, I personally didn't think that the shades were worthy of actually wearing to a dance party. I thought in order for me to wear the shades to a party, I would need to have to add sensors, and maybe even produce a phone and smartwatch app to control the patterns on the shades. PennApps was the perfect place for me to research and develop what sensors and hardware I should use to proceed forward with my goal into making the ultimate party electronic wearable.

                <p>
                    With my pair of the RGB shades, Arduino, audio expansion boards, amplifier battery back and audio source (via standard 3.5 mm input or microphone), the walking rave is small and easily transportable system.

                    I knew in order to create a proper synced display for audio, I needed to utilize the Arduino FFT libraries, many of which were confusing to use and timing consuming to implement. I tried the brute force method of tinkering with the library that supports the shades kit, and managed to find a way to utilize the analog inputs, and use properly scaled values via amplifiers, with an audio source and was able to get a nice pattern synced with audio.

                    I did primarily work on the hardware from this project, but I still would have not been able to complete this project without the help of my teammates, who walked me through the programming process and assisting in the building and testing of The Walking Rave.

                    This project refreshed my C programming knowledge and made me aware of the proper syntax again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on possibly taking this project to MHacks and working on the Android Phone/Wear App for my smartphone and watch. In the process of developing these add-ons and capabilities for my RGB LED shades, I can set up the foundation for future developers and enthusiasts who currently own or plan on owning a pair of this one-of-a-kind wearable.
