                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many CS students fit the stereotype of struggling in social situations and we decided to play off this stereotype in our project. We thought it was be interesting to make a programming themed help program for CS students for when they find themselves in these social situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application has a search bar, which takes in user input which searches for related advice based on what the user states is their situation. The program is able to take in a string through the a text box, and the program filters the string for keywords. Using the keywords, the program then compares these with tags which are connected to various help dialogues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program utilizes Java's swing libraries to create the GUI. The program implements the use of JFrames, JPanels, JButtons, and other graphical components. We used the object oriented nature of Java to create various objects and reference them in various classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges we faced was regarding the GUI for the program. We had difficulty with dynamically created buttons on the screen based on the search results from the search bar. We also had some trouble with the displaying the frame based on the size of the screen of the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a fully functioning GUI, that looks clean and simplistic. Also, the search function is able to find results using keywords and tags which is limited to the top five results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored the Java Swing library, and how to effectively debug and problem solve in our code. We learned to work well with a team and how to use each one of our skills, and areas of expertise, to make a cohesive application. We also learned how to adapt our code given the time constraints and great stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Social CS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the list of keywords, and possible make it into either an applet or Android/iOS app, so that it is more convenient and could be accessed on more than one platform.
