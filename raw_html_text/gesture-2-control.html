                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many people in this world who gradually become isolated from their environment. Eventually, the patient reaches such a stage when he is no longer capable to nurture himself and is completely reliant on others. However, this is where our project steps in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use gestures to control objects. Such as toggling lights ON/OFF, making phone calls etc. Our program also locates the current position of the user and then notifies the ambulance and also family members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses OpenCV to detect the gesture and the shape made by the gesture. The program then takes an image of the object the user is looking at which is then sent to the pre-trained inception model to be recognized. Depending on the recognized object an action is taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was recognizing the gesture and tracking the hand movement. It was also a challenge to choose the right pre-trained model.
