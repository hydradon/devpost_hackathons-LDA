                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We picked the task to create a chatbot for an insurance reseller that was supposed to make it possible for them to provide 24/7 customer service and sales. What they don't know is that we wrote it to make their jobs completely obsolete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chatbot will ask you what you want to insure, then ask a series of question until all parameters are filled for it to make an optimal recommendation.
For instance, you can ask it for bike insurance. It will then ask you for things like the type of bike and the area you are living in. In the end it will use that data to query a Firebase to give you the optimal offer for the parameters you set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's DialogFlow and a custom fulfillment script with a Firebase backend. The firebase is filled using a custom Talend ETL Job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using DialogFlow. We didn't read the documentation and only clicked buttons/wrote workarounds until it worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works, it's really fast and easy to maintain - it's actually easy/automatable to add new insurance companies or parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To read the documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Even better Anton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll print the source code on recycling paper, burn it in an eco-friendly fashion, then scrap it.
