                    Coming into HacksGT, I knew my primary goal was not to win but rather learn from the opportunities that my first hackathon can provide for me such as numerous workshops and mentors. Of course, I still tried my best to produce the best product I could make during my short time at GT, and I am personally pleased with what I accomplished.

                    My goal with this project was to learn the in's and out's of full stack development from the front-end of html and css to trying to mess around with back-end technologies such as node.js. Sadly, I was not able to implement node.js into my project and along with that any of the API's I wanted to use. However, this situation allowed me to get a better understanding of the front-end which in retrospect is better as it is impossible to get a good grasp of any back-end technologies in such a short time.

                    The objective of the website came to me on a whim as the specific topic did not matter to me as long as it could represent an online marketplace since I wanted to utilize Capital One's APIs. Therefore since cacti were the first things to pop into my mind, I decided that cacti were the best choice in terms of product to sell on the site.

                    Overall, the product that I am presenting is a representation of my journey of knowledge throughout the weekend and will hopefully impress some people in some way.
