                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2016 election is still, unfortunately, fresh in our mind &ndash; as well as all the accusations of voter fraud, from all sides of the party lines. Even if Trump's claims of "3 million undocumented immigrants voted in California" is untrue, we still haven't had an election with 100% voter representation accuracy.
One reason why the election system is not only vulnerable to things like this, but also extremely slow, can be attributed to the centralization of all the information, and so we decided to pursue this product in hopes to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With technologies available to us, however, it would be practical and easy to incorporate blockchain and decentralize this information, reducing voter fraud and allowing realtime updates of when votes come in.
                </p>
