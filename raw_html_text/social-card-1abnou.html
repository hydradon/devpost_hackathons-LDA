                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After years of attending  hackathon events and networking with lots of people, we noticed that exchanging social media with collaborators was always a cumbersome process, mostly consisting of signing in and out of various platforms. Therefore, we thought that there had to be a better and simpler way to exchange our social media with our peers and we began to turn our concept into reality. After much prior research, we were shocked to see that there was no existing application that matched what we had envisioned; this fact only further motivated us to begin development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is essentially an extension manager of the user's social media. It allows for users to store and manage their social media in a convenient location. It's main purpose, however, is to streamline the process of exchanging various social media outlets between the users of the app. It removes the need to manually exchange usernames by opting to scan for unique QRCodes assigned to the users for each of their social media profiles.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by configuring the database using Laravel and MySQL. Once we had the structure needed to handle our predefine request we moved on to the back-end development. The back-end was creted using Laravel and PHP in order to properly structure the API the front-end of the app was going to use. Then once we had agreed upon what the final product would relatively looked like using primitive hand drawn designs,  the front-end of the application began development. Monaca  was implemented with HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the dynamic elements.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing Monaca mobile application to properly react to the QRCodes and assigning the database values to the QRCodes proved to be rather difficult.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of cutting edge QRCodes with every user and user social media. Learning Monaca and Laravel from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Laravel and Monaca from scratch and how to properly implement QRCodes. But the most powerful lesson we all learned is the value of working as a team through the aid of Github and BitBucket.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Social-Card
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, Social-Card would be a one stop shop for all things social media. Inclusion of news feed for each social media the user uses. As well as incorporation of events into the application where users of the app can easily identify and exchange their social media by signing into the event.
