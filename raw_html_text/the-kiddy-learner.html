                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our love of children. Many of us have siblings and young family members whose educational development we have observed. As we were brainstorming, we decided to capitalize on this passion by creating The Kiddy Learner!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Kiddy Learner is an educational website that displays various scientific cycles with a visual component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners, we ran into many syntax errors. Two team members did not know html, javascript, or css and the learning curve was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished and learned a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two members that did not know the language we coded in, learned the basics of the languages. The whole team learned about the process involved in collaboratively working on a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Kiddy Learner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to learn more javascript and css to make the site more interactive. Also, we would like to be able to add more pages to the website.
