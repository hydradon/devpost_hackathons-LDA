                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw students going to time-consuming surveys and other means to make a few extra bucks. We saw that students were always looking to make extra cash to supplement their daily living, but was hindered by the long hours and commitment required to work in restaurants part-time while juggling their intense academic schedules. We also saw businesses struggling in rush times and when unexpected changes came their way. Our goal was to change that by creating a system where students could make money on their

                    time, and business can have access to a pool of talented, hard-working individuals, at any given time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team also researched that according to a research study done by Georgetown University,
                    <strong>
                        70%
                    </strong>
                    of college students in the United States work while studying. TempIT will be able to help increase serve this large percentage by making their academic-work life even more balanced.

                <p>
                    Given this great demand for part-time workers and college students&rsquo; large role in this market, TempIT aims to connect employers and employees in the hourly job marketplace. With the various part-time job opportunities in college, college students will be able to maximize their work times by selecting the times they can work, and better manage their work-study-life balance. For employers, this provides them an access to a large pool of willing students to fill in schedule gaps, assist workers, and more.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build our Web App, we first built the framework for all our pages using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Our team understands the importance of a clean and simple UX, and dedicated time to making sure it was a very aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. For our back-end, we used Python and JavaScript with Flask and Firebase to maintain the server-side of our project. We utilized the Firebase Authentication API to successfully create and manage users for our site. We also used Firebase to store user information, job listings, and more to a Real-time Database. We then had to use Flask to read from our Firebase database and dynamically update our HTML source code to reflect the actual information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that we ran into was learning many new technologies and languages in a short time frame. Most of our team had basic experience with web development and had to learn how to use Firebase and Flask and then apply it immediately to our hack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we had was linking all of our various components together with ease. To be efficient in our work, most of our team members split up different components of the whole project. However, the problem with this was that sometimes different components would lack a certain consistency in style and logic, and brought up some issues while merging all the files together.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that TempIT has the ability to tackle a real problem that can greatly impact the lives of students as well as businesses. We are proud that we were able to create a finished product at MHacks that shows the proof of concept of this idea, and is the start of something big.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of our ability to manage and deal with users efficiently. We were able to store all of our user data in Firebases databases, and then retrieve that data to create an easy to use UX. We are also proud of our data-handling since the whole concept of this idea is built heavily on the idea that there will be lot's of data to sort and filter through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the design of Web Applications in general as well as the various mechanisms to communicate between different databases and languages. We had to process data in JavaScript, write to our databases with Python and ultimately render our HTML based on our reads. We learned a lot about how to actually create client-facing applications that have several different components in them. Unlike academic computer science, where everything is under the scope of a single language, we learned how to work on various different streams of work with multiple people and ultimately combine them all to create a final project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TempIT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working on TempIT after MHacks, and ultimately bring it to market in the near future. One feature we are looking to add is a Recommendation system that uses ML techniques to recommend Job Listings to students that would benefit them the most. We also plan to add more security features in the to our application to make it more robust and also improve our UX. All in all, we are very happy to have had the opportunity to build the first iteration of TempIT at MHacks and hope we bring this product to life and impact students and businesses around the United States and beyond.
