                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you leave a tip at a restaurant after paying with a credit/debit card, the final price of the meal is not finalized until the waiter manually adds the tip after you have left. This definitely leaves room for the waiter to possibly tamper with your tip and give themselves more credit than they were actually award. However, many times we don't realize if this happens since we usually don't keep tabs on our purchases and often forget of how much we had actually spent at a restaurant if the difference is minuscule. This led me to creating Just the Tip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just the Tip monitors your bank account after you input the amount you spent at a given place and includes any tip added to that amount. After the final transaction is placed, Just the Tip will ensure that there is no overcharge on your account, especially focusing on the total you had spent at the place where you left a tip. If Just the Tip notices that you were overcharged it will alert you using the website or your Alexa assistant to run a quick check on your account to detect fraud or send a push text with the analysis of your account.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and Python to create the user interface, and in it made use of the Nessie API to create the merchant transactions. We also made use of  CSS, Flask task, AWS, and Twillio for the Alexa portion.

                <p>
                    One of the hardest challenges to overcome was getting the Alexa assistant to work properly when registering commands.

                <p>
                    Providing proof of concept for a program that will help consumers become more aware of the transactions that are run through their financial accounts.

                <p>
                    Quality over quantity. Focus on one idea and spend as much time as possible on it rather than incorporating more ideas into one project.

                <p>
                    Making it more user friendly, and adding more features such as incorporating a more financial information of the user.
