                    Inspiration was a previously created app for work.The objective of this application was to give data that would be helpful to the user based on their needs so they would be able to get everything they need and then to promptly get them started on path they would need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First thought of data and information that would be needed from the user so we could provide them with useful information that would fit their needs. Thought of how not to confuse people who would need to use the app. We did this by making most of the options lists instead of user inputted data. This also simplified the output data making it easier to read and manipulate. Using the spreadsheets we created of hotlines and locations that would be of assistance to anyone who would possibly need it, in conjunction with the user data we collected. We selectively picked what they would nee and returned it based of the user's data. The user's demographic is also stored for data collection purposes.

                    There were several challenges that snagged valuable time. One being that while we were intially going to use meteor.js, no one in the group was truly familiar with it. Another issue is that no one within the group has ever done this before which in turn caused miscommunication among the team at several points.

                <p>
                    The final product has the capability to touch on the four problems easily. Due to the simplistic design the program has more room to expand and adjust to the needs. The largest accomplishment is that we have a working demo of what we were going to do and how easily would be to expand to what ever it may be that would be easily added and adjusted into the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned that working as a team could e difficult at times and that design restraints do happen and to work with what we got. Stick to your strengths and don't try to be what you aren't able to. Provide better information for the programmers and to be able to convey the thoughts of everything more knowledgeable.

                    The next step would to be to refine it and make a better and more stable version. Possibly make it nation wide and branch it out to where it could prove have more helpful tools for the user to have at their disposal based off their needs.
