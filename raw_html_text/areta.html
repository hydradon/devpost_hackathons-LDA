                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone remembers that one time when a perfect gift was ruined by vague instructions. Of course, this problem is easily solved by AR, which can demonstrate the instructions to the users in real life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses augment reality to animate any instruction plan. For example, it's extremely difficult to make the instructions for building a model airplane intuitive. Our app will animate these instruction so customers no longer have the pain of ruining their favorite toys!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated Vuforia SDK's object recognition capabilities to capture the location of the required parts in the real world. We make it easy to encode a series of instructions for the retailer. Finally, we use complex linear algebra to calculate the start and end points of objects that need to move, and display the object in their final location.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating image recognition is difficult!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made image recognition work!
