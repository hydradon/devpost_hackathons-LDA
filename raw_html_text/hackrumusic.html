                <h2>
                    We have developed an Android app called "How RU Feeling?" that we hope will be helpful for Rutgers students and faculty.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clicking on one of seven mood buttons (paired with a suitable mood image) sends you to a Rutgers-related URL link to fit, well, your mood!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Examples:
                    </em>
                    Feeling sleepy? You'll be sent to the RWBJ Sleep Center website to register for an appointment.
Feeling unmotivated? You'll be sent to the Rutgers 250 anniversary video that they play at orientation to give you some inspiration.
We also have an "Emergency" button that sends you to a Rutgers counseling website with contact information for various problems.
We hope that if students are feeling a certain way, good or bad, they can use our app to get some help, a mental boost, or even crack a smile (click our Happy button if you want to know).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How RU Feeling? also has a social aspect to it!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has built-in SMS messaging to share your moods with friends as well as the URLs you yourself were directed to.
We planned to implement a notification system to remind you to do this, and we also wanted to have the URL
autogenerate in the text message input, but sadly we did not have time to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Spotify API was attempted as well to try to play music to fit the mood. Implementing the Spotify playlist took a really long time
and headache and yet is not the prominent aspect of the app. It isn't implemented with the rest of the app
because Spotify was the original idea and was sidelined by the Rutgers stuff. We were thinking about having background music play, but we again 
didn't have time to implement this. So if you find some crazy Spotify API stuff in our code and you're wondering why it's 
there, now you know!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a lot we wanted to add to this app because we believe it has a lot of potential. One idea we wished to add was having multiple URLs for each mood, and a button click will randomly send you to one of those links. That way the app doesn't get stale. Another idea was that if every single Rutgers student used this app, we could track which buttons are pressed more often and when. We can use that data to track the collective mood of the entire Rutgers population!  While we ran out of time to implement these ideas, we are happy with the framework that we developed in this short time frame.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Thank you for taking the time to look at our app! #Rutgers spirit!
