                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've played similar clue-based password games in the past, which is what I was inspired by
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game, you enter numbers to guess the password and it tells you clues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python script
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding what to do beforehand, so this was kind of a last-ditch effort - it's really very simple in general
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting it done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to plan beforehand more, otherwise, we have no idea what we're doing
                </p>

                    What's next for Password Hacker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably nothing, maybe a few small updates
