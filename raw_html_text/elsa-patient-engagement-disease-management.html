                    Global Health Impact:
Asthma is a serious and widespread disease, affecting 300 million worldwide with cost to society over $50 billion per year in US healthcare expenses, missed school and work days, and early death. Childhood asthma has sky-rocketed in inner cities.

                    Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), which afflicts 100,000 Americans, is the most common inherited blood disorder in the US. In 2004, there were about 113,000 hospitalizations for sickle cell related illnesses in the United States, 75% occurring in adults. Estimated annual cost of hospitalization that year was $488 million.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elsa is a mobile-friendly patient engagement platform for health education, best practices for self care and prevention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    80% of risk factors reduced by:   LIFESTYLE = EAT SMARTER + MOVE MORE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all need someone that can act as our mirror and help us see things that we may not otherwise see and hold us accountable to those purposes that we have set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating a culture that engages best practices shows the most effective promise for social change to prevent the incidence of much earlier and in greater numbers than any device may amount to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gamification will magnify patient conscienciousness for optimal results by creating conversations:
Who is your mentor... accountability partner? How is it working? Do more of this...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge is to track and manage care and reduce risk factors:
Self-care and education
Early Diagnosis and best practice preventive strategies 
Improved health outcomes
Our goal is decreased incidence of complications and for escalation triggers when necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are targeting partnerships with Texas Children&rsquo;s Hospital to use our application as tool for mutual objectives.
                </p>

                    We will use partnerships like these to target their constituents:
