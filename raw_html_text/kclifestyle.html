                    Purpose/Idea of program:
&bull; Target market is students (especially KCL students during wellbeing week)
&bull; Use the app once a day to track your wellbeing
                </p>
                <p>
                    4 main sections:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mood:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a day, submit how you are feeling, using emojis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        App will give advice (in pop-up boxes) depending on your mood
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the future, if the user selected &lsquo;Very Happy&rsquo;, then the user could have the option to open social media to post a picture of their great day or talk about it
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the future, if the user selected &lsquo;Very Happy&rsquo;, the user could have the option to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Activity:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User inputs what exercises they have done during the day and for how long
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is used to give the user an overview of the exercise that they have done recently
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the future, we could link the data to &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Be Active&rsquo; and wearables like FitBits
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Useful as doing a good amount of exercise has been linked to having good wellbeing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Food:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User inputs the total amount of water and fruit they have eaten in a day
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Helps user to think about this &amp; students may be busy thinking about work too much
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Study:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Good to remember to take a break now and then
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A countdown till the user&rsquo;s next break
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the future, the user can choose a song to be played at the end of the countdown/study session, therefore encouraging the user to take a break (for well being)
                    </li>
