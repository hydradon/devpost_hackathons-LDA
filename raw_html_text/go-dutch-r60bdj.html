                    As a team, we have heard many stories as well as experienced going Dutch with our friends but
                    <em>
                        forgetting soon after to pay one another or be paid by one another
                    </em>
                    . This resulted in
                    <strong>
                        unnecessary additional expenditure
                    </strong>
                    as well as difficulty in tracking one's true personal expenditure, making it more difficult for one to plan one's finances. The additional inconveniences of losing receipts also make tabulating our expenditure even harder. Thus, we sought to develop an application that allowed one to easily record and track our expenditure in the
                    <strong>
                        most convenient way

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We employed the use of OCR to digitally analyze and convert receipts into text files. We found that Tesseracts as an OCR Engine was not sufficiently trained to recognize the unique fonts typically used in receipts. As a result,
                    <strong>
                        we trained the OCR Engine ourselves
                    </strong>
                    to be better suited to read receipts. We then
                    <strong>
                        used Wit.Ai to detect the relevant information
                    </strong>
                    and wrote a
                    <strong>
                        Python script to filter through the text
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into was obtaining an open-source OCR engine, let alone one with
                    <em>
                        sufficient accuracy
                    </em>
                    . As such, this resulted in us having great difficulty in training Tesseract to
                    <strong>
                        increase its ability to detect and read receipts
                    </strong>
                    . This problem was especially prominent when Tesseract had to attempt to differentiate between the alphabet 'l', the numerical value '1', and the symbol ']'.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn how to
                    <strong>
                        use and train OCR
                    </strong>
                    as well as set up our own FTP as a temporary data storing method for the prototype in the short span of 24 hours while producing a
                    <strong>
                        satisfactory UI

                    in what we do, pursuing excellence in the greatest depth and greatest breadth despite our limitations. On top of that, understanding our own limitations and embracing our strengths allowed us to shape our project to each other's strengths, fully maximising the potential of every member. We were organized and clear on our shared goals from the beginning and we learned how important it was as we had a very smooth time together, hacking, eating and just enjoying each other's company. We should also
                    <strong>
                        not belittle ourselves
