                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've seen how video games can intro us to new topics and fields through our own lives in games such as lemonade stand, madden, guitarband, etc. We wanted to pass it on to the next generation by creating a farming simulator that would rewrite the narrative on modern-day farming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    e-i-e.io is an educational farming simulation that promotes environmentally responsible practices and showcases the innovative scope of information technology. It allows people to select plots of land and grow crops in a multi-layered environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented e-i-e.io with React.js, Node.js, HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the John Deere Tech Talk about React.js, we were inspired to use it for the first time. Aligning features on the front-end and navigating through a new library for the back-end were among the challenges we ran into. Wiring the UI elements to the functionality in an object-oriented way was also a difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of tapping into our creative sides and designing all of the icons ourselves. A particularly incredible accomplishment was how we were able to provide an executable based on a foreign framework based on farming research. Oh, and Zumba, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React.js, Sass, JSX, gravit designer tools, Git
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for e-i-e.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking forward, some of our plans for improving
                    <strong>
                        e-i-e.io
                    </strong>
                    is to add more terrain types to simulate a real geographic region. Also, we want to add in more explicit nutrient needs for each crop as this is a key concern for many farmers. Lastly, we want to showcase in some way how environmentally friendly technologies can not only help save the environment but also money in the long-term. In addition we can possibly partner with a large manufacturer, so the game could be a sponsored promotion of a company's products.
