                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mustafa is from Afghanistan and Juan Jos&eacute; from Guatemala. Upon meeting at the registration table on March 2nd 2019, we both quickly realized that we were both interested in developing a Social Good project that could be applicable to some of the major challenges we face in our respective homes. Upon some brainstorming, we stumbled upon the NIH Dataset
                    <a href="https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/36938765345" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    .  The number of diseases labeled in the dataset made it extremely enticing to work with. After doing some online research, we realized that lung and respiratory related diseases were a leading cause of death for people around the world. Additionally, we also found out that there is a shortage of X-ray technicians worldwide, especially in developing countries around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In light of these facts, we decided to take action toward bridging the X-ray technician gap around the world by using Artificial Neural Networks for the process of diagnosing lung diseases. The main application of a predictive model for such diseases would be in places where there are little or no X-ray technicians at all. Therefore, in order for the product to be accessible for even the most remote areas in the world, we decided to bring the power a predictive model using an Artificial Neural Network via SMS.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overarching infrastructure of the model is basically such that we have a phone number that is listening for images to be sent over SMS. On the server side, we have a pre-trainned tensorflow DenseNet model with the data from the NIH.  Once we receive the image, we feed it to a pre-trained model and get a prediction for the diseases. We text the respective predictions to the message-sender and prepare the model for the next incoming image.
