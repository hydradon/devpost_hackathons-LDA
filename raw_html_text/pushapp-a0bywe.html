                    Inherently lazy, humans don't work unless they are incentivized and held accountable somehow. 
PushApp motivates you to get out of bed in the morning, by creating an initial countdown that doesn't leave you the choice of waiting another 5 minutes in bed. To hold you accountable, it tracks your performance each day to give you an idea of your progress.

                    4/5 of our team being baby hackers, our limited expertise slowed us down at times and we referred to online forums quite a bit. Challenges were merging our different research, in particular implementing the timing of the notification.

                    Given our previous knowledge - heck yeah we did well!! And all of us learned something new every single minute spent on the screen.

                    Next features to implement are a photo feature as well as the actual graphs to track the process.
