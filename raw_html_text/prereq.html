                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all stressing about figuring out course schedules, and then we realized that this inevitable part of the student experience was actually something we could solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PreReq provides a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; for students unsure of what prerequisites are required to take certain courses as well as those uncertain of how to go about pursuing concentration requirements, while still allowing them to take advantage of Brown&rsquo;s Open Curriculum and the many fascinating courses that Brown has to offer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Ajax to scrape pertinent course information from Courses@Brown as well as the Critical Review, and used MySQL to store that information in a database. We then utilized Java to parse the information, and produce both a visual tree representative of the necessary prerequisites a certain course has, as well as a table depicting the recommended course load a student should take based on their concentration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compatibility between course database and Java, getting the web crawler to work, as well as coding the algorithm to create an optimal course schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an innovative idea that will hopefully be useful to everyone in the Brown community for years to come!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to effectively web crawl, how to store and manage large data sets, how to collaborate and communicate effectively, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PreReq
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend current application to all Brown concentrations and currently-offered courses
Provide greater degree of customizability of input (i.e.  course ratings,  average hours per week,  desired professors, etc.)
Build on existing graphical user interface in order to streamline user experience
Flesh out implementation of semester course scheduler, taking into account students&rsquo; goals (undecided vs. 1 concentration vs. 2 concentrations), difficulty of course load, elective classes based on academic interests, and more
