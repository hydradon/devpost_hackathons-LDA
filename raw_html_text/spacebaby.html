                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think SpaceEngine is pretty cool, but find the fact its Windows only limiting. Why not make it available to more people as a webapp?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpaceBaby currently provides a rudimentary scale model of the Solar System, with ambitions to map all of NASA's available data on the Universe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built SpaceBaby in Javascript, specifically using the Babylon.js WebGL API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics for modeling even rudimentary orbits in the Universe turned out to be significantly difficult - quickly expanding into the realm of employing Kepler's Laws. Thankfully we had a physicist on our team, though we were marred by the limitations of the API of our choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even getting the Solar System modeled as far as we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use WebGL in a basic way, and hopefully, for the future, when to abandon an API that doesn't fulfill our expectations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spacebaby
                </h2>
                <p>
                    General relativity and pure WebGL.
