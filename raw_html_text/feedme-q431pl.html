                    About $130B of food is wasted every year in the US and 1 in 6 person does not know where his next meal is coming from. So why not feed the hungry instead of throwing the food away
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Big part of food wastage is done by restaurants. The app would allow the restaurants to post about the food that they are going to throw away and for a given time frame, they would offer the food for free because they were about to throw it anyway. Everybody using the app would be able to see whatever food is available and its location. They can grab the food from there in that time
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned app design and development strategy, the programming that goes into these apps and how to generate revenue out of the apps
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We can somehow merge grocery stores into the app so that the amount of food they waste can be reduced
