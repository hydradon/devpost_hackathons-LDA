                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We Tried to focus on the perspective of the victims of the atrocious events taking place across the country and even in our hometown. We quickly realized that for any victim away from home it would be a clear struggle to get the medical treatment they need as they don't have ready access to their medical documents. We also realized that once we have this patient medical information we can anonymize it and securely provide it to meaningful research institutions with research studies willing to compensate willing participants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Project serves as a way for patients to access their records quickly and easily as well as transfer them between care centers, physicians, and doctors. This also serves as a way of connecting patients willing to consent their information to research institutions that are in need of patients to conduct their studies.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our front end solutions in angular and flutter for a web app and cross platform mobile solution. We built the backend in firebase and connected everything related to research to the public blockchain we built.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to build the full front end functionality due to a late start on the implementation side of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the public blockchain network completely operational and configured for the front end, even if it wasn't fully connected in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the medical space suffers from a lack of standardization and adoption for EHR's and storage systems.
                </p>

                    What's next for SwiftDoc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate Doctor validation, integrate fully with the blockchain network, connect all of the user flows for the Doctor and Researcher user personas.
