                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recall a time when I had trouble remembering people's names.  I would walk into a room with new people, meet a couple, and perhaps only remember 1 or 2 names.  Thus, I wanted to create an app that would solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects the faces of whoever is in the taken photograph, and boxes the faces.  Then you can assign names of the people and it will display on screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an API called Microsoft Azure, an API that detects faces when given an image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to find out a way to box the faces, and to do that, I had to download the image on the phone and upload it to Firebase 2 times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I ran my app and the faces appeared on the screen with boxes on them, I was more than excited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that although coding may be strenuous and tedious at times, when everything works correctly, it is worth it in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remember Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add a quizzing feature that will quiz the user on the names of the people whose faces are on the screen.
