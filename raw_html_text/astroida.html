                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been working with SpriteKit for a week or two now and really wanted to see what I could accomplish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes UIBezierPath and CoreMotion to complement a fierce mixture between dodging and destroying asteroids
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using SpriteKit for 2D iOS animation, and some stock png images from the internet, the UIBezierPath checks if any SpriteNodes are in its path and removes these references.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially the spaceship could run off screen into infinity, so I had to rewrite some code to prevent the SpriteNode from going off the frame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to implement CoreMotion with the help of the Apple team, which was a framework I had never touched or utilized before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The viewcontroller life cycle for a spritekit scene is much different than the default user interface kit
                </p>
