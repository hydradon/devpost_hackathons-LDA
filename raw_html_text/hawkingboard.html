                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Stephen Hawking, there are plenty of great minds amongst those with impaired physical mobility.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HawkingBoard empowers users who have difficulty using normal keyboards by serving as a minimal-cost, minimal-dexterity, full-featured keyboard that is controlled with 1 point of contact. With just a single touch, this tool equips them with the ability to code or write a book.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fusion of hardware and software.

                <h4>
                    Hardware:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Circuit + Arduino + C, connected via USB to a PC, which appears as a HID Keyboard Device
                </p>
                <h4>
                    GUI:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    C# and Winforms to display background keystroke translation for user reference
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Bridging:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    AHK to translate hardware input into keystrokes

                    Challenges we ran into

                <h4>
                    Hardware:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Being new to hardware, circuits and arduino. Damaged diodes and components. Limited hardware equipment. Sensitivity/fragility of components. Solder not attaching to USB connector.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Software:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Being new to AHK. C# unable to detect background keystrokes and having to hook to kernal keypress. Accurately timing keypresses (e.g. key up, key down for different forms of input). Differentiating between different keystrokes. Sending special keys and modifier keys. Integrating different aspects of the project together (e.g. hardware to software).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first hackathon, the time pressure was real but we're glad we could complete in time. We also overcame our lack of experience in the tools used and learnt new skills in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware knowledge. GUI. Hooking keystrokes in background. Keystroke manipulation.
