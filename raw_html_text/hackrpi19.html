                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to enable people to have an easy way to donate to reputable &amp; established charities that support people in need during various natural disasters.

                <p>
                    We used python programs to web scrape lists of disasters and some available charities. In addition, we used angular and Rest API's to create a functional website.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon so we didn't have a lot of experience going in. We spent a lot of time researching how to use a web scraper and finding suitable websites to gather data from. We also spent time looking at how to create a functional website with angular. We had multiple issues with the website we wanted to get charity data from (API) as there was an "Access Control Allow Origin" error which was essentially saying that the website's server wouldn't allow cross-origin resource sharing.
