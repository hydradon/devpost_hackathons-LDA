                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gentrification is a big problem in society that is not well known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are escaping the tragedies of gentrification. Try to beat the cost of living by collecting as many coins as possible. Use the up and down arrow key to collect the coins. Each coin is worth 5 points. At the end of the game, you need to have an equal amount or more points than what your house costs. You will face obstacles through out your run, where you may have to pay bills, face construction, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can donate money to a charity at the end and tweet about us to raise awareness of this problem.
