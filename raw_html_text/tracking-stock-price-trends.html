                    We wanted to pretend that we are financial analysts with a stock portfolio that has several different sectors and thus, is exposed to macro variables and other events. Our goal was to compare individual stocks to the sector that they pertain to and figure out if they are behaving normally or abnormally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By normal, we would expect the stock to move in the same direction as the overall sector, making the conclusion that that stock was being influenced by macroeconomic forces/events. By abnormal, we would expect the stock to move in a different direction, not following the ebb and flow of the overall sector and other stocks within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As financial analysts, if that stock is not trending with its peers, we would want to identify company-specific events that may be isolating its performance. So we wanted to create a code to filter financial news that pertain to that particular stock, that way, as a financial analyst, it would be easier to track headlines and get a better understanding of what may have happened overnight.
                </p>

                    We used Quandl to import financial data for sector ETFs and all U.S. equities. We built a platform that compares the weekly price change of each individual stock to the sector it pertains to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we created a code that browses financial news headlines and filters the top stories pertaining to the stock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge was normalizing the data and being able to organize it in a way that it was informative and brought us to a conclusion. Another challenge was getting familiar with APIs to be able to build the platform to filter the news search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to work together and utilize each others' skill set to accomplish our goal. It was challenging as we have different backgrounds and experience; however, we kept open communication and were able to further brainstorm and come up with new ideas and/or approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We actually mentioned that even if we weren't able to finish this within the time period, we would be interested in continuing to build this project and incorporate even more ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though we weren't able to upload our project, we would like to present the different components of it in person.
