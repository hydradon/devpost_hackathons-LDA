                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were just brainstorming random ideas in the beginning, then one member of our team mentioned an a bunny that would follow your schedule and remind you of the things you should do on a daily basis. Then, as we were thinking about names for the app, someone else said "Potato Bunny," which led to just simply "Potato," in which there is a potato instead of a bunny reminding you of everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You set a schedule for your potato based on your own schedule, from eating to sleeping to exercising. The potato will pop up and notify you that it is doing its task, and that you should as well. You can select different modes for your potato as well, like bunny mode and tomato mode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up into three teams: front-end, back-end, and design. The front-end focused on creating the views of the app, while the back-end created the swift code for the app. The design group created the different potato and mode images and images for the icons. We put all three parts together and created Potato.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many merge conflicts, and sometimes things just don't work even when they worked a minute ago.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a presentable product.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 hours may or may not be enough to create a comprehensive app that works completely as planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Potato
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create more modes for the potato, fix bugs, and perhaps make your potato grow throughout the day or week so that you would have a potato tree (because potatoes grow on trees) by the end of the day/week, and start the next day with a fresh potato.
