                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became frustrated with how many domains have been taken by failed startups and domain squatters looking for an easy cash out.  When I discovered that ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com wasn't already taken, I was in ecstasy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, this website shares a reenactment of how I felt when I discovered that ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com wasn't already taken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made this website with HTML, CSS, and my iPhone's front facing camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was heavily sleep deprived (not because of the hacking, but because of my large intake of Soylent Coffiest), so I eventually reached a point in hacking where I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or actually coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the fact that I bought ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com for $0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an adequate selfie taker.
                </p>

                    What's next for ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully Elon Musk invents a time machine soon so I can go back in time to the moment I found out that ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com wasn't already taken and take an actual photo of myself reacting to the fact that ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com wasn't already taken and then use that photo as the new background for ICantBelieveThisDomainIsntTaken.com.
