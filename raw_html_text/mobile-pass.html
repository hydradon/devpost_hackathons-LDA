                    Mobile Pass changes the way parking lot payment has worked for decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your smartphone will become your wireless ID for the Mobile Pass system using your phone's bluetooth technology to identify your user account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barriers in parking lots will have a device that will detect when users registered in the Mobile Pass system are approaching, using bluetooth technology in the user's phone, and will allow the user to pass without the need of printing a ticket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user leaves the parking lot, the barrier will again detect the user via bluetooth as he or she approaches the barrier, and it will raise to let the user out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind the scenes the Mobile Pass system authenticates the user, generates a record of the time of entry, time of exit, and rate of the parking lot, and charges directly to the user's credit card accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can view all your transactions in the Mobile Pass App and keep track of how much money you spend on parking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is not intended for entertainment purposes or for casual use, it is intended to be of real use, something that people in general will use on a regular basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system would save you time you waste waiting in line to pay in the ticket machine or cashier, huge amounts of paper would be saved from being wasted by the ticket machines to print tickets, and the boom barriers in parking lots would become part of the internet of things.
