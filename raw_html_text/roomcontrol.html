                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to sleep with my window open.  My housemates prefer to b̶u̶r̶n̶ m̶o̶n̶e̶y̶  use the AC.  I wanted to have a way for them to know the state of my room, without them actually having to go in it.  Originally, I thought an LED on the door would work, but why stop there?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has room-level customization of settings, as well as "parent" permissions, allowing parents to change and override room settings.  Initial planning includes features such as localized wifi hotspots with integrated ip table blocking, lighting control, and support for some plugins like speaker, temperature sensors, door and window sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Raspberry Pi, Snapdragon, and other IoT devices to create a mesh network of devices to work in tandem with each other.  Using Java to "normalize" the software, with the design of three components: master server to manage the permissions of all the rooms, the room's software itself, and the client software for users to configure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapdragon had defaulted to Windows 10 IoT
Time constraints: My initial project idea turned out to be wildly unfeasible.  I didn't find that out until a bit too late into the event to fully flesh out this idea.

                    I wasn't able to get much more than basic device controls working due to time constraints.
