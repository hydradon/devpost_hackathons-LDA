                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are often bombarded with life challenges and don't quite know how to tackle them. For this reason, we want to create an app that teaches us how to deal with real life situations, which are crucial skills that are not usually gained from schools. The most important thing that Learn to Live is trying to teach users in this world of perfection, is to keep going even if you feel like you failed, because failure can open up a gate of opportunities and teach you a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is an interactive life simulation that puts users in realistic challenges. In each situation, they have three options to choose from, and each option affects the statistic of the player, which consists of social, time, and money management skills. As you progress in the game, you will earn more points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GameMaker studio 2, Figma, and Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a bit challenging to work under pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with an idea in a short time with the cooperation of our mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to cooperate effectively, and work under pressure as a team. These are important skills to develop whether we are working in an organization, or in a group in a school or university.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn to Live
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a prototype for now, but later on, we will create more challenges, skills and levels.
