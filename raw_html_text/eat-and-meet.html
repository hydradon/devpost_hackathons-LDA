                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this project because we wanted to help people that were in the same situation as us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is at a very basic level currently, since we do not have many skills in C++ yet. Right now the program allows the user to create a profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had planned on including a search option, but we had some trouble figuring out as to how we could access a particular person's details, such as phone number later on in the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eat and Meet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would be definitely implementing the search option so that users can find other users to meet up with. Also, we were thinking of using files to save the user's information to a text file, rather than only to an array, for use even when the program is not running.
