                    Problem:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Password authentication is a hassle and insecure. Creating a strong, unique password is difficult and so is remembering passwords. As a result, most people usually end up using the same password for all their accounts and saving or writing down their passwords. As such, passwords can be often be easily guessed or hacked (for example if you make an account on a shady site with your usual password), and mounting security challenges force websites to keep stepping up their password requirements - forcing ever more complex passwords with more and more symbols, numbers, and uppercase characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another seemingly unrelated problem is in-flight entertainment systems - unresponsive, dirty and lacking any personalization. Our team decided to tackle this issue as well, and in general issues with conventional touch control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use a more organic interface to simplify the login process. We used a Leap Motion controller, to develop SwipeIn, a novel control and authorization platform that allows you to simply swipe into your website or app. SwipeIn is especially useful in public places, like at ATMs, airports, or during flight - without the risk of tapping your password in plain view of potential attackers. By recognizing your hand shape and gestures, SwipeIn authorization is much easier to remember, more difficult to copy, and more secure.
