                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration was brought from several areas, but generally we mapped out all of the pain-points that exist in the modern Airport formats in terms of travel, and narrowed it down to three key areas that we wanted to conceptualize around.  We were inspired by the security scene in the movie total recall, the Shangi Airport in china, and trends we've seen around brands activating spaces across retail.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The driving theme to our concept is an express lane in security enabled by AI Stride-recognition paired with milimeter wave emitting devices embedded into the environment to do the work of checking individuals entering the terminal area for weapons.  When paired with emerging services that allow you to send your luggage ahead of your travel plans, or utilize curated wardrobe services at destinations, it allows the opportunity for travelers to enter the terminal luggage free and accompanied by loved ones without the stress of sitting in line waiting for the TSA.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at various design trends and emerging technology to develop the concepts for the three areas to transform the airport into a destination.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overwhelming amount of logistical considerations that happen when approaching redesigning an airport, we really had to quickly hone in on what moments during air travel we could tackle and make the largest impact.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created some really beautiful illustrations, I feel like our solution takes into consideration the TSA employees as well as travelers, and the implication of travelers traveling with less in general has serious implications to how it could positively effect the rest of air travel.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the best approach to designing a solution is when you're able to encourage behavior that rewards the rest of the environment/system that it exists in.

                    If the idea were to go further there would be a deep-dive on specific journey moments for each area.
