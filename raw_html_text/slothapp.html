                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so busy with school that we do not have time to plan the weekends. We also do not want to worry about planning it out and getting stressed out with the budget, time, and location. We decided to build an app that takes care of these issues that we think people may face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suggest and plan your day according to your availability and preference. Then, it will choose the shortest and best itinerary using the acquired destination through user's preference and Yelp.
All selections will be filtered to ensure your destinations please you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finish the HTTPS calling infrastructure to connect with a url using JSON, also we managed to create a functional app that shows the gathered information and displays it in a ordered list. However we did not managed to connect with Yelp's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all new to the Android development platform and also to Java programming language, creating a HUGE learning curve to implement a functioning app. 
We had connectivity issues with GitHub and exchanging code was difficult but we managed by resolve the problems after the Github workshop.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functioning app which only displays the information, we uploaded an amazing drawing in our launcher icon and we learned basic Android development which encourage us to learn more and do more apps in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do Android development and Java.

                    What's next for MeSloth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand upon MeSloth and add Geotagging, other APIs (like trip advisor) and possibly our personal calendars. We want to create a tool that does all the scheduling for us and we just focus at the tasks we need to accomplish.
