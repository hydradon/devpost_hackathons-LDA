                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just wanted to create something fun and interactive as well as learn new skills while we tried to survive staying awake for 23 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play as the Clemson Tiger while you dodge school mascots, facing Nick Saban and the Roll Tide in the final level all while trying to please Godly Dabo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used pygame and python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making our character jump as well as registering collisions with enemy characters!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole game! Both of us came in with no Python experience and we created something to show our friends and family, as well as the judges!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to handle frustrating errors and lack of sleep/motivation, as well as general programming concepts with Python and pygame
                </p>
