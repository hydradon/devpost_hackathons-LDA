                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to control the characters of a game with just blinking my eyes.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is about a traveler who is trying to collect fruits, and there are cursed pirates trying to stop him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built using the Spark AR Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran by many ideas, just narrowing it down to a practical one was very difficult. As it became challenging to run the prototype. However we were successful in achieving the current result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    Control the character by just blinking and learning Spark AR.
