                <p>
                    Now this is the story all about how
A team flipped youtube upside down
And I&rsquo;d like to take a minute just sit right there
I&rsquo;ll tell you how we revolutionized fan-base care
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our minds, this idea was born and raised
On youtube, where we spent most of our days
Watching vids, maxing, relaxing all cool
Drooling over products that we can&rsquo;t pay for with a pool
When a couple of guys, who were tech youtubers
Said something that made us curious-er
He had a closet of old tech, all of which was brand-new
                    <br>
                    And said &ldquo;What to do with tech after I make a review&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought and researched the topic yesterday
And found youtubers had too much tech, with more on the way
Too many raffles and weak fan interaction
So we thought, why not fix both those infractions?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that&rsquo;s the story about how we came up with Youtube Connect
