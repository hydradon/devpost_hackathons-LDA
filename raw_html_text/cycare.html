                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The statistics regarding cyberbullying are astonishing. While nearly 43% of kids have been bullied online and 25% have experienced cyberbullying more than once, only 1 in 10 victims inform a parent or trusted adult of their adult.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chrome extension accesses the user's facebook feed and flags negative comments about the user. These comments are then flagged, with those who posted them being added to a possible block list. After certain numbers of negative posts about the user, they are unfollowed/blocked. The user is also given help via a chatbot link that allows them to get the help they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js, html, and python to create our app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of issues with having so many files that work together. The debugging was particularly  difficult since we didn't always know how to track what went wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create an actual extension that functions and could potentially be useful to someone in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how web extensions work, and how to integrate code from different platforms together.

                    What's next for CyCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is looking to expand CyCare beyond Facebook. We would like to implement the chrome extension on other social media including Instagram and Twitter.
