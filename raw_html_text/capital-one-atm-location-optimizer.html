                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the Capital One Nessie API, we wanted to use the data to help find locations of overused and underused ATMs to optimize the decisions of ATM placements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows current ATM locations as well as a heat map describing customer transaction frequency to give insights for future ATM locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JSON API request to extract the data and inputted it into a Google Maps API to create heat maps and markers for better data visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with artifical API data made the insights on our map harder to find. Should the data for the customer transactions be real, we could find areas of high and low transaction frequency to gain more useful insights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand data visualization using multiple languages and APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Capital One ATM Location Optimizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to use real customer data in order to gain valuable insights on ATM placements. Furthermore, we hope to develop algorithms to find exact optimized locations for the ATM placements.
