                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thought it would be a pretty cool thing to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rules are as follows:
Place customer cards on the field. Each customer has 2 accounts, the first (left number) is the credit card account which shows the defensive stat of the customer if this number reaches 0 the customer is removed from the board. The second account is the savings account this determines how much intrest the customer generated per turn the higher the number the more funding you will receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain special cards will do various things to help you tip things in your favour
Transfer - Transfer the amount shown from an opponets credit card account to your balance
Merchant (food) - Gain 5000 balance
Merchant (tech) - Doubles the credit card account balance of the customers on your side of the board. 
Merchant (bar) - Halves the credit card account balance of the customers on your opponent's of the board. 
Merchant (dealer) - Removes one customer on your opponents side of the field
Merchant (store) - Draw 2 cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have no customers on the board you will lose a certain amount of balance each turn, when either player's balance reaches 0 that player loses and the game ends.
                </p>
