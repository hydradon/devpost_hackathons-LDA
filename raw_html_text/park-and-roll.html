                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thousands of people are stuck in traffic jam every day commuting to Prague, wasting time, polluting the air and making Prague itself a bit less nice place to live. 
Only if they knew they can effectively use a broad network of P+R parking places around Prague, which will make them drive less, save planet and be happier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Park &amp; Roll is a mobile app which helps people decide whether they could save time driving to Prague by using one of available P+R parkings. The app provides real-time data about free parking spots for all available parkings, including estimated times to get there and link for the navigation app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is powered by React-native. The backend is built on top of modern serverless engine, using both nodejs and python for data handling. For directions data, the google maps api is being used. For real-time info about available P+R, golemio public api is being used.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge was limited time in which we had to put together something usable. Fortunately, we were able to achieve

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is currently the only one available, which combines driving and public transport directions. We are happy we could add some extra value to it thanks to live data about P+R parkings Golemio provides.
