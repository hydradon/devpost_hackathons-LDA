                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participating in last year's Hackathon was the first time I asked myself:  How does one make a device communicate with another? Illustrating what that challenge has inspired me to learn is the purpose of the project - (A dedication and thanks to the people who made this event possible)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to remote control a temperature device via a Raspberry Pi which is connected to a phone that may register time-based temperature alterations and is also connected to a pebble smartwatch that also allows both features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I don't have an Air Conditioner with me or the hardware I simulated an Air Conditioner with JavaFX to exemplify the purpose. This connects to a phone application built on Android which also connects to a pebble watchapp built with C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    !!!Several Concurrency issues involving the JavaFX application thread.
Issues regarding windows 10 integration with Github.
Cloudpebble conundrums due to access points and the inability to alter them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The catharthis of "it finally works" is amazing, but I'm proudest of all I've learned along the way (including the hours spent on elusively simple problems).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lessons on Multi-threading with JavaFX.
How to get system time on Android.
How to get location on Android.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Home Temperature Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an Infra Red transmitter on the Pi to remote control an actual air conditioner.
Using a sensor on the Pi to continuously poll home temperature and display this on phone.
Also creating a watch face for the pebble that incorporates the above.
