                    The concept for this program is real time music composition. As you play the keys, the program would learn from your melody and fill out the rest of a looping 12 bar phrase (or any arbitrary length) with accompaniment. It would also display note output on a music staff ticker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also implement a "call and response" feature in which you solo for one or two bars, then the script plays its own melody in response to what you just played. This would be a fun substitute when you don't have another musician to play with. And, as with all simple scripts, it would be fun to see what sorts of tunes the web app would consider to be a good melody.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all playback modes, we would implement a save and export feature, in both .midi files and in printable sheet music .pdf's. Your melody's could play, loop, pause, and resume as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more advanced musicians, this web app would be fun to toy around with to gain new composition ideas. For less advanced musicians, it would helpful for keyboard performance to be able to see their note output transposed in real time. All in all, we think that this is a fun and simple way to create music in a lightweight environment, and on any device.
