                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us were attending our first-ever hackathon and wanted to create something interesting for the purpose of learning. During this, we came across the JetBlue challenge which appealed to us. We were able to use our creativity to come up with a potential solution to their task at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app, Discovr, provides the user with instant deals on flights using data provided by JetBlue. By asking the user their preferred vacation setting and interests, we are able to match them up with flights to locations we feel would most appeal to the user. The application was built mobile-first and is responsive on many devices including desktop computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was programmed by one group member using HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap. It was designed to carousal through a list of destination 'tiles'. Each tile displayed information which corresponded to the data extracted from the Database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back-end development was put together by another group member. They implemented their knowledge of data management to create the appropriate methods to parse sets of data and extract the appropriate information. The back-end essentially searched through the database for destinations which matched the likes of the User and selected flight times which were expected to be the most cost-effective and valuable to the traveller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time constraint was one of the larger problems which we ran into. By the time we figured out exactly what we planned on creating, a lot of valuable time had already passed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        teamwork, collaboration, time-management, critical thinking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DISCOVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wealth of knowledge and experience YHack provided will be brought forward with us in the future and inspire us to further improve DISCOVR and any other projects we choose to do in the future.
