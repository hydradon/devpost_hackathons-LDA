                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a St. Charles based robotics team from St. Charles West High School and we were looking for some extra coding experience and what better way to gain that then by helping the community while doing it? This competition for us is a learning experience and we sure have learned a lot together and we all look forward to competing again next year!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program actively detects problems that can lead to a person becoming homeless, actively preventing the problem that is homelessness. After our program flags a certain person based on certain tells they are notified through text message and the St. Patrick's is notified that this person is going through a traumatic life experience that could send them looking for shelter soon.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After using Tableau 10 to go through the information provided we quickly realized that the info provided would not be useful that much in our program. So to solve that problem we used data crawling to go through the MO judicial database to gain our data that we then sent into our code. For the main code we mostly used bluemix, javascript and node.js. All of these had their own complications but they were solved easily with a little bit of teamwork and perseverance.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first our biggest challenge was data crawling but after that was sorted out everything else went relatively smooth, a few small bumps along the way. But our biggest problem was definitely learning how to data skim.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to data crawl to get reliable data to create our program off of, also we were really proud of a lot of inexperienced coders coming together to make something that could actually prevent homelessness before it even happens. Being able to accomplish this made this weekend a major success.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about each other and what our strengths and weaknesses were but after we figured out how to work around that we really learned how to manage and learned a lot about the correct programs to use when tackling projects like this

                    As you could probably tell from our name, we all come from a robotics team- Chief Robotics from St. Charles West High School, in St. Charles, MO.
