                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the project came from the games Drive Ahead and Fun Run. From a young age we have been fascinated by fun multiplayer games, therefore, we chose to implement one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a race between two characters on each side who have to try to get to the other side. A person wins if they surpass all the obstacles and reach the starting point of the other player.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this code purely in Java and defined a Driver, Panel, Obstacle class, and Player class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The toughest challenge we ran in to was programming the physics for the obstacles. It took us 4 hours to correctly program how the ball could land on the obstacles top but not on the side and bottom. The issue we faced that when the player was jumping, they could phase through the side of the obstacle's wall. However, when the player was just moving front or back, they could not jump on the top of the obstacle. To fix this issue, we had to totally rewrite the method to analyze each case separately.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An important accomplishment we are proud of is programming the physics of the obstacles. It is not as easy as it may seem and took us multiple hours as a team to finish. *
                    <em>
                        Most of all
                    </em>
                    , we are extremely proud of our ability to put out a final product that we had a ton of fun making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of teamwork and communication to reach an end goal. Our project would not have been possible if it weren&rsquo;t for our teamwork and communication to finish the job. For example, while working on our reset method, we exhibited excellent teamwork. We were all together on the same computer tracing the code together to receive the desired output. At that point, that is when we knew that we had gained a valuable skill from HooHacks. HooHacks really made coding fun for us, and we hope to come back next year with an even better product.

                    What's next for Multiplayer DeathRace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to implement the game as an app and add more features such as infinite mode. One of our goals to begin the project was to make moving obstacles, however, insufficient time due to the challenge of the physics of the obstacles prevented us from making moving obstacles. However, we will surely work to make moving obstacles as it will enhance user experience and make the game more challenging.
