                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were challenged to create a product that makes the air travel experience easier for those who don&rsquo;t travel often or at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows the user to create an account that will store all their saved flights and be accessible from any device. Instead of having the hassle of digging through emails or looking through crowded websites for flight information, EZ Flight simply holds all your flight data available in a clear, well-formatted layout that is easy for people of all ages to use. For the flyer who has never flown before due to uncertainty about flight safety, we have dedicated a large portion of our homepage to showing statistics on why flying is much safer than any mode of transportation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and js to design the website, as well as the create the server that would hold the user information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing for communication between the website and our server was initially a challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a service that is accessible from any device that will help to bring those who have never flown before to their first flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS and how it performs with bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EZ Flight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to continue to develop EZ Flight by providing the user with an ICS file of their flight information in order for them to be able to access this crucial information through their favorite calendar application. We would also like to implement a step by step navigation system that alerts the user where to go in the airport as well as when to go.
