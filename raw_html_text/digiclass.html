                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At hour school, we noticed that many students take pictures of homework assignments, teacher notes, etc. but they never check back on them or could do anything with them because they were not able to manipulate the text to help them with their assignments. We wanted to create an app that would be readily used by students in our school, and benefited multiple parties who used the app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app focuses on the student's ability to obtain images containing various portions of text from pictures taken of a lesson. The application converts these pictures to text and uploads it to a commonly shared resource.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create our UI. We then used Python and Bash RC to use tesseract-- an OpenCV application to recognize text from photos and translate it into strings.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the lack of time, compiling a vast amount of coding into our application was very time consuming, which disabled our program from the potential complexity that us creators had in mind for it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully convert image to text and use our UI's.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group has come to understand that in order to conquer a large project such as this, it requires time management and a great deal of time and patience between team members. Our group was able to effectively split work between each other along with supporting one another during times of new challenges. Coding will inevitably lead to potential issues within programs and can invoke frustration from new affairs. However,

                    What's next for DigiClass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creators of DigiClass hope to continue to develop the app to be widely more available through bigger app development programs and create our own servers to keep data on.
