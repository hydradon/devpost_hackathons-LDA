                        1 in 5 children in Hong Kong live in poverty

                        3,600 tons of food waste are disposed of at landfills each day

                </ul>
                <p>
                    To minimize waste and to relieve poverty, we want to provide a grassroots solution that are autonomous and cost effective.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While HK has established charities working as middlemen, there is a lack of low cost solution that matches donors with beneficiaries directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide a just-in-time solution for potential food donors (in particular small restaurants) to flag their overproduction, and enable people in need to apply for free meals from their outlets.  Build in mechanism will also ensure that applicants are prioritised in terms of needs verified (e.g., by Government Agencies) to avoid abuse (e.g., each user can only claim two meals per day)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of ideas will be added and evaluated along the way, but that's basically the framework.
A two sided marked approach to this nonprofit business suggests that a model is deployed over the data that would be able to predict basic needs in certain areas, and may highlight potential shortages to interested parties.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predictions without actual data are impossible, hence we need to entice users to actually join. The incentive for restaurants should be, in cooperation with Government Agencies, to claim seals such as "Caring Company" for their charitable work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we did not want to be in the way of Food Angel and similar initiatives, so we need to ensure that that's not a method of competition. Hence, for now, we do focus on smaller restaurants and their leftover food / ingredients.

                    Filling a gap in existing spectrum of food assistance to the poor.

                    Users want to take proactive actions instead of awaiting for help.

                    Demand and supply for leftover food will be mapped down to street level detail.  With big data analytics, this can facilitate Government and other charitable agencies to proactively plan their food assistance effort.
