                    It's a game where intelligent agents from different species interact with each other and the the external environment. These agents have to pick up food and avoid poisons. When two agents from the same species run into each other, they can reproduce. Some species prey on other species. Overtime, the agents will age, so they are forced to search for food. In addition, a single player can also participate this game by controlling one of the agent.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Each agent is controlled by a deep network trained by q learning algorithm. When they reproduce, the network of offsprings are generated using neuro-evolution algorithms to combine the networks from the parents.

                    The challenges we ran into include the difficulty of balancing the power of each species.
