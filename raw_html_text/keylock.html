                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team I was on at Citrus Hack 2016 worked on a cyber security hack called Tru Pen.  I thought I could do another cyber security hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    KeyLock protects against password cracking and even other people that know your passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python and the curses library.  All the calculations are done with simple math, there is on machine learning (as much as that excites everyone).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picking a library took 2 hours.  I underestimated how long it would take to easily add new users and retrieve old ones from files, and a majority of the code I wrote is for that.  A lot of code is not used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pick a library and design better software to save pain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KeyLock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll finish it and add machine learning one day.
