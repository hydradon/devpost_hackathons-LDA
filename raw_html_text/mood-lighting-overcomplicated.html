                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A idea created by Cy for use in his own life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project produces calming gradients which can be changed at the press of a button, while also providing haptic feedback at the press of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used breadboards, Arduinos, LEDs, and computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many timing issues, and had to adapt when we discovered that our capacitive touch button was faulty. In addition, we ran into quite a few bugs that took a lot of dedication to debug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame the majority of our issues with much patience and persistence, wrote some difficult programs, and applied our previous knowledge to a challenging novel situation.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We each had some of our own knowledge, so we made sure to share it with each other.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Mood Lighting, Overcomplicated
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cy plans on 3D printing an enclosure, moving to an ATTiny, soldering more joints, and more final prototype design changes.
