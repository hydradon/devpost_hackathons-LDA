                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safety of women matters a lot whether at home, outside the home or at a college campus. Some of the most common crimes against women occur on university and schools. We believe that we can help students as well as parents while selecting a university campus of their choice which is safe and secure. Campus Safety responds to the needs of victims experiencing violence on campus by providing them insights into the community aimed at reducing the assaults.
