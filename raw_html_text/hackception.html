                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something fun and learn what we wanted to learn. Our goal is to design and run a complete hackathon before this one ends.

                    It generates hackathons.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and html to make this program. Hosted on Microsoft ;D.
