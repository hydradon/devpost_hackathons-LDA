                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For decades, many young adults haven't been taught the dos and donts of money management. Whether it be establishing a line of credit, taking out loans, receiving a savings bond, or saving money, young adults tend to fall behind or lack basic knowledge of financial stability to meet savings goals, pay bills, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issue isn't only present within young adults but with the underbank as well. Although, the issue could persist at adolescence, research would show it could be due to a number of factors other than the lack of trust with financial institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One factor that stands out is the sales tactic many financial advisers/consultants use today to get potential customers to open new accounts. Through persuasion, the process of opening a new account usually comes with a lot of paperwork and unnecessary documentation that no one will feel like reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to that, advisers forget to mention a simple rule everyone should follow:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't spend money you don't have ton of paperwork and unnecessary
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    During this hackathon, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try out new software, Blender being one of them. Overcoming the learning curve was motivating and fun.
