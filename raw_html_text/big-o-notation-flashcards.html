                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to study for an upcoming CS exam with fellow classmates, but I also wanted to gain some experience by attending my first hackathon (since I am new to the CS world). To do both simultaneously, my project helps prepare myself and my classmates for the exam.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flashcards on Big O notation for various sorting and searching (to help study for a CS exam)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mentor taught me the basics of web development and helped me to implement my project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, and JS are completely new to me, so it took a little time to get used to working with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a basic understanding of web development as a whole (while studying).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How HTML, CSS, and JS work together to form websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Big O Notation Flashcards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may work towards adding pictures and other enhancements to make the studying experience better.
