                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 ordinary objects, a bed and a lamp, working together to create a smoother wake-up experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bed is actually equipped with a system tracking the user's sleep patterns which are shared with the lamp to allow it to wake one up at the most appropriate time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solderered an accelerometer to an Arduino to get live-feedback of the motions of the user lying in the bed, and set up a Python program to analyze the sleep phases and send the results live to a user-friendly dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled at first to connect all 3 layers together. The Arduino had to send live data over to the Python running the analytic program and this one had to send its result to the HTML/JS website thereafter. Our program written in Python took considerably more time since we had to choose how to structure the data to then be analyzed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is very proud over the fact that we managed to dispatch the workload in an efficient way and that the final product is actually functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a product with even a small variety of components can take much more time than is ordinarily available. Also, we realized that the teamwork we had helped us significantly towards having a working prototype by the time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sunrise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the user's experience through the dashboard. More relevance and more predictiveness.
