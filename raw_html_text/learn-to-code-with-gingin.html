                    Inspiration/
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire team were all eager to create something that had the potential to create an impact on someone's life. All coming from a Computer Science background we thought the best way to use our skills would be to share it, specifically with younger kids (Ages 9-12).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea revolves around a game which in order for the user to advance each level, they must choose the correct sequence of commands to make the character, Gin Gin overcome each obstacles. In this version of the game, we hope that the user learns the fundamentals of coding, i.e. statements, conditions, actions, and some game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team decided to build this game in Unity, with GitHub as our VCS. We started out with a intense brainstorming session, followed by sketching, ultimately using a modular design to take on and complete the tasks that came up based on the sketches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge throughout this event would be the steep learning curve for most of the team members in terms of using Unity. However, since they are coders they took this on as a challenge and learned much in the process. Outstanding Issue:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Linking references with prefabs to make the HUD usable for all scenes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smoother camera and player movement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cleaner UI.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>

                    <li>
                        The auto-play of the game based on an optimal solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the end how the UI turned out, specifically MainScreen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Git Management by Bradley Ritten was executed really well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The team had a lot of fun, the ability to get a significant portion of our goals completed given the time frame, and no conflicts within the team.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Learned how to design and create a 2D game in Unity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Work well under stress, pressure, and for someone of us sickness.

                    <li>
                        Modular design is very important and effective in a team environment.
