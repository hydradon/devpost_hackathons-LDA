                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill went through multiple iterations. Initially, it was build with the v1 release of the Alexa developer tools. Honestly, it was pretty hacked together, as I was using AWS and Alexa for the first time. I was excited about the project, so I open-sourced the whole thing. You can find some copy-cat skills based on my template. After I got comfortable with the skill-building process, I rewrote the entire thing using the latest SDKs and what I had learned along the way.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was my introduction to the AWS tools, so I learned lots about how to build and host content on AWS.

                    What's next for Alex Skill - Interview Prep

                <p>
                    I would like to incorporate more interview questions and allow people to participate in more focused prep sessions.
