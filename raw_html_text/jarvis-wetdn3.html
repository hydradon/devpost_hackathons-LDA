                    &ldquo;Success consists of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasm.&rdquo; And while I never define my obstacles as &lsquo;failures,&rsquo; I mark my success by my repeated perseverance through adversity. I have faced several challenges over the years. 
Initially, when I joined college I wanted to be a great engineer but did not have any background in computer science and I didn't know about a single programming language. Then I started investing my time into myself, I started from basics and believed in the fact that learning is the key. Hence, I learnt everything that I could from the online resources and next year I won a coding competition at my university and that boosted my confidence. Later, I decided to pursue my career in machine learning but didn't have any guidance or resources to pursue my interest. Then I contacted all my friends who had similar interests, we collected some money and bought a machine learning course and that's how we ended up finding  solutions to the problems that have serious impact on our daily lives. 
Time management was the most difficult task for me during my initial days, because I worked without planning. But then I figured out my initial goals, prepared a list of them and worked accordingly. At the end of the day, I used to evaluate myself and work upon the mistakes that I did constantly. I wasn't a born leader but I had the passion and determination to be a self-made leader and to  inspire others who face the similar difficulties.
