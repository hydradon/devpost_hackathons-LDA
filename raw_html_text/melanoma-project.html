                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having attended Microsoft's workshop on Azure, I was immediately drawn to the custom vision API and was excited to test it out. I thought of a simple problem that I actually came across a couple of times in Reddit discussions, asking what was a common medical symptom people often overlooked -- moles! Strange growths -- that turn out to be malignant and cancerous! Often, people dismiss these things that seem minor until it's
                    <em>
                        too late
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website allows the user to upload an image of a growth they are concerned about on their skin, and will receive a recommendation on how strongly they should see a doctor, based on the probability of how closely the growth resembles melanoma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft's Custom Vision API; I uploaded several images of "regular moles" and definite instances of melanoma to train it to detect the probability of a growth or mark on skin being showing characteristics of melanoma. High probability is meant to represent the information that the growth is abnormal enough to warrant seeing a doctor to get it checked out.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had extremely basic knowledge of HTML and absolutely

                        zero
                    </em>
                    knowledge of JavaScript and how to call APIs. I didn't even know what an API was before I got to Hack the North.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a straightforward idea that was within reach of my beginner status and being able to execute that idea to produce a product I can demo. Building this website was very much a first for me and being able to see it do the thing I want it to do feels fantastic.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Similarities between Java and JavaScript -- I was able to recall Java knowledge to wing using JavaScript. More importantly, I learned how to call an API using JavaScript.

                    What's next for Melanoma Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding databases of even more pictures in order to train my custom vision to become more accurate and determining the probability melanoma -- and hence, of encouraging a person to go see a doctor for a full body examination! On a larger scale, it would be nice to build this into something that could serve as a reminder or encourager for people to take care of their health. For instance, putting off seeing a dentist can incur very high charges if a person eventually needs a root canal after delaying a cavity check-up for too long.
