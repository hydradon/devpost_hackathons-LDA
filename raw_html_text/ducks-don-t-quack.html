                    This is a social network site where fashion designer from all over the world can share inspiring creations that everyone can make using the easy-to-follow printable sewing patterns (which are available on the site&rsquo;s shop). As well as adapting the pattern to suit their own style, the designer can also share which fabrics and decoration techniques they've used, to inspire and educate others on global trends. On the create page you can design an outfit to be made and delivered to you, while at the same time your order will also be sent to an impoverished family indeed of clothes. This experience makes the act of giving more personal and also encourages people to design their own clothes. The blog will feature global fashion trends, Life style and Travel. The blog will also showcase the top ten creations of the week to be shared with a wider audience... The site is still under construction, with further changes to the business plan.
