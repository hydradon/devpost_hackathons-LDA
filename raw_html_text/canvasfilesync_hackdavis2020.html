                    Synchronising Canvas and Your Google Drive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When using Canvas it often becomes frustrating for the end-user who has to constantly maintain
synchronization between what their instructors are posting and their own file systems. This
leads to missed information, nonsensical errors, and general confusion when students do not
know what version of a particular file they are looking at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wish to change this. Canvas File Sync promises to bridge this gap between instructor and
student by facilitating seamless integration between online coursework and
students' Google drive. In fact, after the initial setup, this once great source of confusion is
reduced to a background task that they never see or have to think about.
