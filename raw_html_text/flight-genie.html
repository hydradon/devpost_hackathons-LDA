                    We wanted to try an api that seemed challenging for us to work. After talking with the Sponsors at the Transat A.T. kiosk, we all believed as a team that we could provide a solution that can use their API very well. We wanted to make a program that would suggest flights based on social network activity.

                <p>
                    This program lets the user connect log into his Instagram account. It will then look at his activity. The program will then suggest flights.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flight Genie runs on a php server with Laravel framework to handle the REST api calls. The front end is built using the milligram framework (similar to Bootstrap) and uses jQuery.

                    <strong>
                        It works
                    </strong>
                    . We were able to extract the data from multiple account and show flights based on the user's interest and interactions. It was really exciting to see everything working together in symbiosis.

                    The milligram framework can be difficult to work with if you do not include the style.css file that they don't provide and never tell you to use. I am talking about

                    We are going to build a traveling empire! Benjamin also talked about voice recognition but I must admit that I did not understand how he was thinking about implementing voice recognition to the app. As of right now it is very late (3:52 AM) and Ben is sleeping. I guess it will remain a mystery.
