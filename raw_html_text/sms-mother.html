                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women lack education and support in child care. Regular medical aid is not easily accessible for rural or geographically dispersed areas. So long that the users have access to any mobile network, they can access our services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users call SMS Mother and undergo a simple diagnostic on the well being of their new born or the stage of their pregnancy. Automated checkup replies are sent and track health in addition to reminders on vaccines for newborns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the twilio API in python to handle incoming and out going calls. Google Translate API sends out calls in both Bengali and Engligh. Node.js and FireBase was used to record and save the data. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for the UI. Google Maps API was used to help display statistics to doctors using our services, such as spikes in certain symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially tried to program in java, however, unforgiving exceptions set us back many hours and the only solution was to switch to python. Furthermore, we had troubles completely conceptualizing the system we would use but eventually stuck with pregnancy and infant topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've successfully created a practical and useful web application and call in system! Most of the team consists of beginner hackers, so we're proud of the hard work and determination poured into this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've gotten familiar with the twilio API and improved on our individual skills and contributions!
