                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that many of our peers and ourselves were especially guilty of procrastinating as a terrible habit, so we developed this app in mind to quantify their time wasted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app tracks each tab on the browser and how much time is each one active, presenting it in a presentable graph on every new tabs and on the popup when clicked on the extension. The tab also shows helpful information, such as the site that you spent the most time on and the total amount of time recorded on your device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we created the extension with various cohesive parts as to make it work for the average browsing experience.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being beginners to front-end development and web developing, there was a lot of difficulty implementing with the new syntax of the various languages and finishing connecting all of the files together

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a chart library to save time and add to the overall aesthetic of the extension presentation.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    It's OK to ask for help on projects, as an extra set of eyes can always make the difference for our project.
