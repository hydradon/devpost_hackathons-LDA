                    As team
                    <strong>
                        Coffee&amp;&amp;Code
                    </strong>
                    , we wanted to come up with something that related to coffee. We looked at what some of the goals for this Codecamp are and decided to build something around that. Our idea is to showcase the diversity in the participants at Codecamp. We came up with the name,
                    <em>
                        Espresso Yourself
                    </em>
                    , by looking up some coffee puns.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that shows data we gathered from participants at the event. It shows a home screen with general information, a page with all team names, and a page for individual teams with their members and various information about the members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Google form that some people filled out with information about their team and their selves. We created a .csv file from this information and used a python program to parse the file and put it into a data base using sqlite. The front end is programmed in html5 and javascript.  We developed a website concept on paper and then worked through the process of replicating it using code.  We used "Materialize" as a guide to support us while we learned to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We posted our Google form in the Slack for people to take the survey, but we didn't have a lot of responses. This doesn't come close to showing the true diversity at the Codecamp. Half our group is coding for the very first time and so everything we wanted to accomplish for our demo had to be learned and then adapted to meet our goals. This took a considerable amount of time. The people with coding knowledge stepped out of their comfort zones and learned new languages, which also took time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html for the first time to create this project. For the back end, we met our goal of parsing a .csv file and creating a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new ways to code as well as using git and other command line prompts. We also learned about each other and our peers at Codecamp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Espresso Yourself
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully more people will reply to the Google form and we can add them to the database. We also have a domain name, espressoyourselfatcodecamp.com, that we would like to host the website on. We are also thinking that this could be continued as the years go on and make a sort of yearbook for the Codecamp.
