                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going through folders to start an application is tedious, and placing all the application on the desktop quickly fills up the screen with too many icons. I wanted to reduce the time used to find these applications and time used to clean up desktop screens, and I wanted to allow people to interact with their computers in a more efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to interact with their computer without having to touch it.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I borrowed a Leap-Motion sensor from MLH and learned how it functioned by reading the documentations. I proceeded to use what I learned to make a java application where certain hand gestures trigger certain events. For example, displaying your palm with fingers pointing upward will open up MSPaint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into was determining whether to use a Listener where a new thread is made just to do the job for detecting and analyzing frames or to use polling. I ended up using polling which allowed me to determine when I needed to read each frame and allowed me to store values resulting from each frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My application is able to open other certain applications with hand gestures. When finished interacting with each application, displaying two hands to the sensor signals it to close the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the API provided by Leap Motion and the concepts behind their technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to expand the range of hand gestures to open up more different applications. I would also like to implement a way for people to write with hand signals (ex: sign language).
