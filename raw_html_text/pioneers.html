                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone in love with the idea of changing the world, I knew anyone who was bold enough to do so needed this app. The hardest part about running a non-profit is getting people to notice your greatness. I wanted to make an app that lets people in your local community know about your achievements as a pioneer.

                    As one of my first projects, I am most proud of being able to parse data as well as display it on my phone. I have never done this before and it was great to see how well it turned out.

                    How to call data from html forms.

                <p>
                    Im looking forward to a location based Pioneers app where it scans the surrounding area for startup businesses, nonprofits, and more. If they all work out to be useful, who knows how much the community will benefit?!
