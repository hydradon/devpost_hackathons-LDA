                    Buddy is your personal assistant that monitors your device's screen-on time so you can better understand your phone usage statistics. These newfound insights will help you to optimize your time and understand your usage patterns. Set a maximum screen-on time goal for yourself and your personal assistant, Buddy, will become happier the less you use your device and become more unhappy as you get close to or exceed the limit you set for yourself.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an android app using the NativeScript framework while coding in JavaScript. Our graphics were created through the use of Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it was our team's first time creating an android app, we went through much trial and error. Learning Google Firebase and the NativeScript framework was a welcomed challenge. We also faced some technical limitations two of our 3 computers were unable to emulate the app. Thus our ability to do testing was limited and as a result slowed our overall progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were strangers when we met and had different backgrounds of experience. The three of us were separately experienced in either front-end, back-end, and UI/UX which made for a very interesting team dynamic. Handling better CSS, using better classes, and utilizing frameworks such as NativeScript were all things we learned from each other (and the internet).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buddy will be venturing on to increase the depth of our phone usage analysis by not only including screen-on time but also usage by app. We also highly value user experience so we are looking into creating more customizable options such as different species of pets, colours of fur, and much more. An IOS app is also being considered as the next step for our product.
