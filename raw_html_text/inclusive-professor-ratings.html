                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a woman at a male-dominated school, I often run into professors with problematic viewpoints which aren't addressed on RateMyProfessor. In addition, RateMyProfessor often doesn't account for disability accommodations. Sometimes, the worst professors for accommodations as well as the most problematic professors will have very high RateMyProfessor rankings because RateMyProfessor only accounts for easiness  and clarity. Some of the most accommodating and inclusive professors will receive mediocre ratings because the subject matter they happen to teach is dry or difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows students to ratee their professors based on quality, accommodation, and inclusivity. In addition, students and professors alike can see "green flags", or positive behaviors professors exemplify. Students can also be on the lookout for "red flags", or signs a professor may be problematic. Professors can potentially use these red flags to see where specifically they need to improve.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build an Angular app as well as a MongoDB backend.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating MongoDB with the application was very difficult, so I ended up mocking the database. However, this will end up being very useful during unit testing of the application.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I ended up learning MongoDB. I am also proud of the team I formed while making this app, and this hackathon was a great experience for what could be potentially the last hackathon of my collegiate career.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about MongoDB and webhooks as well as ng-bootstrap.
