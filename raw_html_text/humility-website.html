                    Inspiration: I was thinking about what I could do with the one-day education in HTML and thought no one else would try to solve a problem through a cheesy website, and so decided to create it!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It informs people about humility while offering very hard games in an effort to humble the person.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I took the small amount of HTML knowledge, and combined it with any knowledge I could find on the internet.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: At first I could not make the website phone compatible, and spent quite a while trying to figure a way to make my pictures shrink when the window shrunk and finally found someone on the web with something that helped me. I also had the same type of problem with the margins, but a fellow sohacker helped me out with a boolean.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I created a Website that actually looks pretty good through one night of work!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned how to use HTML, as well as a start to boolean, and CSS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Humility Website: Probably a lot to do with CSS. I can add way more stuff into this website if I use CSS
