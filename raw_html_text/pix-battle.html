                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with a dumb idea: What if pigs fighting each other could motivates us to be more responsible with our money? A few brainstorming sessions later, the idea took a turn: What if we are the one fighting the pigs instead that would motivate us with our health and grade?

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started building the app from ground up with Node.js and Google Visualization API.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a simple game in which users can upload the screenshots of the number of footsteps per day and their grades, which they will be analyze by Google and give their in-game characters perks; the higher their daily step count or the better their grades are, the better the perks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During development, we ran into a few problems. We intended to use the Google Fit API to pass the daily step count in the first place, but due to difficulties to get the API to work with our app have made us to change direction to the screenshot method. Another problem is that 2 out of 3 members of our team were completely new to web development. However, the team managed to pick up the pace after we got more comfortable with the process after an intense learning process.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Pix Battle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we are glad that we managed to complete the major functions of our app, considered that most of the team do not have any prior experience. There are a lot of features that we wanted to implement to Pix Battle but can't due to time constraint, but we are hoping to do it in the near future.
