                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several years ago I thought about buying a bicycle. But unfortunately, I was afraid of robbing

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a system that helps users to securely leave their bikes. It consists of bicycle locks, a serverless backend to manage them and a mobile app to access them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have Android app written in Java that scans QR code. App understands which lock user would like to use. Alternatively user can select it on map and have a fastest route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then application sends request to Azure Functions. It's used to approve/reject locking/unlocking the lock. If it's approved, this lock is pushed to the "stack".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This "stack" is read by hardware. It selects operation related to specific lock. After performing it deletes record from the stack.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to involve people in cycling more than it is right now. We were inspired by speech of one of the organizers about situation in Brno.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We have some basic firewall: we store some unique value (call it hash) that is known only by device and specific lock. And if hash sent by device is not equal to the hash of lock then lock won't be opened.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are using serverless computation written in C#. It means that we don't huge backend with complicated configuration.

                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to work with Azure Functions, use Here Maps, scan QR codes and how to build something based on servo motor.
