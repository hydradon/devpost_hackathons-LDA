                    Lots of solar projects are being installed, and there is no solution to operate them efficiently. This leads to costly uninformed operations.
                </p>

                    How it works

                <p>
                    In the SunHub marketplace, you will receive the best price bid for your solar project's operational issue. The platform will perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine when it makes sense to send a contractor to a solar project based on severity of the operational issues they are having (underproduction, soiling, inverter downtime, arc faults, etc.) and contractor bid pricing. We also pre-qualify contractors that bid into the SunHub marketplace so you will receive quality service.
