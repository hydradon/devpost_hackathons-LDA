                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking, why is it so hard to figure out what's for dinner today? It's always annoying to have to find the website, download a pdf, then open it up, then search for the text on the page. Instead, it should be neatly put on a website like it was last year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <a href="https://tabula.technology/" rel="nofollow">
                        tabula
                    </a>
                    to turn several PDFs into neatly formatted CSVs, then aggregated all of the CSVs into a single JSON file which was easily parsable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is all a static webpage, and it's hosted on Github pages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we were trying to parse the PDFs directly to JSON. Unfortunately, there are exactly ZERO (0) libraries which make this easy. We used tabula instead which put each PDF into a CSV, then aggregated those into JSON.
                </p>

                    We made a button which skipped to tomorrow. But daylight savings time exists and screwed everything up since "tomorrow" isn't always 24 hours.

                    Daylight Savings Time sucks. Let's follow the EU and just get rid of it.
