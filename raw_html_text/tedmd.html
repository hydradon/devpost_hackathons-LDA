                <p>
                    Write a word processor that uses markdown syntax for the simpler formatting, such as bold and italics

                    RTF word processor that displays the line currently being edited as markdown syntax instead of rich text

                    I sat down on Friday with the idea to create a markdown word processor. After a quick google image search TED had the most minimal GUI so I downloaded the tarball and gutted it to create my own thing. Turns out it's a RTF processor and written entirely in C.

                <p>
                    The write-to-screen trace is not very conducive to modifying how specific text is viewed. Also I still have no idea how the Expose loop knows there's been text input or what it is. As far as I can tell there's no shared data between the loop and the string input event.

                    This was my first brush with gtk. It was also a good experience in attempting to understand an entire codebase all at once, as I originally wanted to start by rewriting the DOM.

                <p>
                    Re-write the write-to-screen path so that spaces are no longer delimiters. Right now its impossible to display multiple bolded words inside one bold block. Also once I've figured out user input, users can type markdown and have the rich text then displayed
