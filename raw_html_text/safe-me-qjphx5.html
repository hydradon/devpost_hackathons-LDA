                <p>
                    Recent happenings of natural disasters around the world has ignited a passion in us to find a way for people who happen to be in the epicentre of catastrophe to report their safety/seek for help.

                        Allows disaster victims to send their location even when their mobile phone does not have network coverage.

                        Helps rescuer better allocate their manpower using information of victim's last seen location

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS app which turns victims devices into relay nodes as in a mesh network. The app propagates the messages through these relay nodes, hoping to reach devices with better network coverage, which is then sent to our servers with the victims' location information and their last seen time stamp. These location information is then plotted on a map to facilitate better management of resources in their rescue mission.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Setting up the mesh network required a lot of trial and error
