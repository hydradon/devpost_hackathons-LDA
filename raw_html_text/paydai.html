                </h2>
                <p>
                    Browser extension for Amazon to enable payments in Dai Stablecoin via Metamask
                </p>
                <h2>
                    WHY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 main motivators:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually, when making a purchase online you have a couple of payment options to chose from - these include wire transfers, credit card payments or third party payment services such as PayPal or Klarna. All of these standard payment options require you to have a bank account and access to a stable monetary system. To get the bank account you need to pass the given KYC requirements, in order to have access to a stable monetary system you need to be born in the right place. One of which is arbitrary - potentially both. Having the option to pay in Dai has the opportunity to solve for both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows crypto payments to transcend into every day interactions.

                <h2>
                    HOW
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an add-on that detects the Amazon payment checkout, is able to read out the basket balance and pre-populates the Dai amount and ethereum address of a Metamask transaction when the user opts for a settlement in Dai. The Dai is sent to the backend address upon which the backend responds with a valid Amazon voucher injecting the corresponding USD amount into the checkout process.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    FUTURE THOUGHTS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this demo we make the assumption that the user holds Dai (+ ETH) and has a Metamask account (and are located in a country where Amazon operates). For now that would limit usage to small number of individuals, &ldquo;CD openers&rdquo;&rdquo;and the Leap DAOs of this world that pay their contributors in Taco and Dai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, usage should be extended to individuals that are currently excluded from traditional financial systems - think small hold farmer in a low income country that tokenizes future harvest income and uses this as collateral in Multi-Collateral Dai.
