                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a CAD developer and eager to learn and explore the 3D development world. I was working on creating a Viewer for 3D model. For that I created a OBJ importer and exporter. On exploring found Collada file format interesting to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collada is an XML based format, which can store 3D model attributes. Used for many interactive 3D applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have researched on this format specifications and tried to make as simple implementation as I can. Currently I have written 3d model and its color attribute. Transformations for component are also considered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge I face while working was, getting color attribute from the fusion application. Standard color attribute are not available directly. The Property which contains the actual color of body is hard to find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have successfully written color attribute to body and also supported proper transformation to exported model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a new 3D model architecture and creating plugin on it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Collada Writer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently Color attribute do not contain transparency attribute and texture. Will look forward for other color attributes and texture.
