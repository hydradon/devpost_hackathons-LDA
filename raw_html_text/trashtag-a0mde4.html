                    $11.5 billion dollars a year is spent on cleaning litter in the U.S. Not only is walking past loads of trash on the street gross, litter on the street can also attract vermin, drain into water systems, and carry germs.
TrashTag is a website that was created by a group of three freshmen at McGill and Northeastern University to facilitate communities of people that wish to help clean our planet. It was inspired by the recently trending hashtag &ldquo;trashtag&rdquo; on Twitter from earlier this year where people worldwide picked up trash around their community. No one wants to live in a planet that is one huge landfill, and Trashtag provides a way for people to combat our growing litter problems, while allowing people to meet and connect with others in the community that share their passion for a clean environment. The website allows users to arrange logistics of trash meetups and provides a feed for users to post pictures. Using tomtom&rsquo;s API, Snapchat&rsquo;s Snapkit, and Google&rsquo;s Cloud Vision API, Trashtag&rsquo;s interface brings together like-minded individuals to help make an impact on the environment in a fun and social way. 
In future updates, we hope to add a score feature where users can accumulate points for each pound of trash they clean up individually or in a group during a meetup. Trashtag will eventually be available as a mobile application, which will allow users to conveniently browse their feed and message other users from wherever they are. We would also like to refine the use of Google Cloud's image recognition software to allow users to quickly upload a picture and get a response telling them if the item is recyclable, compostable or trash. Currently, users can login through a TrashTag account or through SnapChat. We'd also like to implement the Creativity SnapKit to allow users to add filters and stickers to the pictures they post in the feed.
As three freshmen, we started this project with little experience developing web apps and using apis, but we learned a lot a long the way including how to incorporate maps into a website and how to use the Google Cloud platform. We are proud to have incorporated several different apis into our work and code in a language we are not completely familiar with,
