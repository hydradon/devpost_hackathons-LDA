                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build it
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets history data of the last 5 years, on cars which failed the test data. It sorts them by Brand, Model and Region. Using this data we can forecast for an exact model of car what is the chance to fail in a particular region.
