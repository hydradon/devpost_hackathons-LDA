                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life I found out I was very lazy. Actually it didn't take me that long to realize that I was very lazy. But it did take me a long time to realize that I'm a competitive but lazy person. i started to hole myself in the library and eventually just started to study if I saw other people studying. Especially people from the same classes as me, such as  my team mate. So I wanted to make an app that would help inspire people like me to study.

                    study social.&trade; utilizes the tried and true Pomodoro technique to help students focus on tasks but in case you're lacking motivation, we added a feature for users to see what their Facebook friends with the application are working on. Additionally, there is an included to-do list feature that is easily accessible at any time during the Pomodoro cycle.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is written in Swift 3. We used Firebase for our real time database. Lastly we used Facebook's Graph API to retrieve friends of the user.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logging into Facebook using Swift was difficult, being unable to correctly implement the reoccurring timer, destroying our Github master branch to the point of no return, remaking the Github repo because we wanted a non destroyed master branch, and lastly Xcode's inefficiencies that led to our troubles with Github.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add group studying features, such as group chatting, and a synchronized timer so that multiple people can be on the same Pomodoro cycle. We also want to add camera integration so that other friends, or your boss, can request to see your progress on your tasks. Another thing we want to add is a use for the Tomatoes that you get for completing cycles to make them more compelling for our users to earn.
