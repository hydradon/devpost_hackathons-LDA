                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creative custom pixel shaders seen in videogames and other media
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to create custom shaders and modify its' values on the fly in real time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ with OpenGL and the Oculus SDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the VR headset as well as a functional user interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have several working proofs of concept that integrate all we wished to accomplish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting images to appear on a virtual reality headset is not as easy as the documentation would lead you to believe.
