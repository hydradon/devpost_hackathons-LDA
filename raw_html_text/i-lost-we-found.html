                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with create-react-native-app and React. We assign different components to each of us, and we bring them together.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No seats nor table, slow wifi at first, no wifi all day, and ran into technical issues like syntax errors and installation issue(setting up the project).
                </p>
