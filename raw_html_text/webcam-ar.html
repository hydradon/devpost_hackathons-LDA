                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the webcam lab assignment for CS10, and wanted to make something using the webcam in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webcam AR is an augmented reality application that tracks an object of a specific color and projects an animated 3D model onto a webcam video based on the object's location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and C# to build this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to figure out how to track objects of a specific color, as the low web cam quality results in continuous fluctuations in color readings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I managed to implement a simple AR mechanism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to manipulate web cam data in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Webcam AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There aren't many augmented reality games out there, so I think this is a good proof of concept for what Unity could do in the AR field. Future directions for Webcam AR could include adding more models and the ability to change what color object is tracked through UI, as well as creating a game around it.
