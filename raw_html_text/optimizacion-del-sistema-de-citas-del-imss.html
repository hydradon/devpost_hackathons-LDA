                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were married with the idea of working with Smart Cities, but after having our breakfast (tacos) we thought about the idea of working with the IMSS, because the taco place was next to an IMSS clinic. We have heard about many stories of how people wait for hours to see a doctor in these clinics, and the reason is because the system is old, not digital. We thought on working with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We work with a data base of documents with all the clinic information of the patients, and the idea is to be able to reach all the information needed for the thing that the patient wants, like making an appointment with the doctor, which with the actual system takes hours or even days. To digitilize the paperwork and having the origginal copies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created interfaces that are really friendly with the end-user, wheter it is a worker of the clinic or with a patient. After compiling enough information about the IMSS and the old system, we developed the interfaces with wordpress. We tried to make an actual program with objects in Java, but our knowledge wasnt enough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of knowledge mostly, as data base is a topic that we will see in others semesters, it was almost imposible to learn and develop a data base in 20 hours. We were extreamly frustrated, so we decided to change our focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The compiling of information, that we literaly went to an IMSS clinic to ask about how everything work there. The idea is great in our opinion, it could literally help the whole nation in the health department.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that it doesnt matter if we are not smart enough, we can steel work with a great idea, to find a way to help others with the things we know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Optimizaci&oacute;n del Sistema de citas del IMSS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to see it working, but the main problem is that even when we considered the informatic security, it is a part that we couldnt learn much in so little time, it is extremly complicated. So the next step would be, working with the security issues. If that is done, this could work in the whole nation, without the shadow of a doubt.
