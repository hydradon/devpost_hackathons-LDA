                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Three different ways to insert an event:
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Use "i", as mentioned aboved.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Use "map". For example, "map go to gym tomorrow 14:00"
will create the event "go to gym" and map it to tomorrow
14:00
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Use natural language. For example, "I will go to gym tomorrow
at 14:00" will do the same thing as above.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Use natural language to get the list of event
                </h2>
                <p>
                    for example, "What is my plan today" will be equavalent to "l"

                    Features to mention
                </h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This program automatically deletes events that has past
its date, because I want to convey the idea of looking
forward instead of looking back.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you don't want to calculate the actual date of an event,
don't worry! You can use words such as "today", "tomorrow",
"Tuesday", etc. to insert events.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Don't want to mess the schedule up? Afraid of getting conflict
schedule? No worry! If there is another event around the event
you are going to insert, the program will throw a warning message.
If you insist to insert that event, type "yes". Of course, if you
want to be fancy, typing "hell yeah" will also do the work...
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Will you do something at 2 am or 3 am? Well... probably not. So, when
you use the map function and type "map go to Mike's house tomorrow 2:30",
it will automatically be interpreted as 14:30 in the afternoon. What if
you do want to do something at 2:30 am? Simplly adding a "0" will solve
the problem. In other words, "map go to Mike's house tomorrow 02:30".
