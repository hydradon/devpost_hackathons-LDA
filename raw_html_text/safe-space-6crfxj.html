                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that was like a peace atmosphere that changes into a horror basic game with the objective to escape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we currently has the environment built and is able to recognize your hands with the equipment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the environment inside of the Unity Engine and downloaded the software inorder to allow the controls for the Oculus and Leap to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving the character...which stop our progress on the entire game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we got a environment built and basic camera movement to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a person be able to move is almost impossible to do unless we create our own scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safe Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe we will mess with the system later on but we don't own any of the equipment so that will be hard to do.
