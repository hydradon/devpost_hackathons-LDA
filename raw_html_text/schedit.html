                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you're sick in bed, the last thing you want to do is call in, talk to someone, and schedule an appointment.  It's tedious!  Not to mention, scheduling sites are inconvenient and lack accessibility.  Why not make it as easy as saying, "Hey, Google"?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Sched 'It" is a tool for the Google Assistant that makes booking an appointment with your choice of doctor simple.  With "Sched 'It," you are able to search for specialists in your area and book appointments based on your time and needs.  "Sched 'It" lets you find the closest available appointments, using your calendar to keep you up-to-date on your next check-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used "Actions on Google," "Dialogflow," "Firebase," and the intent to use "Google Calendar" for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we managed to follow through with the main idea of our project and were very successful as a result, we still encountered several issues along the way, but we surpassed them as best we could.  We had some trouble with Google Calendar integration and synchronization with current calendar data, finding the best medical appointment API website we could use that was similar to Zocdoc, as well as registering for a new domain for testing (which we decided not to do).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of minimizing the necessary time needed to make medical appointments in the most-efficient way for people, and receiving the necessary criteria for patients' data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned better methods for debugging and how to be patient if a piece of our code didn't work right away.  We also gained some familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next For Sched 'It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Sched &lsquo;It&rdquo; will improve the overall experience of any person needing to make medical appointments, and also make it easier for our generation.  More
importantly, this will add efficiency to scheduling.  In turn, this will save the hospitals money, scale-down anxiety, and everyone will have a better understanding of the scheduling system, as a result.
