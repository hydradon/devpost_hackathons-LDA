                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plight is inspired by the iOS game Plague, where the sole goal of the player is to spread contagious diseases around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is built with the real world in mind, adding a social aspect as well as more features, including the ability to create healing zones to earn more points. Once the user signs up, he/she is automatically assigned a certain disease as well as an immunity to one. Throughout the game, the user spreads the disease by locating other players who don't have immunity to that disease and passing it on by getting close to them (in terms of location). Once the user is close enough, the target has exactly 15 seconds to use the shield appropriate number of times (depending on the disease). Once the user earns 50 points or more, he/she can go into building a healing zone where other infected people can get healed for the diseases they have. In the process, the one who gets healed loses 5 points which the user picks up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sign Up &amp; Login was built using FireBase 
The map that shows the vulnerable was built using MKMapKit (iOS framework) 
Building hospitals was built using ARKit 
The shield is basically a button that has to be pressed a certain amount of time to not get the disease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it so the phone vibrates or the app runs on the background so the user is notified even when he is not playing the game, but that wasn't possible due to Apple limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the ARKit, MapKit, Location services as well as UI Design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue this project and make a more viable game out of it.
