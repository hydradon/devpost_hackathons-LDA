                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Ink and other several other party games as well as the classic game of rock-paper-scissors. We set out to make a more fun and engaging version of RPS!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an engaging party game that allows the audience the influence certain aspects of the gameplay by texting certain commands which are collected using the Twilio API and the results are sent to the game.
There is also a complementary website that goes with the game which acts as a manual with an included sprite maker (not fully developed due to time restrictions).
