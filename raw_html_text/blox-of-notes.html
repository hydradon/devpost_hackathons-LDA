                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was born from a real life problem. Our college team needed a box, where anyone could submit their short notes containing suggestions, complaints, ideas etc. Every week a so we would open the box and go through the notes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were some
                    <strong>
                        requirements
                    </strong>
                    :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        all notes should be anonymous
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        nobody would be able to access the contents of the box before its opening date
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the box should not be managed by any of the team members (even though we trusted each other)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blox of Notes is built using the
                    <code>
                        Ethereum
                    </code>
                    network with smart contracts written in
                    <code>
                        Solidity
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us had 0 experience with
                    <code>
                        Ethereum
                    </code>
                    coming in this Hackathon, so it was quite challenging going through outdated articles and GitHub issues, figuring out something we've never worked with before.
                </p>

                    Lots and lots of things about blockchain, contracts, keys, privacy and more...

                <p>
                    There are a couple of features to be implemented in Blox of Notes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make all notes encrypted (decript when the box is opened)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More settings when creating the box: number of notes per user, optional anonymity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow to submit more content (other than text)
                    </li>
                </ol>
