                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So you've picked all of your courses for next quarter. You've found the perfect schedule except for one problem: exactly how far away are your classes? PolyTripper shows you the distance between all of your classes as well as the shortest route between them. Made for Slo Hacks Go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds all of your classes and plots the shortest path between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built upon an existing Cal Poly map program and added enhancements as necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team did not have experience with the MapBox API, so we had to learn that in a few hours. Items still cannot be removed from the itinerary. Also, our team decided on this project with about 1/3 of the hackathon left, which caused a lot of undue distress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decide on your hackathon project as early as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PolyTripper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to release this to the public sometime soon.
