                    Getting and collecting actionable data from users and giving them a timely response is the for leader in why Progress builds tools for the web.  With Sitefinity we can give Marketing users the ability to build forms to collect information from users.  With Corticon business users can design complex rules and expose them to software platforms.  With Kendo easy web components are created by dev teams.

                <p>
                    This integration will utilize the corticon API to get business rules results about the data that is submitted in a form and either change form inputs or build out custom results..  Custom results would utilize Kendo so content can be easily produces in PDF or other formats.

                    There are probably infinite use case possibilities here so getting a good focus of what the end results should be will be hard.
