                    When refugees go to a new city, most of them know nothing about the city. Thus, they might get lost, but they need food, health, or shelter for themselves or family members. For this group of people, they need the easiest way get help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution is highly accessible. The system can generate a batch of posters that include a barcode and the instruction of how to use this code. Then, codes can be bonded to a location where they are pasted or mounted, like bus stops, convenience stores, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the refugees see any of this poster, they can contact our system by SMS or scanning with our mobile client. Next, our system will automatically distribute those requests to the volunteers or non-profit organizations by matching the location and service type.
