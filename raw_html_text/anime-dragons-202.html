                    Inspiration- My teammates really wanted to be able to do a game so we made it happen.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works- For our game, you move the man with the arrow keys. To win the game you must avoid obstacles and get to the end.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- The game deleted itself twice and that was really hard to come back from.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- We were able to make extremely hard levels but all of them are beatable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- I learned that it is so much fun making a game. Also that it can be very frustrating at times
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anime Dragons 202- Maybe a second level.
