                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With an ageing population in many countries, there is a need for care for elderly, especially those who live alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project has a heart monitor, which sends a message to the watch if the heartrate drops . In the future Watch will be onnected to an Android App. Second module connected to the Watch is the Kitchen Module. It sends info to the watch, when the water is boiling and let's user remotely turn off the kithcen equipment. Watch, Kitchen Module and Heartrate sensor are in one network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second part of the project is an Emergency Button. After pressing it it will send an emergency message to the officials using an app on our Android Device.
