                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe most of us have been in a situation where we had to read the same lengthy report-webpage all over again when we visited it again, in order to find the relevant information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by this problem, we decided to create a web-browser extension for making notes directly onto webpages -
                    <strong>
                        PageMark
                    </strong>
                    ! The application allows its users to highlight relevant text and make notes, which will be later displayed when the user visits the webpage again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have decided to build the extension for one of the most commonly used web browsers -
                    <em>
                        Google Chrome
                    </em>
                    . Chrome extensions can be built using
                    <em>
                        JavaScript
                    </em>
                    , and all of the popular web frameworks and libraries. The application employs the Google cloud storage for extensions in order to share the notes among the users' Chrome devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was the first web-browser extension we have ever developed - everything was a challenge! The Chrome sandboxes background, popup, and any other environments separately, therefore we had to employ message passing to communicate between the sandboxes. In addition, every sandbox has different permissions, so we had to lots of message passing to overcome some of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we are proud that we made it work! The extension allows us to make notes, reset them, shares them between chrome devices.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt a lot about how the Chrome environment works, learnt about its features and limitations. And also, developed our
                    <em>
                        JavaScript
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        jQuery
