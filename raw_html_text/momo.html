                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We miss tomigochis and wish they could text when they were about to die so we could have saved them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Momo is a virtual pet that needs your care! He lets you know when he needs to be fed or played with, and if you ignore him, he dies :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to run the game and build momo. We also used the twilio API to make Momo call you.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making Momo be able to have his mouth open when you try to feed him
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual pets are nice companions for people who are lonely
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Momo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want momo to be able to call you!
