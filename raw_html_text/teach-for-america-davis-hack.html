                <h2>
                    Inspiration: This Project was done for the none-profit Teach For America. We were asked to hack the method of creating seating roster. With the youth, especially individuals in High School, kids can be very talkative to each other as well as students that fight. Another issue that can occur is that individuals with disabilities sometimes do not get assigned seat to meet there needs. The idea of this project was to create a simple web application where a teacher can enter in information about their students and the application will create the roster for them. I decided to go for a web design app over a software tool to allow for mass free distribution, especially to low income teacher. All an individual needs is a basic connection to the internet and a device that connects to the internet. Linked bellow is a very simple version that I was able to code up in the time I had at HackDavis.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This application will first prompt the individual for the number of rows and columns in there room to get a seat count. Once that is completes it will ask for the number of students. New prompts will show up asking questions about the students. For this initial application we have two simple questions. Does the individual have disabilities and does an individual dislike another individual. The applications is designed to separate individuals that dislike each other and assign front row priority to handicapped individuals.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I started this code form scratch and focused on developing the algorithm and animations through java-script. The code is broken up into three parts. Input initially on the amount of seats in the room and the amount of students. Then it will prompt the user to input information about each student. Finally, the application will process and give out a roster. I was able to add some very basic visual graphic to make the web application look more presentable, but there is a lot of work that can be done to improve.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: The main challenges I ran into was approaching the javascript through the Document Object Model. This allows for a more powerful application but requires a higher level of programming. The Document Object Model focuses a lot on dynamic allocation in javascript allowing for one to scale the webpage very easily.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: This is my first hackathon where I have developed something by myself from the scratch up. I did not have a partner so there were challenges and not having an individual to bounce ideas off of was difficult, but I also learned how to critically approach a problem.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned that there is a lot more to web application development than i though. You have to consider a lot of scenarios and make it possible for all individuals to access the webpage in a equal manner.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms: If possible I would like to expand this into a full application, improving on the javascript code and creating a modern web design. I would also like to add more feature and also create a stronger algorithm adding more methods of separation.
