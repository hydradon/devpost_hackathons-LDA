                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quantum Computers could prove a threat to modern encryption standards. Thus I was inspired to try and create a brand new encryption method!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GDEA securely encrypts your data. It is a symmetric-type cryptographic algorithm that relies on RSA to secure its' keys (like most symmetric algorithms).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python and some math to create an application that uses GDEA to encrypt files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges. Working with very large and very small numbers is tricky business. As a matter of fact, a lot of GDEA is still left to be coded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted an experiment where I encrypted various file sizes with both AES and GDEA, and while AES beat GDEA at low file sizes, the opposite happened at large file sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained a lot of experience working with python, and I learned a lot about cryptography and how it really works. JamHacks was super fun this year and I'll surely be coming next year!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GDEA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned earlier, I never coded in a lot of stuff due to time constraints. I had to outright disable a feature due to some last minute issues. With some more work, GDEA could become faster, more efficient, and more secure.
