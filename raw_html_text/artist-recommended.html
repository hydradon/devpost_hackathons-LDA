                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can never find out what artists like or recommend. Sales are commonly driven by endorsements yet each individual brand is still largely responsible for disseminating that information to fans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows artists to curate their own social profile and monetize their endorsements in a centralized location. With integration to brands via referral links and API integrations, the vision is for artists to directly get kickbacks from brands without any middle men. Fans will be able to find a consolidated place to buy products they need across a variety of categories with a seamless e-commerce experience.
