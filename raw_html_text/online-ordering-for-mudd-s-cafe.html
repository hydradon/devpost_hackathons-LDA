                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've often become late for class due to waiting at the Cafe for an early breakfast before our 8ams. We thought it would be easier for the Cafe to prepare things in advance, during classes, so that they can handle the rush between or before classes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it shows some of the items that the Cafe offers and acts like a form that you can submit, but this needs to be fleshed out as it's mostly front-end development.
