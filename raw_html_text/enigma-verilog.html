                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The enigma machine probably the world's most famous encryption device, and we wanted to learn how it works and if we could possibly create one using digital logic rather than mechanical pieces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the test bench you feed the enigma machine one letter at a time and it will encrypt the letters based on rotor position and rotations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program in verilog and constructed the layout one piece at a time (testbench, rotor 1, reflection rotor, etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Verilog is a very different programming environment from which we are used to and it took some time to learn the ins and outs of how to represent what we are doing and get our desired results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we got something running and can see the path to our end goal and know how to get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about programming in Verilog, digital logic circuits, and about combinational and sequential logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Enigma Verilog
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish the program and add the remaining features of a fully fledged enigma machine (such as a plugboard, interchangeable rotors, and fully functional counting rotors for all of the rotors) and see if we can either make a GUI that interacts with our Verilog code, or if we can construct the circuits and make a physical digital enigma machine.
