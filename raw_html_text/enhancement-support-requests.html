                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ESR is split into two separate applications:
                    <strong>
                        Enhancement and Support Request
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Enhancement and Support Request Client
                    </strong>
                    . Both share some objects between them but each has their own site, their own data store and their own set of interfaces, expression rules, constants and process models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this model, we can scale the number of clients to attend indefinitely and minimize the size of the application to be deployed on their environments as well as limit their access to objects and information they exclusively need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges that we faced was finding an efficient way to send attachment documents from one environment to another. This was not possible using integration objects and Web APIs, so we used messaging capabilities to send documents as email attachments and receive them in a process model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building a bi-directional integration with the Jira platform considering the learning curve of the Atlassian API was a bit of a challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the attractive and easy-to-use UX that was built showing that Appian is as powerful in the front end as in the back end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of our application leveraging process model messaging to communicate two (or more) separate Appian environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, being able to leverage the OOTB Google Cloud Natural Language Connected System in order to analyze text and suggest coincidences was definitely an accomplishment worth mentioning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Enhancement &amp; Support Request
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to keep improving the functionality that ESR has to offer. For example, we will be adding management for SLAs per project functionality in the near future so administrators can have a more specific insight into the reports.
We are also planning on further exploring the perks that AI has to offer. We would like to apply AI on the client side to help clients solve their issues even before they submit a request.
