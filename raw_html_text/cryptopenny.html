                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bitcoins meteoric rise drove me towards cryptocurrencies, so I decided to make a project involving them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays cryptocurrency price information in real time, and mines Monero in the background using the client's CPU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I grabbed live price data from a cryptocurrency api, and used the javascript library for coin-hive to set up the Monero Mine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to make multiple ajax requests in sequence in a synchronous fashion was particularly difficult obstacle I had to get around when building this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm pretty proud of the functionality.  The design is pretty simple but it does the job well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main takeaway from this project was definitely a better understanding of ajax as a whole, asynchronous vs synchronous, and how data is passed on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CryptoPenny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Monero obtained from mining to return to client, donate to charity.
Mine for other cryptocurrencies.
