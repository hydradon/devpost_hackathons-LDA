                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've tried many different podcast players on the linux desktop, but all of them either:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Are webapps, which I don't like because I prefer native apps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't keep track of where I stopped when I was listening to the podcast last.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't fit with my desktop theme.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YAPP is a terminal-based podcast player made to solve these issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YAPP is built in C++ and cmake, with mpv as a backend for audio and git as version control. It's built around parsing podcast XML files and downloading + playing the episodes within.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm all alone, so keeping up with the time restraint was hard, especially in a language like C++. Stuff that might be simple in a language like python, such as writing a GUI or playing audio, ended up taking hours in C++. If I had someone else helping me create the GUI, there may have been one ready by the end of Technica! Unfortunately, right now, there's just a temporary text interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Object Persistence was something I didn't even have a chance to touch, which means YAPP is really a one-and-done application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitting the mpv backend into YAPP was TIGHT. Just barely worked, and heck, I still barely have any idea what I coded. Also, my backend work on parsing XML and getting episodes is really clean! Love that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tip: Don't use a C++ for project with a time-constraint when you don't have any teammates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mean, I still had a lot of fun! I love coding in C++. But jeeeeeeze. At the very least, I should've aimed for something a bit smaller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YAPP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First things first, get mpv to seek the spot I was last playing the podcast at. From there, get object persistence working. Finally, a proper GUI! And by proper, I mean using ncurses, but, you know. Better than "input a number."
                </p>
