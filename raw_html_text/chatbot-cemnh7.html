                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A easy way to be informed of what is going on in the community.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask the city of Stamford what is going on, how to get to a place and express concerns.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far everything is made in Javascript and Node. We use the Facebook chatbot as our front end and use heroku as our back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a broad area when dealing with every concerns. So to narrow out or focus on one area where exempt a group of people who have specific needs. So we need to figure out what algorithm or api that can branch to all the concerns for the people of stamford.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that we come up with a practical idea over night and it can actually be reality as we work on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that choosing a specific api can be flexible as long it is easy for the user to use the end product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are planning to come together and try to make this idea reality for the city of stamford.
