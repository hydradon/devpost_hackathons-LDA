                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Travelling from Surat to Vadodara today for the hackathon, I had to wait at the station for approx 2 hrs...A travel buddy would have made it much more fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon registration in any application like bookmyshow.com etc, we save your travel details and location and connect you to the person who is going to the same event as yours.. This way, you can connect with like minded people if you are travelling alone or just bored :P
                </p>
                <p>
                    When
                </p>
                <p>
                    whenever travelling to a certain event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    bookmyshow api was not available, and the api they use cost 50 dollors a month approx. 
SO, I had to make a JUGAAD way of registering events myself and then connect it and show user who all is going via the route.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The very idea can be integrated to any top event provider application as this makes a social network . In a world where the entire social network is on the internet, it is a great way to meet people and give any app a competitive edge over other rivals
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parse technology was explored along with Navigation Fragment.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously to somehow integrate with an api, so that it works real time. maybe can be integrated with their application as well
