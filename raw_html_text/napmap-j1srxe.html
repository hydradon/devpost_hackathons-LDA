                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Valerie Chiou and Emily Huang love to nap. To the point where they need several naps during the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if they were ever to be on a trip that required at least 12 hours, you bet those two would need a nap some time during the trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's what happened with Valerie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Valerie was with her boyfriend in LA, and Valerie was hit with exhaustion and needed a place to sleep. The car was definitely not an ideal sleeping spot and wanted to be able to sleep in a comfortable bed with pillows and privacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is when she thought of this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches nearby open areas available for people like Valerie and Emily to take a nap in the middle of the day. You can see the user and check to make sure that they aren't dangerous. You can also book the place and negotiate prices all in the comfort of your phone.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used XCode to build the IOS application and also HTML/CSS to build the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emily had no experience in using XCode or even making an IOS application, while Valerie had trouble making the website all from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emily is proud of being able to make an application within the time without having any previous knowledge. Valerie is proud of being able to make a functioning website.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How XCode works.

                    Finish the applications and be able to pitch this idea with a working model.
