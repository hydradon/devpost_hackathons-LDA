                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the recent election, and while the election is over, we hope to educate our users by giving them a variety of viewpoints and biases thereby allowing them to see all sides more clearly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used machine learning to perform sentiment analysis on political websites. Searching the database is assisted by AWS lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website on top of AWS, using natural language toolkit, multiprocessing, and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the intricacies of AWS, and learning new languaes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to utilize AWS lambda, analyze 10,000 webpages, and our sentiment analysis is 80% accurate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had little to no experience with the languages and technology we used for this project! This was such an amazing learning opportunity! Our team members were able to get their feet wet with flask, AWS, python, and html/css!
                </p>

                    What's next for slantsearch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to launch the website, and advertise based on political leaning.
