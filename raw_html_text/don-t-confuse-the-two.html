                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After school, my friends and I would always play basketball at the court right next to our school. However, we would always be forced to go home with dry mouths, as the water fountain at the court would never work. So when we attended this hackathon, we decided that we wanted to make an app and website that would help everyone, not just students, to find water, and also a free public bathroom to go to after drinking the water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After detecting the location of the user, our program accesses our database of public water fountains and bathrooms. It then overlays the locations of the water fountains and bathrooms on the google sheets, along with the reviews from our users through crowdsourcing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a google sheet with all the information used in our program, we then connected it to our application and website. We also allowed our programs to detect our users locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the difficulty to find the location of the device and then input a pinpoint into google maps with our location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of being able to develop an application that works on different platforms, allowing our users who don't have the app to also be able to use the amazing features of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an app for mobile devices implementing google maps with little experience prior to this

                    What's next for Don't Confuse the Two
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to publish this app on the app store and google play store, and add more locations to our database. We also plan to implement a crowdsourcing function with reviews and photos
