                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much perfectly good food goes to waste from restaurants throwing out their food at the end of the day. People would like discounted food and food banks would like food donations. FoodRanger solves this problem by creating a platform where the three can interact and food can change hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows restaurants to post their leftover food, and people can deliver it to food banks with a discounted meal as an incentive
