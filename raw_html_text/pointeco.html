                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought, we should raise awareness about the ecological problems. How do we motivate people for that?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a spice of passion, motivation, and loads of coffee and snacks. We designed the project as a team, attacked the problem statement with the divide and conquer technique. Started off with architecture design, tech stack decision and coded the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
