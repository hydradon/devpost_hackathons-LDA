                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to bring the concepts of the virtual world into a physical interface that people can interact with. We decided to create a physical, digital pet akin to the tamagotchi craze of the 90s.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This inspiration resulted in a wireless robotic pet, named Goddard. Goddard expresses their personality through lights and motion. The user interacts with Goddard through a web interface. However, Goddard can be rebellious and may or may not do what you ask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goddard's body is made from a plastic base, RGB LEDs, and an Arduino Mega. Goddard can interact with friends through their web interface. That interface is made in Python with Flask. Interactions are sent to Goddard over a wireless radio, where they can respond and react accordingly.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goddard had some trouble communicating at first. There was some issues finding the right wireless radios and proper brains for our robot pal.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of time was spent teaching ourselves the right tools and frameworks to get Goddard online, this process was a huge learning experience. Our team members each learned new frameworks, tools, and languages. It's been a long 24 hours, but we've ended up with a wonderful virtual and physical pal who is quite expressive.
