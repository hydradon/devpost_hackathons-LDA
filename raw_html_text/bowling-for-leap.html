                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Late last night I started using the Unity engine, and was tinkering around with spheres and shapes. My friend and teammate Ben suggested we do some sort of bowling app. I was immediately inspired to use the leap motion control to create a bowling game.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a bowling game. Simple and sweet. You can pick up the ball with your hand using leap motion control, and then throw it at the pins downrange. The game tracks how many pins you have struck and what round you are on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Leap motion api for Unity, the building process was fairly smooth. It was my first time using Unity or C#, so after the initial process of learning the basics, I began to construct objects with physics characteristics in Unity and writing scripts using C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the hand actually pick up the ball was very challenging initially. To fully grasp how leap was processing the motion data, and then to use it for the games use was tricky to learn and manipulate.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did this all in one day! I find that crazy. This was my first Hackathon and I was not expecting to accomplish much, but to produce a fully functioning game is very special for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of Unity, and the core concepts of C#, both of which will be incredibly valuable in the future. I also used blender to render the 3d images of the pins, which is something I've never done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bowling for Leap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably not a whole lot! I will try and polish it more and more, but I have my eyes set on bigger and more ambitious Unity projects
