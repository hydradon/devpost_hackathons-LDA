                    Over the past few summers, Drew needed to do multi-threading in JavaScript and found out that there were no libraries which easily and intuitively created threads for running pieces of code. In order to solve this problem, we decide to make a Node.JS addon that utilizes C++ fork() functions in order to multi-thread JavaScript code. The end result is a Thread function, wrapped around the Promise library, that returns a Promise so all of the synchronicity overhead is mitigated.
