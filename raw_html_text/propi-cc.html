                    In today's media-centric world, nothing speaks louder about a person than their online appearance: their profile picture. From social communities like Facebook and Instagram to professional circles like LinkedIn, users place great importance, pride, and judgement on the quality of their profile picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though we all enjoy the impressive profile pictures of professional photographers and designers, not all of us are lucky enough to be so talented! Fortunately,

                    is here to help: by learning from selected sets of great profile pictures, propi.cc can help transform our ordinary, unedited photos into extraordinary online avatars.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is hosted on
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud Compute Engine
                    </strong>
                    , where the website was brought together, including a neat front-end. The back-end consists of two major components:
                </p>
                <p>
                    NEURAL NETWORK: We constructed a training dataset by collecting profile pictures from
                    <strong>
                        Facebook's Graph API
                    </strong>
                    . Using our own aesthetic judgements, we classified these as either "good" or "bad," with heavy emphasis on proper framing. Next, we trained a
                    <strong>
                        convolutional neural network
                    </strong>
                    constructed in
                    <strong>
                        TensorFlow
                    </strong>
                    in two stages: 1) profile pictures vs. background photos without people (for coarse training) and 2) good profile pictures vs poor ones (for fine tuning). In the end, this neural network is able to satisfactory generate ratings for profile picture candidates based on how "aesthetic" they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CLOUD VISION: Simultaneously, the back-end was constructed to make
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud Vision
                    </strong>
                    API calls. These identified the presence of faces. The face bounds of each face were taken from the image annotations and cropped to present the user with  and allowed for user interaction before passing to the neural network.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting
                    <strong>
                        sufficient data
                    </strong>
                    for the neural network was a challenge: through Facebook's API, we were able to collect a little more than 200 profile pictures, which we had to manually label. This took quite some time. Configuring the neural network was intriguing and difficult as well, as it involved a significant amount of tweaking (layer sizes, stride size, pool size, etc.) in order to achieve effective results as well stay within resource limits (our computers kept crashing!!)

                    </strong>
                    was also very impressive. The neural network was built with an illustrative accompanying
                    <strong>
                        visualization
                    </strong>
                    , which could very well have been an interesting project in its own right. The project also made use of
                    <strong>
                        real-world data

                    products is similarly astounding. The machine learning APIs in particular provide an accessible and ready-to-use solution for novices to machine learning. The power that Google Cloud products provide, including but not limited to the ML APIs, pushes the limits of what hackers such as us are capable of.

                    The aspect of getting computer assistance in complicated design decisions opens many appealing avenues for application. For one, the algorithm that comprises propi.cc could very well become ubiquitous on social media sites as a way to give the user a default "suggested" crop/edit when they add a profile picture. This algorithm can be improved with more training data, including more fine-grained classification of different types and aesthetics in profile pictures.

                    But in the further future, similar machine learning algorithms may even help designers creatively invent new logos, layout publications, make art, document life through photography, and so much more. In this project, we've explored how even a mere 36-hour hack can reveal the incredible helpful potential of machine learning.
