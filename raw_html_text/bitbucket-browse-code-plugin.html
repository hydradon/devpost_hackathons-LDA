                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bitbucket is a great SCM tool, but browsing the source to a specific commit was a little bit hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This plugin is a fork and rework of the former "Stash Browse Code Plugin". It was updated to enable
it with the later 4.+ versions of Bitbucket Server (Stash is now Bitbucket Server). This plugin adds a
"Browse Code" Link which navigates the user to a view of the repository at a certain point in
time - specifically the status of the repo from the selected commit's point of view.
In other words: This is some kind of a time machine cause its reverting back to a different point in time
of what the repo looked like at the time of that commit. Simple solution but very helpful and effective in programmers
daily work.

                    Version 1.0.0 was written by Charles O'Farrell,
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cofarrell/stash-browse-code-plugin" rel="nofollow">
                        https://bitbucket.org/cofarrell/stash-browse-code-plugin
                    </a>
                    My Version 2.0.0 started as a fork and ended up in an updated version to work with the latest Bitbucket Servers.
You can find it here:
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/teufelm/bitbucket-browse-code-plugin" rel="nofollow">
                        https://bitbucket.org/teufelm/bitbucket-browse-code-plugin
                    </a>
                    . Here you can download the plugin-jar which you can directly install into your Bitbucket Server. Yeah !

                    It is available at the Atlassian Marketplace now. Take a look at this:

                    Learning and understanding Soy, get a deeper look into how Atlassians APIs work

                    The first time I fixed and improved code from another guy. And in case of winning something here in this competition  (i dont think this will happen but its worth a try) I will share everything with Charles O'Farrell because of his wonderful idea and his first version which was originally written for the Stash Product renamed into Bitbucket Server now.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soy is not only something to eat. And now I am hungry for more. Not only Soy but also Google Closures gets more and more interesting for me.
