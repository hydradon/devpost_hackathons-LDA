                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that creates a grocery list based on the amount of money that you have. Normally when you don't have very much money and you are hungry you feel like you have to eat poorly and buy junk food. Junk food does fill you up, but we wanted to make it easier to eat healthy even without very much money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to enter the amount of money that they have and their dietary preferences and returns a grocery list consisting of somewhat of a well balanced diet (randomly choosing from the food pyramid categories). The user can then click Purchase to go to Walmart.com or they can click Prepare to Print to write the list to a file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using two classes, TkFinalclass and groceryClass. We had to quickly learn the world of tkinter. The Tk class handles the graphics and the grocery class does the computing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to order the things online (add them to the grocery cart) but we were unable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have something to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That hacking takes a lot of time.

                    What's next for BrokeNHungry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to pull information from the web to get the prices of the food items. Incorporate a database of food items, and potentially order for the user.
