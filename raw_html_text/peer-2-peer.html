                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many college students struggle to find immediate professional advice when it comes to deciding on what steps to take to grow themselves into leaders and skilled contributors of their respective majors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many students are told that "getting involved" and learning to network themselves are critical to the process of making good impressions with hiring companies.  But what does this process actually look like?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peer 2 Peer's goal is to connect university students with working graduates/alumni of the same university who act as mentors to these budding students. What better advice is there than from current contributors/industry leaders who were once students of the same university and in your very shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want Peer 2 Peer to be a platform that removes having to wait months in advance for workshops, seminars, and community events just to get the chance to speak with professionals about what 
you as a student should be striving to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally, Peer 2 Peer would incentivize mentors with the ability to log the hours each they spend each week with students and offer a part of that time as credit for continuing education.
                </p>
