                    Business Statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GE Transportation has a plant in Fort Worth, TX. This plant utilizes carts to move material around the factory to organize and assemble kits. As the carts traverse the plant floor, the plant often has bottlenecks, which can leave carts sitting idle at one station for days at a time. This plant has recently installed RFID tags on all of their carts with scanners at each station in order to track the carts as they flow through. With this new stream of data, the plant urgently needs the capability to intelligently assess their process so they can remove these bottlenecks and drive plant efficiency.

                    Our Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application, FLO (Flow Logistics Optimization) leverages the RFID live data stream of timestamp-ed cart locations along with Predix's dynamic mapping service in order to visualize carts on the map as they move through the plant. This enables plant workers and management to see where carts and kits are along the manufacturing process at any given time. 
Along with this, we've built a set of analytics, which leverage this RFID data to do cycle analysis, empowering management to identify and address performance challenges around kits, stations and employees. 
Lastly, we've configured an Intel&reg; Edison Board with built-in simulation sensors to be applied at the Assembly Stations in Fort Worth, in order to identify potential performance issues early on by visualizing data from sensors on the machines at these work stations.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dynamic Mapping - 
Edison Board: 
Initial configuration provided many challenges for us. Ran into issues with known bugs around Windows 7.
Data: 
We had major challenges with the cleanliness of the data. Currently there are a many repeating records, where the same cart is read multiple times as it passes by an scanner. As well, many airwave frequencies interfere with the RFID system which has caused misreads to be recorded.
