                    INSPIRATION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the existing problems at Aalto University. Students do fascinating projects but are only seen by very few people - especially only from their majors - and the potential in cross-disciplinary innovation is far from being actualised. Becoming more aware of what other students work on could inspire interest in other fields of study and help develop common ground for building great things. The other core issue is the lack of common meeting grounds due to separate faculties. There is a need for actual, physical places that facilitate connection.
                </p>

                    A concept that encourages not only social interaction between faculties but also an exchange of knowledge which would lead to new hybrid combinations and cross-disciplinary collaborations. By showcasing student projects for a broader audience, Stream Space induces two huge benefits: 1) The extension of student works into a &ldquo;public&rdquo; market increases work quality by eliminating unrealistic educational contexts and overvalued individual artistic input; 2) A renewed connection with employers, or other startup partners. Through a wider, global network, other universities and companies around the world are able to follow events and student works in Aalto via the web/mobile app. Thus, connectivity is improved not only on the scale of the campus but also worldwide.

                    Stream app is the touchpoint for students to explore student projects, look into the Stream Spaces and connect with new people. Projects and portfolios are at display here! Through Tinder-like functionalities students can find interesting projects and connect with the authors for potential partnership or just to show their appreciation. Through shared interests, finding business and project partners has never been so easy!

                    The Stream Space is where the Aalto Stream comes to life. A huge screen for showcasing featured student projects and room for leisurely meetings make it the most sophisticated, &ldquo;hi-tech&rdquo;, and inclusive meeting hub of Aalto. Everything is designed for the sole purpose of making people open up to new people and ideas. And of course, connect them. Through live streaming, games and messaging, to other Stream Spaces and viewing hot spots around the campus, faculties can feel connected to each other. The Aalto Stream Space becomes an easily accessible looking glass into a globally available network of student projects and portfolios. Not to mention a tremendous space for relaxing and meeting new people.

                    The interior is designed to be inspiring with a vast open (although zoned) space and fully modular, user buildable block stools. At the same time it is accommodating and relaxing: the soft carpet and curtain screening provide acoustic insulation, whereas mood lighting combined with a ball pit provide a relaxing ambience after a long day of work.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The historical heritage of the building was hard to deal with, as some initial ideas included digging into the ground for the ball pit, or modify walls to alter passages. But we have found an easily erectable scheme by simply overlaying carpet and detachable ball pit, creating almost no modification to the original.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scheduling work and ideation periods in the short amount of time. Having too many ideas and keeping the concept together.

                    We were able to utilize the resources of our multidisciplinary team to their full extent and create a multi-layered concept that is easily understandable. Our resulting theme has addressed both digital and spatial interventions, utilising all of our skills of IT, design and architecture.

                    Bringing an initial prototype to life through user research and testing.
Complete blurring of faculties; transformation into an exceptionally open university
Global expansion: The concept, if spread to other universities, can transform student interactive experiences and also possibly promote cross-university learning between Aalto and other parts of the world as well.
