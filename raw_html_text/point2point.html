                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt Georgia Tech's transportation system was not satisfying our needs, so we decided to find a way to efficiently get around campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web-based application that tracks your location, marks the bus stops around campus, and provides routes and directions from point to point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using html, css, and javascript. The API provided by ESRI created the map on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble creating popups for the points to describe their location, and it was a challenge connecting the API to the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a nice interface for the website, and completing the code for the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect Javascript files to HTML files and connecting HTML files to other HTML files using APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Point2Point
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to limit user interface so there is less searching for map points, adding more bus stops, and creating a mobile application.
                </p>
