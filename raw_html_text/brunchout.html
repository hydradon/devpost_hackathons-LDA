                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my co-workers always have last minute plans to go out to eat, but its always a mess trying to find somewhere to eat without pre-planning. I believe BrunchOut solved this use-case since it allows map location and interactivity with the users using the service.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BrunchOut lets users post places to recommend to go out to brunch to their co-workers. it allows to search the location of the place and add a quick description on why you and your co-workers should go there to eat.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Ionic Framework to build this hybrid app. Some technologies that I used include AngularJS, Google Maps API, MongoDBand Cordova to wrap in a native screen (iOS)
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time building a mongoDB backend, and it was a great learning experience for me since I am mostly a front end person.

                    What's next for BrunchOut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to finish this project so me and my co-workers could use it. Some features that I have in mind are SMS when there are X amount of votes, and emails about upcoming brunches.
