                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to shop for clothing without actually having to go places. Thus, we need an app that allows us to visualize what it's like to wear a shirt without having it on hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine learning to project the shirt onto your body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native to build the UI. The algorithms, based on opencv, run on a node backend, served with express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing react-native and getting the libraries to work together. Working with Unix based systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing a unix-based system without access to a GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have build tools set up before the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InsertShirt.js
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better machine learning algorithms and more AR integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note- Our files greatly exceeded the upload limit of 35 MB, so while we have uploaded nothing to devpost all the source is viewable on our github page.
