                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the "arts" theme initially as a joke about an app that took a picture only when you shook it violently. That got us thinking about what kind of images would be produced by such an app, and we settled on creating Picasso-Like images from user webcam feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program uses a facial recognition library to pick out your facial features from a frame of video and construct boxes around your eyes, nose, lips, and eyebrows, and then flips them upside down. The image is then passed through a filter we built that simplifies the colors, randomly changes some of the most used colors in the frame, and then returning the result. This is all be done real-time through the webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built using the python face_recognition library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest issues we ran into were installing the dependencies to run the libraries and figuring out how to utilize said libraries once they were functional. Additionally, we were planning on hosting this on a website, however, we have limited knowledge on how to run a python app through the browser. However we are now the proud owners of the domain PicassoFace.space even if there's nothing hosted on the site at this time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just learning the new libraries and having fun seeing the app working were very satisfying moments.

                    What's next for PicassoFace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe in the future I'll switch the app from python to javascript and have it running in browser on PicassoFace.space.
