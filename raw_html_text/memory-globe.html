                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to look where I traveled in my whole life on my phone with a brief look at a small earth in my hand. Since i like to travel a lot, I wanna know where I have traveled, and where to travel - preferably the places that i haven't been to yet. At the same time, I wanted a more visual way to store the memories that could appeal to one's eyes much better than facebook photo album, or any kind of album.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores location address and automatically converts it as (longitude, latitude) and create a pin to the corresponding "Memory Globe" of yours in your hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity to create the Memory Globe in android phones, and with unity, it is much easier to make it be available to IOS devices, and web as well. So I get the benefits of providing a better accecibility to the people. I used google geo-coding api in order to contain any kind of address and convert it to (longitude, latitude) so that the user can only focus on enjoying and creating their precious lifetime memories. Most of the coding happened in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since google geo-coding api only returned json or xml type of outcomes, and i had no knowledge about them, I suffered a lot trying to figure how to get the specific information (latitude and longitude).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, by searching bunch of internet resources, and asking help to Capital One mentors and Google mentors, I was able to come up with the way to fetch the specific data that i want. And I'm absolutely sure that I will be using this code again, so I am really satisfied. The fact that I suffered and contemplated so much staying up all night to figure out a way to solve this problem, and eventually making it work!! That feeling of joy, was the best accomplishment from hophacks, my first hackathon in my life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from all the cool new knowledge that I gained, and all the cool people that I met, I really learned how working with other people to come up with something cool, and something valuable is an amazing thing. I felt a lot of appreciation from hackathon in general, and I am definitely willing to participate in a bunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memory Globe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will become the social networking site for travelers or any people who cherish their life and are willing to keep their amazing every moment datafied for future. User will be able to store your memories, photos, and videos. Moreover, you will be able to share the pins with the whole world, or your friends, or make it a private so that you can perish memories with other people or by yourself! Also, you will be able to connect with people around you to make your travel even more enjoyable and valuable by spending time with even more people.
