                    Inspiration: We wanted to develop something in Android (Our first times), using Clairifai's API was motivation we needed to try it out!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Uses tags to identify garbage into catagories {Containers (commonly plastic and glass), paper, organic, landfill}
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Clairifai's API to generate tags, and correspond those to the closest waste management group.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Android for the first time. Attempting to interact with hardware on a low level.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: A super unique idea for an interesting API with a lot of potential.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Different benefits of Android's Activities, but the reduced freedom they may offer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for recycleMe: Introducing it to the IOT (Internet of things) through embedding the software in SMART Trashcans. Maybe we could try using Raspberry Pi!
