                </h2>
                <p>
                    The developed system aims to establish a stronger link among museums (literature, art, science, etc.) and it's visitors by providing a broader interaction and personalization within it's showrooms. The system allows the users to express their emotions and actions in real time and visualize a contemporary art as a result following Kandinsky's theories.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To develop the system the following sofware and tools were used:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Unity 3D
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kinect V2
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge encountered was the connection between these two types of software and the data representation received from the Kinect into Unity 3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment we're proud of was the development of a system able to detect human expresions and interactions and display a contemporary art as a result in the form of Kandisnky using lines, points and planes.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even when you have an SDK the integration between two software is not necesarilly easy. Also we learned to share ideas, work collaboratively and transform thoughts into technological results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VersiColor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve upon the resulting prototype and develop new characteristics such as voice recognition and other gestures to make the interaction and usability a lot more efficient and functional.
