                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to banking,marketing offers &amp; products is very crucial.We researched  behind it and built an AR interactive platform where user can get to know about the offers without much effort.

                    What Fusion GrabOn does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is an AR interactive platform where the user in a specific location can see various offers nearby provided by bank which he can grab on a click. This would bridge the gap between bank and customers, thus helping bank to promote offers that energize existing customers and attract new customers
