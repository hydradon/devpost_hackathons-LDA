                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into the hackaton hoping to be inspired by some of the Challenges proposed by the hackaton's sponsors. Itequia's made us think of the great possibilities such a software could have
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web allows the user to connect to a lobby (identified by a code), and draw and send emojis in a given canvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the whole web, and node.js and socket.io for the connection to the server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience in any of the aforementioned subjects, so we had to learn it all from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lobby management is something we are really proud of, as well as the general feel of the web
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but more importantly, how to manage a project with other people as it was the first hackaton for some of us
                </p>

                    What's next for RTBoard
