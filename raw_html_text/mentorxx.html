                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To honor the spirit of a women-centric hackathon, we decided to hack together a project that promotes and supports the involvement of women in STEM. Many women in male-dominated STEM fields often struggle to feel like they belong in their workplaces and academic communities, as women have less presence in these spaces. In order to combat this issue that women face, we sought to create a system in which women would be better able to find and create communities and seek support.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack is essentially a website that allows for women to find and contact mentors or mentees, based on their major, location, and interests. Users of this website will become a part of a collection of profiles, categorized as either mentor or mentee, and it will recommend the best individuals for them to contact based on their own information.

                <p>
                    In order to save and organize all of the incoming and previously existing profiles, we used Firebase. Each individual is an entry in our database that has a series of attributes that make up that individual's profile. We used javascript to handle user interaction with our website, which allows the users to search for people as well as enter their own information and receive recommendations.

                    Most of our issues came with debugging our javascript code.

                    How to implement both the front and back ends of a webpage.

                    What's next for MentorXX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MentorXX is based on an easily expandable concept, which allows for the range of what the webpage can become to be very large. For example, some features that we brainstormed but did not have time to implement was to create an option to search for women-centric events, and provide contacts for planning events such as these. Additionally, we would plan to create user profiles, as well as a method for users to contact eachother on the site, rather that just receiving contact information through the site.
