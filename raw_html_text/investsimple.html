                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New startups and early-stage projects are faced with many challenges to get themselves off the ground. Many of these startups may be looking for initial capital, there aren&rsquo;t many options. Angel investment and large sums of debt financing aren&rsquo;t available to any regular person. Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo are great to collect many small contributions for small projects, but lack the infrastructure to provide support for the long-term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InvestSimple allows both big and small investors to invest in long-term projects or companies, in exchange for rewards or stake/equity. InvestSimple is different from other equity crowdfunding platforms because we reinvest initial investments with WealthSimple services. Rather than having invested capital sitting around in a  savings account, the money is being invested in low-cost and liquid ETFs that compound initial investments and reinvest dividends, earning the company more.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with Express/MongoDB/Oauth2. Learning all the technologies while creating this project was challenging, but very rewarding.
