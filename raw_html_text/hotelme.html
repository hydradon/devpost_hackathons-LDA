                    While the world is ever changing and technology is evolving faster and faster the hotel industry hasn't caught up. Much of your stay at a hotel relies larger on using the front desk at very specific times and much information is still presented on paper.

                <h2>
                    HotelMe allows the hotel to input information about the user and their reservation, HotelMe will hold all the data and send a registration code to the user. The user can input this code and then is able to checkin online, obtain a digital room key, call staff directly from own phone, confirm reservation remotely, order room service, look up attractions and restaurants nearby and check out all on a mobile device.
