                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitness does not only have to be for people who go to the gym regularly! Our inspiration for this app was to make a seamless workout experience with the Amazon Alexa for people who want to workout in the comfort of their own homes. We wanted to integrate Alexa with hardware sensors and a camera, so she can analyze your workout and make sure you follow through (for the lazy people out there!). With this app, fitness can be for anyone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had 2 IOT devices (raspberry pis) that were used to collect data on the workout. One pi is secured on the arm to collect acceleration data and another pi is placed in front of the user to record their workout and check form. These devices asynchronously send the data to the Alexa, which can give feedback to the user through the app. E
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use machine learning to analyze the accelerometer data and give accurate feedback on the quality and amount of push ups. We also use visualization algorithms to analyze the user and count how many squats, jumping jacks, burpees, etc. they do. This data is relayed to the user at the end of the workout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 Raspberry Pis, one with accelerometer and one with pi cam, to analyze workout. Linear Regression analysis on collected accelerometer data and OpenCV algorithms to count reps. Amazon alexa api and lambda functions to drive the workout experience. Publisher-Subscriber IOT frameworks to asynchronously send data to the backend SQL database on which the Alexa checks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the flow control for the Amazon Alexa, and making it "work" with the sensors
Integrating all the data from the sensors and relaying it to the Alexa during the workout
Figuring out Publisher Subscriber IOT frameworks and getting all the moving components to integrate together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to use sensors asynchronously and integrate it with the Alexa flow for the app.
Learning about and using IOT microservices APIs.
Our first hardware hack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use IOT microservice apis, Amazon Alexa apis/lambda functions, and learning how to read and interpret data from hardware sensors.

                <p>
                    Different types of workouts, intergration with MyFitnessPal apis, Fitbit integration, heart rate sensors.
