                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge that seemed meaningful and doable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It cleans addresses so that packages get delivered in the right place as soon as possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I downloaded a big dataset that lists the addresses in the USA and used it to clean the messy addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    downloading the big files on an overloaded network was hard
working through the logic to cover all cases
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the logic flow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    not everything needs machine learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for addressCleaner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    make it opensource maybe
                </p>
