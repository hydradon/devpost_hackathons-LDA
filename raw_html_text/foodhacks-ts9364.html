                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration to our idea came from the DubHacks Team Formation activity. One of the questions that we were asked during this activity was what kind of charity we would create. When hearing this question one of our team members remembered that they had been thinking about a charity years ago that could help decrease the amount of food wasted in the U.S. each year. Currently throughout the world, around 40% of food created ends up being not eaten and thrown away. Inspired by this drastic statistic and the current Seattle homeless crisis, our team decided to create a project that could make it easy for businesses to have an efficient and straight-forward medium to donate food on a consistent basis

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FoodHacks is an online web service that uses a database of non-perishable foods that businesses can register and add to, and non-profit feeding services can transfer and request food from. What's next is that we plan to add tax-break services to businesses who donate, and algorithms to predict and set limits for organizations to request certain amounts of goods.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project through creating a Web Server with express which connects to an online Postgres Database and a React ui. This is a full stack JavaScript application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with the initial back-end framework. Initially we tried to use Spring Boot to implement the web server, but found it very complicated to execute simple tasks. Furthermore we would have had to program the back-end framework with Java which would have been out of our scope for the given time.
