                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by problems in the health field. The visually impaired routinely suffer from visual challenges associated with recognition of people they know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows for easy recognition of faces using OpenCV. This essentially identitifies faces in a video feed and actively matches it to people in a contacts list. This is then sent to a Fitbit which notifies the wearer of the person's identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV, python, flask and heroku to build it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Experimenting with flask and heroku as well as the FitBit API were challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the progress we made in learning about new technologies and having the chance to tie them all together in a meaningful way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how we could utilize the FitBit SDK. It was really interesting to understand what kind of applications it has in the health space.
                </p>

                    What's next for InstaFace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expansion into other devices perhaps or increasing the our sensitivity on detection
