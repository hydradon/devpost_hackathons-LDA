                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team members of
                    <strong>
                        Lost Mode
                    </strong>
                    were inspired by previous events that occurred to them where they were lost inside huge buildings. Team members formulated the idea and build it up through brainstorming and hearing from mentors to construct and reconstruct to reach a better defined result.

                    <strong>
                        Lost Mode
                    </strong>
                    assists people to find locations indoors, through a new technique where we guide the person to the desired location using snippets of spread-out QR codes throughout the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When entering a building, a QR code is displayed at the entrance - replacing the job of an information desk. When this QR code is scanned, it launches a web application that displays a list of places to choose from. For instance, a user selects Meeting Room 201, the web application will starts to calculate the coordinates of
                    <strong>
                        point A
                    </strong>
                    to
                    <strong>
                        point B
                    </strong>
                    - where the meeting room exists. This calculation is done by formulating a function that calculates the distance between the two point. After calculating the web application will display a popup message with the full directions to the desired place.

                    is built using Visual Studio and SQL server, where data is stored in a database and integrated with a web application that is programmed in ASP.NET and C#/SQL queries - with HTML and CSS for styling.

                    is built using multiple mathematical functions to calculate the distance and the coordinates of  certain destination. These data are stored in a database that doesn't require constant updating, unless there has been a change to any location.
