                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by an event on our way to the hackathon. We had gotten to the hackathon at different times but realized that the large crowd obstructed us from finding each other. Later, we were texting, and calling but we had no exact way of pinpointing each other. We realized that there is a potential for an application that can connect people together.
                </p>

                    Connects people together.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with APIs, and struggled with some code.

                    We finished!

                    We learned about databases, andriod, and concurrency!

                <p>
                    We plan to continue implementing features into

                    </em>
