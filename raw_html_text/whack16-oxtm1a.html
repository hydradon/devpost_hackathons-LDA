                    At Wellesley, through one of the Office of Disability Services' programs, students are paid to takes for one or many students in the class who needs accommodation for a disability.

                    We reached out to a student who worked as a note taker and he described the process as cumbersome. He had to take notes by hand, photocopy the document, and drop them off at an office with limited hours that didn&rsquo;t always align with his class schedule. Our system bypasses these complications and makes learning accessible to more people.
