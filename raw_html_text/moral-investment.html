                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from PIMCO&rsquo;s challenge to allow people to invest morally and promoting positive social change. With complex economies and global supply chains, it is near impossible to enforce proper working conditions in developing nations. Some companies release audits of their factories abroad and even less release a full suppliers list. Our goal is to accumulate the data companies release and display the data to empower users to make decisions within their morals on how to invest their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website displays to users the complexity of making moral investments. The page opens with a mapping of five companies and the suppliers which they share. The goal of the website is to allow the user to easily research these suppliers to determine whether the user believes the policies of companies that license these companies. Our website has the capability of evaluating companies based on modern slavery index, employment protections, and overall financial health. Ideally, a score is submitted that evaluates any company, but the goal is not to take away the decision making from the user.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program in react and using a neo4j and a mongodb database on Microsoft azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some in our group, it was their first time working with react. Members spent time learning the documentation and not necessarily progressing the project. In addition to the time to learn, we spent a decent amount of time doing research for the suppliers list, environmental protections indices, labor protection indices, and modern slavery indices. Regarding the code, one member that spent a lot of time on an autocomplete component that ended up getting scrapped because of a misunderstanding of react architecture. One member spent a dedicated amount of time to starting and integrating the azure service. Another spent time building the neo4j database.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For four strangers meeting randomly, I am proud of how well we worked together. Everyone was honest with their strengths and weaknesses. We did our best to help one another to learn and understand the project. I am also proud of the end result and concept. Our vision may have been too wide but what we built is valuable and interesting.

                    What's next for Moral Investment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next sequence for Moral Investment is to expand to different industries and not just focus on the electronics market. When we first started, we discussed using data from clothing companies, an industry known for harmful labor practices. Documenting the clothing industry is an interesting movement for Moral Investment.
