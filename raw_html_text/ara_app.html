                    AR Tutoring App
We were inspired to make this app when we realized the disconnect between online tutors and students who were learning. We further realized that tutors weren't able to access the proper tools, and that all of the online tutoring we encountered was focused around education. So we came up with ARA, the learning platform that uses AR drawing and images as tools for online tutors and students to interact through a friendly mobile service. We learned about the difficulties as well as some of the technologies that go into AR as well as some of the UI design elements, through the new SwiftUI framework. We learned how to troubleshoot the project in Xcode, given that 1 of our group members had never made an app before. We built the app using the UIKit, ARKit, and SwiftUI technologies. We faced difficulties using the beta versions of the software and solved the issues using the limited Apple documentation.
