                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can't speak highly enough of bike share programs - they make getting places quickly cost-efficient and environmentally-friendly. However, one of our biggest frustrations with the Indego B-Cycle apps is the lack of feature to find the nearest available bike or empty dock from your phone. Sure, we could click around the app to see how many bikes or docks are at each station, but that hardly seemed the best use of our time. We also couldn't see how many bikes might be at a given station at some time, say, on Tuesday - what if we needed to plan for a trip we knew we wanted or needed to take? That wasn't an option with the old B-Cycle app. We decided to make this app to make our lives easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Indegogo, you can see the nearest station with (up to 5) available bikes or empty docks, so that you can figure out the least distance you have to walk to arrive at your destination. With predictive analytics using Indego station history data, you can also see how many bikes will be at any given station at any time on any day of the week.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us are designers, but somehow we managed to make the app look (at least in our eyes) presentable. We also learned how to use Android Studio all by ourselves and build the app within 16 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we're pretty persistent when we want to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Indegogo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better predictive analysis based on weather and events, and expansion to other cities, perhaps!
