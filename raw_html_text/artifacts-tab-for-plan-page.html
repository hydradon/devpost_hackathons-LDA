                    From time to time I have heard complaints from the colleagues that it's hard to find the build archive (artifact in terms of Bamboo) with the required version of the corresponding source control revision.
Bamboo numerates builds 1, 2, 3, 4 ... . We would like to see the revision number (Git/Perforce/AccuRev/... ). I need to use mouse a lot to find "Commit" (revision number) on build page and additional several clicks to download an artifact of this build.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a additional "Artifacts" tab for the Plan page. There is a table of all builds with the revisions numbers, comments, and artifacts. I can easily overview all new and all commits and download the required build archive (Artifact).

                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I built it using Atlassian SDK and reading a lot of documentations.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I have never written a Java application, moreover a Spring framework and I did not have time to learn it. I need to do my work and have time for my family. Surprisingly, I did not have a problem with Java. My knowledge in python and javascript is enough. I have looked only at several code samples. The biggest part of programming languages have the same skeleton. 
I stuck on wrapping my servlet output. If the user click F5 then bamboo reloads my Tab and shows the build grid without Bamboo GUI around (Bamboo menu, toolbar, etc.) I tried to apply decorator  without an effect. I estimated time for looking deeply into the documentation and googling and preferred inventing for a workaround. 
The servlet loads html page where javascript change URL in address bar by  window.history.replaceState to /browse/ + planKey + /planartifacts. If user click F5 then the servlet filter parses the URL and redirects to /browse/planKey The default tab of the Plan is displayed.
