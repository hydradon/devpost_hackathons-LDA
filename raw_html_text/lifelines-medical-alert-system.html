                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are too many times in which someone with dementia or of senior age loses their way when trying to complete what seems like the simplest of life tasks, leading to serious amounts of stress from both their families and their providers when trying to find them. This device is made to help alleviate said stress and bring peace to their care takers by not only making sure they can be located, but also being able to know if they have fallen and injured themselves. We all also believed it was important to incorporate a temperature gauge in the design in order to have an idea of what kind of heath challenges they could face due to the weather (heat stroke, frost bite, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The device will sense if the user has entered a dangerous temperature area, if they have fallen, and it also has the ability to show the users current and most recent location for cases where they get lost. The device itself will send a text notification to alert the users family and/or care provider to let them know if any of the previously stated issues has occurred.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with testing out what temperature sensors and GPS locators would work best for our breakout board/ arduino. We then went online and researched what type of coding language/program would support the coding of each sensor best and would display how we wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We received a broken sensor that we were going to use to determine the user's heart rate in case of either personally informing the user, and for their own safety in case of emergency. However, we had to scrap that idea from our project once we discovered that he sensor was broken, and continue with the rest of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a new group working together for the first time, with three of our five members being first time hackathon attendees, and because of that we are very proud of the teamwork and collaboration that we displayed. 
We are also proud of the project itself, as some of the libraries used to interface with the hardware were poorly documented, so we had to put in extra time to truly learn the hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the GPS Board, how to set up a heart rate sensor (although it was broken), and how to set up a GPS tracker. Three of our team members; Gabrielle Granata, Sabrina Storey and Sarah VanDeMark attended their first hackathon here at Codestellation 2019, so they also learned the basics to what a hackathon entails.
More than anything, we learned how to work together as a group, and what strength and weaknesses the members or our group possess, so for the future, we can work together even more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifelines Medical Alert System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up we will get our GPS system to have alerts like the app LIFE360 where you can set up parameters and it will tell you when the user leaves the place in which they take residence. This will alert their care takers and nearby police of their disappearance. We also have established a target audience for our product; it can be used in mental-help facilities, where the residents tend to wander off often, and eventually, once we get our temperature gauge results to be more detailed and precise, our device can be used in hospitals to help in constantly monitoring the patients temperature to help determine before hand if the patient may be in danger. 
We of course, would also want to update the capabilities of our hardware to make a more compressed model that also has cell network access so that it can be used anywhere and it's signal can always be reached.
