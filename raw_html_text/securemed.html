                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my team and I were brainstorming, we talked about how the elderly, people with disabilities, and college students all have a common issue they face: remembering to take medication. Whether it be daily vitamins or medicine to regulate blood sugar, it is a hassle to remember when and how much medication to take. Especially now that we are at peak flu season, it is imperative that those who are sick, old and young, remember their doctor's orders and to take good care of their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Securemed is an easy and safe to use device that will use AI face recognition technology to recognize patients' faces and dispense medication accordingly based off of time of day and proper dosage. This alleviates the hassle of remembering when and how much medication to take, and also ensures that individuals are only receiving the medication prescribed by their doctors. This prevents overdose and makes individuals' lives easier so that in the hustle and bustle of life, we can focus on the things that actually matter: the time we spend with family and friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using the Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, and servos. We designed and 3D printed a prototype SecureMed dispenser using SolidWorks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally planned to use other hardware such as the Dragonboard and the NKK switches, but outdated software and hardware difficulties that we wrestled with for hours led us to think of alternatives to preserve our vision for this project while not compromising on quality and efficacy.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning how to use the Raspberry Pi, applying our Solidworks and Arduino skills from our first EE course at UCSD, and making a project we had dreamed of a few hours ago become a reality. During our brainstorming session, we divided up the work and were able to make the most of each of our strengths to execute this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Raspberry Pi and that new software and hardware require a lot of time to troubleshoot issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SecureMed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make a better SecureMed dispesner with capabilities of holding a larger quantity of pills so that they do not need to be refilled as often. We would also solder the components and improve the algorithm so that the facial recognition software ensures that patients are not mixed up with other individuals.
