                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    West Chester is a very large campus that can be difficult for new or transfer students to navigate. 
To alleviate this, we wanted to build a simulation to allow anyone in the world to tour the campus without having to come to WCU
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to explore part of West Chester's campus in 3D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Meshroom, an open source photogrammetry suite, to process over a hundred photos we took of the Fredrick Douglass statue and surrounding buildings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very often, the program would focus on the wrong objects in the scene, and fail to render the ones we wanted. It took several attempts with different photo sets to get the program to render the details we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to take photogrammetric photos and process them using free software to produce 3d models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VirtualWCU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more photos focusing on different buildings, we can stitch the models together to expand our simulation. First, we want to cover the academic quad, and after that, the rest of the campus. With enough time and patience, we could also model the interiors of buildings, allowing remote students to find their classrooms.
