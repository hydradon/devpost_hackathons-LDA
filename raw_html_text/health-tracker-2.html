                    Inspiration:
It is a big problem for patients to seek medical treatment now. Hospitals in different places have different data systems. Many times they cannot communicate the medical taboos of patients.
We want to develop a health tracking app to help patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
It is a personal health record tracking and health advisor in your pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
We use a cross platform framework angular &amp; ionic to develop the app. We use firebase &amp; google's AI api.
                </p>
