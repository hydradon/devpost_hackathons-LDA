                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a navigation tool for campus and a way to associate memories with a place you'll call home for four years.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays all buildings, floors, classrooms on campus. You can add notes and images associated with a class. That data is not shared with anyone but the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created and hosted on AWS, my own API for this hackathon. The data that I am displaying is not publicly available so that was the reason I designed my own data. I designed an iOS app using Swift which calls my API and loads the data into different Table Views. You can navigate through these lists to get to the notes/images section where you can add and delete data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating my own API. I had never done this before. 95% of my time at this hackathon was me trying to set up an API, host it on AWS Lambda, figure out get/post requests, and calling the API from my app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating my own API, understanding more about iOS development in the last two hours than I have in the past two months
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work in a team next time. This is my ninth hackathon, but my first solo hackathon. A lot of the tasks could have been simplified even if I had just one extra team member. I also learnt a lot about APIs, the AWS platform, and Asynchronous functions in Swift.
                </p>

                    What's next for UniNavigate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting reliable data from the University after proving credibility, getting the app on the App Store, possible collaboration with UTO to authenticate or integrate my service into existing ASU apps, figuring out a business plan that goes beyond simple non-skippable pop-up ads.
