                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShadowHero is inspired by the data available through the
                    <a href="https://github.com/HackHarassment/TwitterClassifier" rel="nofollow">
                        HackHarassment data repository on GitHub
                    </a>
                    . The sheer quantity of this data shows the need for an intelligent online agent like ShadowHero.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShadowHero silently listens to online user interactions. If a harassment situation is detected, ShadowHero will make a decision about how to handle the situation. The online anti-harassment activities that ShadowHero can execute are designed to quickly stop harassment as soon as it starts.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShadowHero use the ChatterBot framework to create a chatbot agent that can monitor online chat rooms. Tools and data from the
                    <a href="https://github.com/HackHarassment/TwitterClassifier" rel="nofollow">
                        Hack Harassment data repository
                    </a>
                    on GitHub were used to train the bot to identify harassment situations.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, I needed a chat room to demonstrate the application with. At first I attempted to get it set up with Slack's API, but I couldn't get authentication to work correctly. To apply my available time more effectively I chose to 
use HipChat's API instead.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShadowHero represents a fully functional prototype and can be easily demonstrated to show it's effectiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project helped me to expand my skills and knowledge regarding various open data and data analysis tools that are available to developers.

                    What's next for ShadowHero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to build a community around ShadowHero to support the software and expand it's functionality. The following two items are the highest priority at the moment.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Adding support for ShadowHero to connect to additional social media sites and chat rooms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creation of an infrastructure that will allow ShadowHero to monitor numerous online sites for cases of harassment.
