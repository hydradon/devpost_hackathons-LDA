                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us across campus are united by dorms without air conditioning. During the summer days, we must keep fans on to regulate the humidity. However, as the temperature drops at night, many of us are forced to wake up to turn off our fans. Having this cool feature will allow us to finally get a good night's sleep.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses the SenseHat feature on the Raspberry Pi to collect data on relative humidity and temperature. We used this data to calculate the dew point and ensure that a fan successfully regulated the temperature at night. We used firebase to manage the data and a website to manage the user's humidity preferences.
