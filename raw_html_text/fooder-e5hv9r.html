                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized how many cases of major illnesses could be prevented by diet and what eating healthier, more diverse diets could do for society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fooder tracks personal grocery habits and nutritional information through user grocery purchases, highlights potential deficiencies, and suggests foods to fill the gaps to improve dietary health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Django python web development framework, and used Bootstrap for the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I used an open dataset for a program that I developed, and learning to integrate that into the Django web development framework during the hackathon was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have developed a product that can save lives
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that the social impact of a computer program is just as important as the technical capabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fooder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, the web application of Fooder will contain more features for diet management, and the product will also come in the form of a mobile application.
