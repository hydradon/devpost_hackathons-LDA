                    is a multi-page application built with mobile responsiveness. For the backend, we employed a Google Cloud Firebase Realtime Database built with a personally designed schema. We also integrated APIs such as the ZipCode API to match users of the app based on location information.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Firebase into React wasn't an easy task. None of us had any production experience with Firebase and we had a hard time understanding to fetch and update data in Firebase.  Planning the design of the database to make our queries seem instantaneous was also a challenging task. We also had some trouble with some front-end elements such as aligning items in the NavBar, and using bootstrap with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But perhaps the biggest challenge we faced was incorporating asynchronous methods/queries. As we did not have prior experience dealing with async/await in React, ensuring that the various components in our website were updated accurately was a huge challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of

                <p>
                    During the ideation process, one of our teammates came up with the idea for this app since he is an aspiring filmmaker who noticed the absence of such a platform. All existing competitors allow users to connect one-on-one but lack the functionality of team formation. However, this is not ideal as filmmaking is a collaborative process. We are proud that we were able to implement our ambitious idea and bring it to reality during the short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since no one on our team was good at web design, we had to learn CSS on the fly to make a good looking web application. We also learned about asynchronous actions and server-less computing. Moreover, the multi-function Firebase really stood out to us.
