                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not many people know about several forms of Cryptography, so this is a great way to educate them. This game is also created with the intent of breaking the stereotype of videogames spoon-feeding vital intel to players. This game actually requires players to do special research on the Internet, so as to encourage an open-minded and self-directed approach to tasks and learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game to entertain and inform. It is aimed to inculcate a positive learning attitude within the audience. It deals with cryptography and has an interesting storyline.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ on (Repl.it) to develop our game, as it is very comfortable for us, and it has a group collaboration function letting us code at the same time. We also used Google Docs to plan the storyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the storyline, definitely. We spent a lot more time finding encoding and decoding websites and writing the storyline and diary entries. The coding was manageable, but we still ran into some problems, such as not knowing what code to use to make certain things happen. We did some research and found simple solutions that could be used.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a completely original idea from scratch.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is on the Internet, we just need to know how to search and find it. Also, if something does not work, try all possible ways to fix it, and not be lazy with it. Lastly, we learned that any idea can be implemented into code with enough focus and time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cobalt Enigma
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to make it into a Visual game that also includes other elements of cryptography. We can probably use Unity or Gamemaker 2 for this project. We strongly feel that Cobalt Enigma has potential and that we are going to do our very best to make it the best it can be. With an engaging storyline and interesting puzzles, we think that it is by far the best project that we have made so far.
