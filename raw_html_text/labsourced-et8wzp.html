                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of undergraduate and graduate researchers, we oftentimes ran into situations where we needed to use medical products for pilots projects that only lasted few weeks or months. Therefore, we had to network around other labs by emailing principal investigators (PI) that we knew and, since the university is relatively large, we didn't have a list of all labs and equipments that we needed. The need to have an easily accessible database came to mind: Labsourced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LabSourced makes finding and contacting labs from all over the country easier and faster than ever before to help facilitate medical research. Subscribe as an individual or an institution and create a profile with all of your available lab equipment, cell lines, or research animals that you may want to donate or rent out to encourage collaborations with other labs. Once you&rsquo;ve listed what you can share, you will then have a wide range of resources available to you by searching through other profiles.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to facilitate sharing of laboratory and medical equipments, the best way to set up a collaboration or to built a sharing community was to build a website. Indeed, Labsourced was built using an HTML platform named sublime-text.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of biomedical researchers, we have never built a website before; therefore, it was a great challenge for us to accomplish what we pursued, but we were determined to make our product successful. It was a bit testing to learn HTML Initially, but once we established a solid foundation, our uphill battle was transformed into a downhill course with a few bumps on the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to deliver a working website, with almost all functionalities. Most importantly, we are also glad and  awe-inspired that we were able to take on a problem that we encountered in our research life and come up with an ideal solution for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn a valuable lesson that can be described as crossed discipline,
                    <strong>
                        patience
                    </strong>
                    . Indeed, just as experimenting with cells, animals, and other labs tools, writing a new language requires a lot of patience and perseverance.
                </p>

                    What's next for LabSourced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course we want to take this idea to fruition. We want to collaborate with universities across the nation or later on across the world to make equipments, resources, and space sharing easily accessible for all.
