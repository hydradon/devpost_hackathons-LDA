                    As we brainstormed, we realized that the choices high school students (teens) make, will shape the outcome of their lives. So we came across an idea of creating a website where students interact with career experts and exchange ideas in order for the students to make better decisions. We also decided to have a day in a life option. This means that students will be able to request shadowing -They spend a day in a work space of their career dream. This will help students experience and decisions on whether they would stick to it, or try other careers/ fields.
