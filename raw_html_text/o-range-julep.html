                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a dark and generally clear night. Food was being served, coffee was being drank, but most importantly, a group of misfits were 12 hours into a hack-a-thon without having written a single line of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We're here to have fun," they insisted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's all about the learning process," they joked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Say, do you want to go to Orange Julep?" one of them piped up at midnight. "I saw it on tripadvisor and I want to eat."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tunnel vision was both a weakness and a strength for this odd group of free-agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The uber was expensed, but the memories created weren't. The orange and cream concoction (I heard the secret ingredient is powdered egg?) activated dopamine receptors. The swirly, orangey goodness hit directly to the brain... and generated an idea that none of knew we needed until we didn't have it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        So we made it.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compasses work by using the magnetic poles up North and down South. Who decided that these poles were THAT important? People go to Orange Julep everyday; last time I checked, the South Pole doesn't generate the same customer stream that the iconic Julep does.
                </p>

                    The bright orange as the center of the Earth.
                    <em>
                        Doesn't it make sense?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Orange Julep acts as the benchmark for all navigational tools. Anytime, anywhere - You can find out your exact distance to the Julep, and the relative direction to walk towards that sweet, sweet, nectar.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Flutter, Android Studio, and a whole bunch of other packages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud to have completed an app after starting after a 1am Orange Julep trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Orange Julep slaps. Absolutely Slaps.
