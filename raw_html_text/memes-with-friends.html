                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cards against humanity is already a hilarious game and memes are hilarious in their own right so why not combine both together?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two players go against each other. A random meme and topic is selected and then both players have to come up with a clever description. There is one or more players who vote for the dankest meme. The players rotate out so everyone has a chance to play and the player with the most upvotes wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our database we used RethinkDB as our actual database and horizon.io to interact with the database. We used vue.js to make live updating easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team did not know how to use HTML,CSS, and JS so they had to learn on the fly. Also this was all of our first times using RethinkDB,horizon.io, and vue.js so the entire team was at a disadvantage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite having to learn languages and frameworks on the fly, we were able to slowly make progress towards our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development and the interactions between a database and web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memes With Friends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to fully complete the project during the hackathon so we may continue development outside of the event.
