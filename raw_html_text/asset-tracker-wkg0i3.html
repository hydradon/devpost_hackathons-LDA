                <h2>
                    How we built it - Using Vue, React, Javascript and CSS. A big part of our project came from Blockstack's libraries and tutorials.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Learning and understanding Blockstack, setting up authentication, using Blockstack developer tools on bash, using Blockstack tutorials to eventually make changes and build our DApp.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Learning how repositories in Git work, setting up authentication, understanding the basic concepts of Blockstack, implementing the basic functionality of our DApp.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - We need to spend more time doing tutorials and we need to brush up on our HTML, CSS, JS skills. It would also be beneficial to learn Vue and React, as it was our first time using the Vue framework and React library. Understand data structures and formats better would allow us to gain a better understanding of more projects in the future to come.
