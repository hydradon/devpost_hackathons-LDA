                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be cool to be able to see events going on around you with an UBER style interface. I have often found it difficult to find enough people to get together for a game of pick-up soccer so I thought this app would make things easier for people to come together to enjoy activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to create events, see others people's events, and like an event to show you who will be attending. You find events simply by searching the globe via google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Google maps and Facebook APIs as well as an AWS server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge I had was the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I learned how to use a couple new APIs and built a functional prototype in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is often the thing you least expect thats breaking your code. Usually it is not your algorithm, but rather a missed semi-colon or other trivial element causing the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NearMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am planning on creating an iOS app as well to allow for a richer mobile experience as well as give people the opportunity to download a NearMe app.
