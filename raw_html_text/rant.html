                    The original app I created with a clone. I'm a little embarassed looking at it to be honest. I want to do something that helps people. I've had quite a bit of experience with recoveries. It is hard. Really hard. And support from others, even if it is from strangers, is key to recovery. People feel alone. Like they are the only ones that feel a certain way or that they are the only ones that have such a hard time recovering. It's not true. While there are differences, the underlying root addiction and illness is the same. So I've created ReKover to allow people to reward each other meaninfully a little more than elsewhere. With Kin it's just a little extra. Words are the best in a social app site but I feel this will add that extra touch.
