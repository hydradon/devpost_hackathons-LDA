                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prevention and education are key. My family's medical history is rooted in heart disease, high blood pressure, and Diabetes II. These are conditions that have resulted from poor life choices (unhealthy diet, lack of exercise) and ignorance. That's what inspired me to create this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NutriTracker is a personal app that tracks the nutrients users ingest day to day. Based on a user's profile, it highlights certain areas which the user needs to pay special attention to and alerts them when they have exceed the average daily recommended measurement for their particular needs. The purpose of the app is to ensure that the user stays on track of maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. It is tailored to their specific needs since the average daily recommendation for nutrients are different for average healthy adults and people with health conditions.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using front-end languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I also used Google's Search API and U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Composition Database API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USDA's Food Composition Database does not cover all the foods that I hoped it would. There are also still a lot missing features in my app. Since I worked alone, it was a challenge trying to get a fully functioning app with front-end and back-end features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I chose to work on an idea that I'm interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NutriTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NutriTracker doesn't end here; this is just the beginning. Once I learn to program back-end, I'll be able to transform this app into one that is fully functional with the core features that I envision it to have.
