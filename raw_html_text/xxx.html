                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard Work and Caffeine!  Used Github, Android Studio, Youtube API, Android Device, and Adobe Illustrator for this project.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Little sleep, over thinking a line of code, Adobe Illustrator crashing&hellip; The normal daily grind of every coder and designer.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we wanted to use ChromeCast as part of the project.  After running into unforeseen obstacles though, we dropped that part of our project.  However, we were able to collaborate, discuss, and improvise for our project.  Without good communication we would not have been able to conquered that hurdle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much more about Chrome cast, Androids, HTTP Requests, JSON, APIs, Client Server communication, Teamwork and Development Setting, UI / UX Development.
                </p>
