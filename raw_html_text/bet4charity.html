                        Since many gambling website is focusing on making profit for their own, we found that it is a great opportunity for these websites to build up connection with philanthropy events.

                    <p>
                        First, we use django to build up our data frame and database. Then, we separate our work into front end and back end. For front end, we used css, javascript and html to implement. For back end, we web-scrapped live sports data from ESPN.go.com and put them into our database. At the same time, we adopted Capital One API to achieve payment transaction between users, bet4charity, and American Cancer Society.

                    <p>
                        Initially, we were thinking about adopting blockchain API to encrypt users' data and bitcoin payment transaction. Unfortunately, since the API of this technique is only associate with bitcoin storage and security, it's infeasible for us to create a new API involving in blockchain technique regard to other data from users.

                        We are able to utilize the economic advantage of a gambling website to do something beneficial to society.
We are proud of using Capital One API to facilitate us to achieve this goal.
We have lots of good understanding on blockchain technique.

                        We learned to use Capital One API to POST, PUT and GET accounts, purchases, transfers, and deposits data. 
We also learned to use django to build up our data frame and database in a clean, efficient way. 
In addition, we figured out how to get the live sport data we need from the HTML source in a economic way.
