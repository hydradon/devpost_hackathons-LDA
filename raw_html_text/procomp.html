                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who enjoy building hardware projects, we've always felt that finding the components required for a project online is quite cumbersome. Having to individually lookup each component tends to become tedious so we decided to automate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ProComp automates the process of looking for components online via Robotic Process Automation using UIPath. You can look up a project on
                    <a href="https://hackaday.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        hackaday.io
                    </a>
                    and ProComp will find all the components listed within the project and look up each component on
                    <a href="https://octopart.com" rel="nofollow">
                        octopart.com
                    </a>
                    . If the component isn't found on Octopart, ProComp will perform a general google search for the component.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use UIPath from scratch, and figuring out how to map elements on the website using UIExplorer within a short time frame.

                    We got it up and running!

                <p>
                    We learned how to use UIPath for Robotic Process Automation.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to have ProComp compare prices across websites, and individually add each component to the cart on the website that offers it at the lowest price.
