                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining the aspects of social media with having a buddy system.

                <p>
                    MedPals is a site whose goal is to bring those suffering from similar medical conditions together. Instead of making a simple support group page, our website works to create one-on-one connections. For example, two children with cystic fibrosis may find each other on MedPals and rely on each other to remember to take their prescriptions, to live healthy life styles and to act as outlets for one another so that they realize that they aren't alone. It can also act as a way to connect the parents of these children because they suffer as well, and MedPals offers them a way to realize that they aren't alone.
