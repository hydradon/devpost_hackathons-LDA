                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with the experience we learned from the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team that was falling apart, and with less motivation than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to do a pitch even though the program we wanted to do initially was far from completed

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is the most important part of a project, it determines how well or quickly you can build a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Teamwork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot from our very first Hackathon especially from the team aspect. We learned our mistakes and we won't redo it again. For the next Hackathon, we'll plan the project in advance and make sure that our team agrees with it and a team that we trust.
