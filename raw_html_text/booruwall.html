                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with my likeness towards the Danbooru API. Which is easy and very user friendly, by using JSON in order to retrieve data off their servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a
                    <em>
                        BIG
                    </em>
                    fan of anime and the Japanese culture, so I decided to do something just because I thought it would be fun, and it was indeed, very fun to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an application that searches in the Danbooru Image board, searching for Images with the corresponding tags provided by the user in the application. The user has the option to turn on/off the application. When the app is on, it will start downloading from random pages in Danbooru for good images and set them as the Phone Wallpaper for a Interval that the user can also set inside the app.

                    How To Use
                </p>
                <hr>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Put tags in bar, if you're not familiarized with Danbooru. It is an Image Board which searches in it's server using tags. Spaces don't exist in Danbooru's search system so use "+" instead: 
E.g.: long hair 1 girl = long_hair+1girl
E.g.: touhou+rating:s (rating:s will assure that you'll always get SFW posts.)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Please, take your time to get familiarized with Danbooru's search system.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Android Studio and utilizing the Danbooru API which provided me with the Data (JSON)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many... Although it was fun, I can remark the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Getting timers to work properly was kind of a hard challenge. As I would have to check that only one timer is alive at each time, to avoid errors and possible confusions by the program.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Arranging and organizing the layout using Android Studio. I think if there was a less messy way to design in Android Studio, the experience when designing the GUI would have been a lot better. Still, no regrets, pretty nice for a first release.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Creating and Updating Notification Tasks. Although it wasn't the biggest challenge. The complexity and difference of Notifications did have an impact in many approaches I wanted to take as for Notifications, still, everything went as planned.
