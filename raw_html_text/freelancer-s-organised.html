                    Everyone knows that to be make money you need more than one sources of income, hence everyone looks towards freelancing as a viable option which is very efficient as you can work at your own will and convenience but one thing which freelancing doesn't give is stable work flow. At times the work load is extreme while at other times people face unemployment hence to solve this problem we've come up with freelancer's organized which basically organizes the freelancers. The thing which inspired us to pitch this startup is our own acquaintances suffering from the same problem of unstable work flow.

                    Freelancer's Organized organizes the freelancers and approaches the employers on their behalf and provides a stable work flow for all the domains. This is very beneficial as it can evolve into something big as frequent connections with an employer can build a large network and with recommendations from the people for whom our freelancers worked can make the organization known worldwide and would be an easy stop for all the freelancers and employers. It can tackle the chronic problem of the freelancers as well as employers of searching for employers/employees and unlike the freelancing websites where the employer has to wait for a freelancer to take up a project here we would be having the freelancers ready and raring to go.

                    The primary challenge to this startup is that of revenue generation and for that the solution is to take a premium from employees and employers. An argument can be made that why would be anyone be willing to pay for something they can avail freely on a website like freelancer.com. While the argument holds true but a seasoned freelancer would avail this facility without any second thought as that little yearly premium would be a boon for him from the problem of unstable work flow and the same holds true for a regular employer while for the one time employers can avail the facility of mini payment only for one time. This would obviously beneficial for him as he'd get the employee without any time lag as in case of freelancing website

                    Definitely there might be many holes in this startup idea but it could prove revolutionary in the world of freelancing and would definitely be an idea worth trying out.

                    Freelancer's organized is born out of the idea of helping out hardworking people and therefore would definitely work out if invested in properly.
