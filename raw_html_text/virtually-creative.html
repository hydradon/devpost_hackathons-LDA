                    Virtual reality is nothing new. It has been around for over 20 years, but was considered impractical and difficult to use. It is gaining momentum today. It is still a new platform, but the market has taken off and is now growing fast. Estimates says that we will have a huge VR market by the year 2020.

                    So, how can the adveritisment market tap into this segment?

                    We, team Virtually Creative, want to show how to make use of the VR environment. We want to show how to create a platform for advertisers. The idea is to make the adverts feel native in the VR environment and give the full 3D experience to the people who are seeing, or experiencing the adverts.

                    During the Media Hackday we plan to create a virtual room. This is a lobby for people waiting to join a game. The game cannot start until a certain number of members have joined, so they will have to wait until the game can start. Some adverts will be present while they wait. Advertisers can reach their audience by placing products in this room.

                    We used the game development tool Unity 3D. This is a mature game developement platform. It was new to all of us. Only two of us have installed the environment before we came to the Media Hackday, but for the rest of the team it was totally new. This of course meant that it took a lot of time to get up and running.

                <p>
                    Given the challanges with the environment, we are really proud to be able to present the idea and the environemnt we did manange to build.

                    We learned how to use Unity 3D. We have learned a lot about virtual reality. Given the opportunity, we would really like to explore how to do real time video streaming and to play media across a number of target VR platforms.
