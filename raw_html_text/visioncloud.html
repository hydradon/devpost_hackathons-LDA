                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine yourself visiting a friend's house. You use their new soap and instantly fall in love with it and want to buy it. The problem is, however, that your friend doesn't remember the name of the brand anymore. What do you do? What can you do? And what if your friend does know the name, but doesn't know where they got it from?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This problem became the inspiration for my app. With this smartphone/tablet app, your entire world is augmented with data like never before. By using the special camera in the app, and simply pointing your device at that soap, you get back information about the product's manufacturer and you also have a way to order that good straight from the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built the app for Android. Used Google's Vision Cloud API for image recognition, WalMart API for showing the price of sleected item and CapitalOne API for purchasing the item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using Google Vision Cloud API. Before developing this hack, I had no experience how image recognition actually works.
