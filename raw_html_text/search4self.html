                <p>
                    Humans today don&rsquo;t wonder, they wonder-then-Google. As a result, the accumulation of Google searches over a period of time acts as a reliable proxy for one&rsquo;s state of mind, curiosities, ambitions, and fears included. We wanted to take a step closer towards awareness and use this data to analyse the self.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've seen that Google has
                    <strong>
                        a lot
                    </strong>
                    of data about each and everyone of us, so we decided to transform that data into something which everyone can see. Our project takes your data from Google and shows you some charts for Youtube and Google searches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AngularJS for the front-end, with Amcharts for displaying the data. The backend is powered by ASP.NET and some of the data computation is done in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing the C# and Python code together was a bit tricky, but we decided to do it so to maximize the potential of every team member.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually finishing something, after lots of bad ideas and brainstorming.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    More about the data stored by Google, we consolidated our teamwork and toned our coding skills.
