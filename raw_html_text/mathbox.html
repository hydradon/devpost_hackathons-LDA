                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After experiencing how immersive and functional virtual reality(VR) has become, we started asking ourselves what we could create with VR other than just video games. We thought of what it means to manipulate 3d space and how it's built on abstract concepts of math. With new technology in VR  we now have the ability to finally express concepts of math like Linear Algebra in 3 dimensional space and time, not the on the abstract realm of 2D white boards.

                <p>
                    Our team started with explorations in vector algebra, a basic first step in 3D math.

                    Entirely in Unity on top of C#.
