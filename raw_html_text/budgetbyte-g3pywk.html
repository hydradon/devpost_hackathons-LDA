                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make it more affordable for students to receive a better education in a better environment. It is very difficult for people from Kazakhstan (group member from Kazakhstan), for example, to get education of high quality in their countries. Therefore, despite their origins, most international students want to graduate from an American university. One problem that they face is that they might struggle with finding financial resources to fund their journey to a bachelor degree.

                    BudgetByte is a free application that college students can use the access realtime currency conversion and manage their expenses for their daily lives in college. The app is targeted at international students however, it can be used for any college student. The app is designed to be sort of like a FAFSA for students and helps give them a better understanding of how to afford and manage their budget in college. It does this by using computational mathematics and simple currency conversions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the program with the intent to help college students manage and budget their finances. There is no current application that can properly monitor the dynamics of the ever-changing world currency market. Thus, making it harder for international students who are low-income to monitor and manage their financing when college billing approaches.

                    The next step is receiving customer feedback through student surveys and customers' review of the app in order to collect more information. Based on this information, we will continue to refine and polish the app in order to make it even more user-friendly and more economically feasible.
