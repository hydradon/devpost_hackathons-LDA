                    Team Torchlight is building an open-sourced tool for emergency shelter organizers, natural disaster victims, and the wider public to find help, distribute resources, and check in on the wellbeing of their loved ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mission of Torchlight is to bring transparency, assistance, and efficiency to those most affected after a catastrophic event. We allow victims to find open shelters around them, resources to be allocated to the most-in-need shelters, give peace of mind to friends and family of victims, and a way for shelters to manage their inventory and evacuees.
