                        Currently, emergency numbers are non-discriminatory-- there is 1 clogged pipeline for many diverse problems. This results in massive inefficiency despite the existence of various agencies tailored to handle citizen's specific problems. The untimely response from uninformed government agencies creates a disconnect between the citizens of the community and the local governments created to help them-- a problem our team aspired to solve.

                        We used python to develop the user's 'response classification' algorithm. A random report generator simulates the various responses the platform will receive once integrated into communities. The program records the number of responses in the correct classification and displays that information.
