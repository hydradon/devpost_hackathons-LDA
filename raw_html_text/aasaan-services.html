                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In daily life, people travel, need a different type of services, which can be required at any time. In homes, our mothers sometimes to buy from stores but aren't able to go out. In travel, if something goes wrong to your Cars or Motor Bikes, they need to be fixed. I have been into this type of situations several times. Sometimes a plumber is needed, some other type in the middle of the journey when your vehicle breaks down you need a mechanic. This application is there to solve that issue. There are also service providers, who need respectable work, which they can do on their own will, having a sense of ownership. It also needed a metric to differentiate different service providers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a platform for beneficiaries/users to get access to service providers, at any time wherever they are. To the service providers, Asaani services will be a platform where they can work respectably, earn good wages and even the women can work.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed the basic front end structure using HTML and Bootstrap library, combined with custom CSS. Then JQuery i.e. a Javascript library to make the animations or dynamic changes of the page without reloading the whole pages. I created a database ERD structure, then created a database and migrated the tables into the database. Then entered the data into the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge I've got to know here is that we need to work on it as a business model as well. As the Asaani services need to be sustainable and someone should own it. We can work on the business idea as to integrate the payment gateway through the application, and then charging a percentage of the total fee. The funding can be an upcoming challenge as I am thinking to deploy it. An idea should be tested as soon as possible, none is perfect, but giving a beta testing is really important.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was selfless hence was a feeling of contentment which is an achievement for me, I've been able to make it responsive i.e. for three devices including mobile, laptop and tablets. The integration of google maps API's to tell the basic distance etc and thinking of the overall structure and making it to a basic practical stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned how to make an application, which is properly structured, as It supports three user roles, Admin, Service Providers, and Users. I've completed the whole application from scratch to the very top. So I've learned independence as well. Knowing what to do and making it to a practical stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aasaan Services
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is going to be deployed in some days in the future. I'll be trying the beta version and see what challenges arise, as the problem is still going on even after some people claim to have a working version of this application available.
After beta testing, I'll work on the security of both users and service providers, so that the application is trustable and useable by the people. I will see the feedback of people, and then make a plan to eradicate the problems and how to fund the applications from such that the funding is sustainable. For my vision uptil now, a percentage from the user's paid money will be collected when the server needs to be updated. For now the payment is not much, so it can be handled easily.
