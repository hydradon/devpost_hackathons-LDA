                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have not encountered any resources online that allow high school calculus students to practice in a timed environment, so I made this site to accomplish this purpose. In addition, I enjoy helping others in general and this website will certainly assist these students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two guides on fundamental integration rules and Taylor power series in case students need a quick refresher. Then they can take a shot at one section of the 2016 AP BC Calculus Exam Free Response. In the future, students will have multiple free responses to choose from for practice as well as various interactive features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I planned the basic framework of the app, deciding how to orientate the buttons and other elements. I designed the free response page by pasting images of each question and including an input field for the student's answer below each question. I placed a "Check Solutions" button at the bottom of this page for the student to use after he or she has completed the free response or if 30 minutes are up. I designed a countdown timer to place the student in a testing environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One flaw that I knew my app would run into was students checking the solutions to the problems before attempting them theirselves firsthand. I attempted to resolve this issue by first disabling the "check solutions" button and only enabling it after all the answer fields were filled in. However, not only did this idea not prevail but the students can also fill each field with some random input and then check the solutions. My second idea around this issue was ensuring that each field had to be filled out (i.e. placing the 'required' attribute onto the 'input' tag) before submitting. However, when the "check solutions" button was clicked, the input field displayed the warning but the solutions were posted, which was not what I intended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am satisfied with designing a basic template for additional free responses that will be placed on the website and providing a page for at least an audience of students who are diligent enough to work through all parts of the free response questions carefully before checking the solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the difficulties that one can face when creating a website similar to mine, such as ensuring that all problems are completed for solutions are revealed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calculus Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will include more free response practices in addition to multiple choice problems. Furthermore, I will find solutions to the aforementioned issues I ran into and include additional interactive features to create a more enjoyable learning experience for students.
