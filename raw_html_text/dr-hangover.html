                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realised people our age are sometimes a little bit irresponsible when it comes to
                    <strong>
                        alcohol
                    </strong>
                    consumption and
                    <strong>
                        nightlife
                    </strong>
                    in general. We decided that we could build a virtual assistant that would help them recover when they feel sick. It also tries to make people acknowledge their acts (mainly when they wouldn't recall most of them).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It records people's
                    <strong>
                        locations
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        thoughts
                    </strong>
                    during a night out, in order to show it to them the morning after, while helping them wake up and establishing their physical well-being level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started working with
                    <em>
                        Dialogflow
                    </em>
                    for our
                    <em>
                        Natural Language Processing
                    </em>
                    needs, writing in
                    <em>
                        Javascript
                    </em>
                    in order to make intents better. We then set up a
                    <em>
                        Firebase real time Database
                    </em>
                    to record all the data we needed to make
                    <em>

                    </em>
                    work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript, mainly. It does strange things we don't understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We almost managed to make it work! (Although
                    <em>
                        JavaScript
                    </em>
                    is even worse than what we thought).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of things about
                    <em>
                        voice assistants
                    </em>
                    . We had never coded in
                    <em>
                        JavaScript
                    </em>
                    before. We were pretty much newbies in this world and we have learned way more than what we expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dr. Hangover
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a more complex system, with some API integrations. Using
                    <em>
                        Machine Learning
                    </em>
                    to make it work more accurately based on its experience with all of its users.
