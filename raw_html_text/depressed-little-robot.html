                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hate pets but a lot of people like pets.  I find them kind of pointless because they just wander around aimlessly and do a wee on the carpet every once in a while.  I think people like pets because watching them be helpless and pathetic makes them feel way better about their miserable lives.  This is like a pet, but doesn't cost an insane amount in vet bills, you don't have to feed it, and it doesn't even wee where it shouldn't.  (Yet.  Stay tuned for version 2.0)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly just sits there.  Occasionally wanders forward and backward a bit.  Tries to end its life by slamming into walls or barrelling off the edge of a table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an Arduino, some motors, and designed some motor drivers to manage the functionality and a couple of switches as sensors.  The frame is made of K'Nex 'cause I knew I was going to fuck it up a bunch of times and laser cutting lots of different frames would have been wasteful.  Also K'Nex comes with wheels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It wasn't misbehaving the way I programmed it to due to voltage spikes and noise from the motor.  I ripped it apart and soldered in a capacitor to filter a lot of the noise out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finished half the bottle of vodka.  I didn't cry in front of too many other hackers because not many people showed up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering iron burns: 0
Robot burns: 6
Why did I waste my time on this?
                </p>

                    What's next for Depressed Little Robot

                <p>
                    When encountering a wall, it should repeatedly slam itself against the wall a few times in desperation before giving up and slowly wandering away.
