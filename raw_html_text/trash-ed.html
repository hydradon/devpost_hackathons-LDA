                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Standing in front of the trash bin for few minutes standing with empty cups and used packets, trying to figure out which bin to use out of the three.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trash-Ed scans the trash image and predicts which bin the trash should be disposed off, to help the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android application that used google vision api. We trained our model that segregates trash into different categories using dataset of approximate 4k images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google authorization for autoML has been a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successful in training our dataset using 4k images with adequate accuracy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt the how the google vision autoML works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trash-Ed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Geo-tagged bins to get the nearest location of the trash bin
-Object detection of each trash object with details.
-Add a device on dustbin that senses the image and predicts which bin to use.
