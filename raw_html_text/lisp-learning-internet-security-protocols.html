                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this hack for a crucial reason. We now live in an era where computer technology is now present. There are so many things that can be done with computer technology, for both good and bad reasons. Yes, bad things can happen on the internet, and one of them involves unethical hacking, which involves the intruder, also known as the hacker, making numerous attempts to break into a person&rsquo;s or business&rsquo; sensitive information stored on the internet through the use of a computer. Hackers have the power to make attempts to break into just about anything stored on the internet for their personal gain, and especially in an era of computer technology, it&rsquo;s becoming an increasing trend that very few individuals seem to be aware of. There are also times when a user of technology will perform such tasks on the internet without even realizing where the situation may go, leading to the hacker having the mission of getting all information become a success.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack is made to educate any user of technology the basic concepts of cybersecurity, as well as implementing a simulation, also known as an interactive experience, to allow the user to experience the feeling of becoming a victim of an unexpected cyberattack.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Adobe Photoshop and an open code source editor called Brackets to develop the website and to implement images that have been edited into the website. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were the three languages used for this project.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technical challenges we came across were the development of both the interactive experience and the educational website.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to implement my knowledge of cybersecurity and web development into a website project during a hackathon event.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that constructing the website requires critical thinking on how to inform the audience on a particular and important subject. We collaborated on the progress being made and other parts that needed to be added to the project.

                <p>
                    We feel that our major improvement would be the design of the website, as it should stand out a little more to the audience.
