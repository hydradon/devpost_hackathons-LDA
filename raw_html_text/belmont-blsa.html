                <h2>
                    Summarize your idea/solution?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proposing an app that would function much like Tinder, but it would be for minority law students and lawyers to network and seek/offer mentorship. It would be in conjunction with the Tennessee Alliance for Black Lawyers, so people who join this bar association would have access to the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Describe your idea and how it addresses the challenge?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's great about this is that it addresses access to justice on a higher level by addressing the issue of the lack of diversity in the legal field. So many people/entities would be better served or would feel more comfortable with diverse attorneys but cannot find any because the law is one of the least diverse professions in the country. Additionally, the diverse law students and attorneys that do exist are not always privy to all of the opportunities that lead to success. This idea also eliminates the problem students often have of getting mentors at school that are not the best fit and/or never contribute to the mentorship relationship. By joining TABL and signing up for this app, people are interested and committed to networking and/or mentoring others
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How would your idea serve a local community?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would help law students by giving them access to legal professionals that may be in the positions the students are interested in. Additionally, it is expected that relationships would form through this app, so it isn't as awkward and random as a cold linkedin request and message. Furthermore, the people who are already lawyers would benefit because they could talk to other lawyers in the state who may be working on something they could collaborate on. There is also the possibility that the networking aspect could lead to referrals between the lawyers. By giving these opportunities to minorities, it would contribute to the success of diverse law students and lawyers and increase the community's access to lawyers that look and think like them and understand their situations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Who will use the solution?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This would be an app for law students, lawyers, and potentially even students that are interested in or starting law school. That way, it creates a pipeline to success beginning before the people's law school journey even begins. Law students could also serve as mentors to the interested people who want help with applications, LSAT tips, and what to expect in law school.

                <h2>
                    What makes your solution unique, innovative, and impactful?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As far as we know, this isn't something that is available and would be a new way to find mentors and networking opportunities that align with people's interests and unique perspectives. TABL (our sponsoring organization's) events could be available in the app and people could decide to plan to meet in person at these events. Many ideas try to make the law more accessible in general, but there are not many ideas that are aiming for more diversity that would ultimately increase people's access to justice.
