                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a solution set that enables various examples of peer-to-peer networks in a smart city. The examples we have focused on are solar energy credits based on a homes excess output, charging station communication between autonomous vehicles, and battery providence and usage history.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Hyperledger Fabric Composer and Hyperledger v1.0 on IBM Bluemix.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Salesfore to interact with the applications and manage all of the network participants, assets, and transactions. Create more examples of Smart City applications across a variety of verticals. Using Datasets and Machine Learning libraries to save energy, reduce polution, and create efficiencies in the city.
