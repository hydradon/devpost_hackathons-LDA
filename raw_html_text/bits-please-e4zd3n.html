                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that there is already an IoT infrastructure in the major cities that is currently underused. Most of them are generating high amounts of contamination every day that are harmful to the citizens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CityManager monitors and controls the main sources of contamination to reduce them and get cleaner cities. Also, the citizen could be aware of the condition of different areas and actively participate in the process of making a cleaner city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have different components using different technologies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Arduino deployment connected to a raspberry-pi that has a python server using rest and coap for communicating.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cloud service running in python (connected to the raspberry-pi using coap), offering a rest api for the mobile app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The mobile app is using Flutter. It connects to google maps and to our cloud service.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our project is covering different areas. We ran into two challenges: Nokia challenge and Ericsson challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the prototype that we built and in the product idea that we got. We think that a product with these features could be really beneficial to our society and future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the technologies that we are using. Most of us didn't have experience with some or most of these technologies before the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bits please
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Validate the idea and the prototype and check if there is an interest and a real necessity in our project.
