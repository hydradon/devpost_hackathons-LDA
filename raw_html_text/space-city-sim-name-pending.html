                    Inspiration - Went into GSUHack with a single idea: I want to build a video game. After an hour of brainstorming, I decided on a Simcity-like game but in space. So, I marched relentlessly to see how far I can go.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - The original idea is to be a multiplayer game with a free-market economy system that takes advantage of Amazon's Web Services.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - I used Amazon's Lumberyard to help put down the foundation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Oh boy, tighten your seat belts for this one. Originally, I was in a team of four and I pitched the idea for a video game. They didn't seem to mind the idea, so we went with it. At 8 PM, Friday, I found that they all left and a day later found that they weren't coming back. I pursued the idea regardless, and eventually settled on the idea of a Space City Sim Game. Going into it, I have only the knowledge of Java for programming languages. I have very sparsely touched a game engine, let alone Amazon's, so I spent the first night and second day going over tutorials. The second night was met with my laptop's utter refusal to install VS C++ Redists below 2008. So, I had to make a workaround to continue. I worked through each night, with a grand total of 105 minutes of sleep (very efficient sleep, mind you.) and eventually managed to get as far as I did. The last hurtle, is trying to figure out how to compile the sources and getting the software to do so before the deadline (that is now.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Learning how to use a game engine by myself, and getting the groundwork done for my own game in about 3 days. The fact that I did it solo really makes me happy that I kept going through the nights without sleep (and occasionally food).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - Don't lose hope. Find a meaning for the things you do. It's not always about the prizes and competition, the point is to have fun, become a better engineer, and make something you're proud of. (Technically, I kinda knew that coming in, but this experience solidifies that thought, and I hope other hackers can learn from this as well.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space City Sim (Name Pending) - It's very unfinished, and unpolished, and there's so many things to do just to get it to being even playable. I have to finish implementing the UI, menu, music/sounds, economy system, buildings, multiplayer support, AI, etc, etc.
