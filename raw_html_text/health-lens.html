                <p>
                    Health Lens prompts the user for some personal information to create a profile on the individual's daily true nutritional requirements. This is then compared to the true nutritional information of a food item to express it as a percent of the person's daily requirement.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    initially the nutritional information was going to be discovered via Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read a nutritional label. because of limitations with the OCR's accuracy we had to scrap the idea and move on to a more practical solution. in our case this meant using the Nutritionix database.

                    How it was made
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through hard work and much trial and error, the web app was created using a mix of JS, html, and CSS, with the addition of the Nutritionix API we were able to access a large database of information for our project.
