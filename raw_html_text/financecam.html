                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our inexperience in the world of investments, and wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for the uninitiated (like us) to make sound investment decisions by summarizing the financial information we have available in a short and easy-to-read format.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    The user has multiple options to choose a company, and all of them are simple and intuitive. The three options are:

                        Text detection using a camera
One a company has been chosen, the app interfaces with our server in order to process the company name, find a unique Ticker to identify the company if it exists in the database, and return financial information about the company.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed it from the top down, gradually turning an idea into reality, with a lot of teamwork and communication. We started by building an android app and connecting it with Firebase to take advantage of machine learning for image identification. We added speech-to-text for accessibility, while simultaneously working on a communication protocol between the app and our server, and the server with external APIs. The data is returned to the user and rendered in an html page for easy scaling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of our planning stage, we decided to use the Google Vision API for our app, but we ended up having a lot of trouble getting the interface set up. We chose Firebase as an alternative because the integration with Android was much easier. We had never used python servers before, so another challenge was to learn how to write the web server as we were going, and to make sure that each successive iteration of the code maintained compatibility and functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to take our original idea and bring it to fruition, without sacrificing functionality or quality. We are also proud of our team communication and the way we were able to divide the work efficiently while making sure everybody was up-to-date on the whole project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a very multi-faceted project, and we learned a lot about integrating multiple languages and communication protocols in a short amount of time. Every single one of us is now capable of doing something that we had no previous experience with, and we are more confident in our problem-solving and team design decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FinanceCam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We strive to bring more useful information to the user, and include more data intelligence and useful statistics. We want to continue to implement more non-trivial methods of statistical analysis in order to provide useful recommendations, and we want to add more customizability to the user side of things, so that user have more control and are able to choose what data is useful to them. We also want to expand out of the Android market into other phone markets and other devices, including support for a fully-functioning web application.
