                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people to understand the harm done daily to digital frogs, their habitats, and their families. Some incredibly pressing issues include digital dissections, ecosystem modeling, pocket frog abandonment, car crashing and racing, and exploitation of their economy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Digital Frog Protection Agency allows for digital frogs to find safety in their sanctuary.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website using the MLH lesson plan and helped save digital frogs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We previously didn't know how to code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a website, fiddled around with an Arduino Uno, and learned about Google Cloud AutoML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some basic HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                    What's next for Digital Frog Protection Agency
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create a sensor for activists to use to identify digital frogs more easily.
