                    The daily grind of the current high school and college schedules, while seeming mundane, actually affects the mental health of a large portion of the population.  Rates of anxiety have risen drastically among populations of teenagers which can have crippling effects. One initial cause of anxiety is the inability to start on a mountain of tasks.

                    is a smart calendar app that prioritizes your tasks, homework, events, and exams, so that you do not have to. The user puts in their class/work schedule, mandatory tasks, etc and the app prioritizes and populates a calendar with the optimal time-table, with the option of exporting to GoogleCalendar.

                    Our team used HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap formatting to program the webpage for the UI and python for the backend data-management. The team also using Django to integrate python into the running of the HTML file.

                    One of the biggest challenges was interfacing with the various API's and connecting the python back-end to the front-end.

                    Two of our members had done little-to-no web-programming and were able to build this website from scratch. Another group member was excited that they now know how to work with Django.

                    is to implement a web crawler that would gather automatically much of the information that is inputted manually as of now. This would free up even more time for the user to focus on the tasks at hand instead of wasting time adding new tasks. The web crawler would also make it easier to maintain repeating events such as work and class schedules.
