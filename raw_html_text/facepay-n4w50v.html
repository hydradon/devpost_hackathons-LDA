                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, sometime around the year 2018, there were lots of payment systems that just about everybody used but nobody comprehended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start with the primary tool: Cash. Cash is definitely one of the oldest payment systems. It is reliable for small scale services and for everyday spending. But, it is hard to scale. If you are trying to buy several hundred dollars worth of goods, you don't want to physically go to your wallet and count the number of bills you have. Definitely not worth my time. Also, carrying around a lot of cash in your wallet is not the best idea in the world; muggers and robbers can definitely take advantage of you.

                <p>
                    Credit cards, while more scalable than cash, also have a lot of questions that have yet to be answered. How do I know which way the credit card goes? Is it the swipe or the chip? And what do I do if my card gets declined? Most importantly, what do I do if someone who's not as well-intentioned as I am is able to gain access to my credit card number? I'd have to go through the whole ordeal of calling the CC company, cancelling the card, and ordering a new one. I also don't have time for that.

                    Step in FacePay. FacePay uses sophisticated image recognition to complete financial transactions. It allows a user to "check-out" items by simply taking a picture of the items in the user's hand. It then parses the text on the user's items to determine what these items are, allowing a receipt to be created. Next, it takes a picture of the user's face. It searches through the database of many unique, identifiable faces and locates the Name and Balance associated with that face.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FacePay brings financial payments to the 21st century by solving all of these problems. All your financial information is stored in a secure system using . With over 6 billion people in this world with different faces, it is no doubt that FacePay is one of the safest, most secure ways to pay for goods and services.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build our application from the ground up. To help us get access to facial detection technology, as well as searching capabilities and object recognition, we implemented our code using features from Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Walmart Open API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges was trying to get the APIs to work. We were new to Microsoft's Azure platform, so we needed to get assistance from the helpful staff at the Microsoft booth to get our Cognitive Services and Storage Explorer features working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're simply proud of FacePay and the final product. We couldn't have imagined building something any more ambitious than this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than all the APIs we had to use to connect individuals with businesses, one of the major things we learned was about each other. See, before this hackathon, we didn't know each other very well. We came from the same major at the same school, but we unfortunately were in different classes. By spending a whole weekend together, four USC Computer Engineering and Computer Science majors got to know each other a whole lot better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FacePay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FacePay is definitely something we will continue to develop in our own free time. One of the most important things we care about in financial transactions is security. We think that having a two-factor authorization would work well for luxury items: Facial recognition and fingerprint scanning. Other ideas include perfecting the user experience and actually building a model that stores and other businesses could use.
