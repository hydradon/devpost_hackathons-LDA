                    What it does: Basically the same thing as the GUH website, but retro
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: With html, css, javascript, tears and patience
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: At some point the website homepage got completely ruined after hitting reload, although no changes were made to the code. That was something.
