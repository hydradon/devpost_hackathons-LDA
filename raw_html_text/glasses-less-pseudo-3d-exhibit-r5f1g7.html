                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A VR headset can be an expensive, messy, hard to maintain function of ones work or personal interests.  We were inspired to find a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an intuitive 3-D interactive environment, without the VR hassle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software projection maps an environment to the screen based off the perspective of a user.  If a user is looking straight at a cube and walks right, the simulation will 'move' as well exposing the right side of the cube, simulating perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users hands (and feet) are tracked and rendered onto the screen, allowing the user to press buttons, hit beach balls, and more.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Extrapolation
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The project as a whole is a collection of useful assets and demos to create your own applications. Potential use cases for this product include digital signage, education, and a lot more. It is very easy to get up and running with the code that we provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, this project could be used for eye catching advertisements. As you pass by a TV on the wall, it acts as a virtual display case. This could also be implemented as a game, allowing users to hack and slash their way through a hoard of beach balls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Microsoft Kinect V2, and a simulated environment in Unity, the program finds the best suited human and begins to track them.  The tracking relies on the Kinect API at a low level, but the "3-D" abilities of this program come from code written in C# by us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calibrating the FOV and camera settings was the worst challenge. It was also difficult to time the beats correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works amazingly well for being made in one weekend, and the 3D effect is much more convincing than we were expecting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hogan learned a lot about the Unity engine as a whole, especially about 3D modeling, animation, and effects that can be applied.  He also learned to use C# for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matthew was re-familiarized with Unity after a long break and probably wrote better c# than 90% of the c# he has written in the past. He got do deal with a lot of super fun bugs in the Unity Linux beta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Caleb learned about projection mapping and the Kinect API, and that it is definitely possible to sleep on cement if you are tired enough.
                </p>

                    What's next for Headset-free Pseudo 3-D Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This technology could be used in digital signage, education, and other interesting applications. The code is all open-source, so it is now up to the community to see what they come up with.
