                    At present, Quality check of the calls at Contact Centers are being done manually. Due to the enormity, all the calls cannot be assessed for the quality and random samples are picked and analyzed.  Availability of a solution which could automatically give insights into customer sentiments of every call and which could be tailor-made for any domain would be great.
