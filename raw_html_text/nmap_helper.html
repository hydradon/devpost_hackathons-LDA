                    Nmap is a network scanning tool used by security researchers and professionals, but its output is often verbose and difficult to parse for someone who has never seen it before. We aim to use IBM Watson's conversation chatbot tool to make understanding nmap more intuitive and user friendly. This tool is ideal for IT professionals for troubleshooting, as well as an educational stepping stone as a first interaction to network scanning.  Watson can interpret data from network and system scans in order to recommend appropriate patching and remediation measures.
