                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From time to time I would try to tell Alexa that I see stressed or happy. All I would hear back is "Sorry, I don't know that one".  So I started to look online at twitter and other social networks and saw that a lot of people share their feelings there but never get any replies. That is when I decided to make an alexa skill called My Support Circle where you can share how you are feeling.  Next I wanted to add in a way where people could create a support network and show support for their friends but controlled way where you as still anonymous but can show your support with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just say "Alexa, tell My Support Circle I feel empowered today" or "Alexa, tell My Support Circle I feel achy today".  My Support Circle will record how you feel and let you know if any of your friend need your support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Support Circle will also let you know if your friends need your support today. 
"Alexa, ask My Support Circle how my friends feel today".
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Support Circle allows you to support one another in an anonymous and controlled way.  "2 of your friends need you support today, do you want to show them your support?". My Support Circle is a positive support group for your feelings.  Show your support for friends who are feeling bad or you can be happy for friends that are feeling good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll also get support from your friends. Simply share your Code with friends to add them to your support circle. "Alexa, ask My Support Circle what is my code?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or to add a friend to your support circle say "Alexa, tell My Support Circle to add friend with Code 6782162"
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Support Circle promotes the use of having a large support circle who care about one another and show their support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built My Support Circle using node.js, amazon llamdba, and dynamoDB
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to allow users to use My Support Circle without creating an account but yet have them grow a support group of friends. I created the idea of sharing codes that are associated with the echo enabled device they are using rather than an email and password.  This keeps the service more private and less intrusive feeling.  People will be more likely to share their feelings if they know their email address or other personal information isn't stored with their feelings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Support Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Support Circle is ready to be shared with users. I just can't wait to get feedback from users and see how they like it.
