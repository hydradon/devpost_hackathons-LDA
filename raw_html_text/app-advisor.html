                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I and Gin are first-year students still trying to choose our classes. We thought it would be nice to have a web page that helps students like us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides students information about recommended classes and TA hours according to majors and class years they choose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Javascript and HTML to design web pages that allow students to choose their majors and link it to another page where students can select their class years.
                </p>
