                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prominence of the Corona Virus in social media, as well as the spread of misinformation concerning the topic, lead our team to develop a web app that serves to dispell miscommunication regarding common diseases around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ViralConnection is a web app that features a variety of interactable visual aids to help viewers gain information on common diseases within their countries. In ViralConnection, users are able to look at a country and find the symptoms and preventative measures associated with a variety of infectious diseases around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly utilized Eclipse Windowbuilder which is based in Java to construct the GUIs and visual aspects of our program. Using different classes and visibility methods made linking the pages of the program smooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first hackathon, managing time for various tasks was a challenge. The unavoidable repetitiveness of certain aspects of the project became very irritable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design of the program itself looks far better than our previous projects. With a variety of colours and layouts, the user interface is appealing and easy to use. Creating our own logo for the program was a nice touch as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building a project, starting off with a simple idea and expanding upon it at a later interval will bear greater fruit than being scared too scared to begin your project at all. All ideas must start from somewhere!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ViralConnection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate a database with the program and have visual cues concerning the number of cases of a certain reported virus found in each country. We would like to eventually add a real-time tracker detailing the increases and decreases in the number of cases per country.
