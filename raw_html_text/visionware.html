                    This is unique application that intends to help people with vision impedance to find items in the room.

                    Idea
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Idea is that user should be able to find exact location of the requested item from Voice assistant. 
User should also get brief feedback of what items are nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phone/tablet scans the room while user holds device. Ideally I think users will have attached device on chest for full experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User can ask for specific item:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        User:
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        "Please find me my laptop"
                    </em>
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Assistant
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        "I found one laptop nearby, it's in 2 meters left from you."
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    if there are multiple items in the room answer will be following
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Assistant
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        "I found five laptops nearby, the nearest one is in 2 meters left from you."
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    User can ask for nearby items:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        "What items are nearby?"
                    </em>
                    <br>
                    <strong>

                        "There are 5 laptops, 3 chairs, 2 tables and 10 more different items near you."

                <h3>
                    How it's done?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I used new
                    <a href="https://get.google.com/tango/" rel="nofollow">
                        Google Project-Tango
                    </a>
                    that enables device to scan the room and localize later in the same room to the exact coordinate system. 
I also used
                    <a href="https://www.clarifai.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        clarifai
                    </a>
                    API for labeling items in the room. 
The mixture of those apis (and couple of more Android libraries) is VisionWare :)
