                    Konexio is a Paris based organization that seeks to facilitate refugee integration through coding and digital training. More than 100 refugee students are encouraged to go through our program. It is funded by France Government to support empowerment of refugees lives. Our vision is to create a best design web application platform for mentor-student matching and come up with solution to tackle this problem.

                    How we built it
We built Angular JS using MVC architecture (model - controller - view) which lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop. AngularJS is a java framework tools for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.

                    Challenges we ran into
We are trying to come up with better efficient stable matching algorithm other than time complexity of O(n square). We got different issue during discussion.

                    Accomplishment  that we have proud of 
We added feature : ChatBot, 
We accomplished implementing in Angular JS in first attempt and deploying it on web server.

                    What have we learned
We need to practice coding in web application and come up with efficient solution
