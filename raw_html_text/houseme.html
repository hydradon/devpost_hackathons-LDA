                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every single Berkeley student knows that finding housing near campus is one of the most stressful experiences of their lives. (Yes, even more than school sometimes.) We just wanted to make an app that would make the process less difficult. Currently there isn't a good consolidated listing of living spaces. We either have to look through Cragslist or call landlords directly. It's also difficult because we have to consider SO many factors like: price, number of people, and location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes the house search less stressful!
It provides a platform for sellers to easily upload pictures and info about the places they're renting out. 
For general home-seeking population, all the locations are displayed on a map with thumbnails that allow them to easily see info about the place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the app using Swift and Firebase. 
Also implemented the Google APIs and SDKs for maps and places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Firebase to work properly
Learning Swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we didn't get to everything we wanted. Neither of us were familiar with Swift or Firebase coming in, so it's honestly just quite amazing to see what we could build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SOO much. 
How to use swift. (Creating storyboards and views, creating segues, the language)
and the GoogleMaps SDK (displaying maps, getting locations, placing pins)
and Firebase (setup, adding to the database and storage)
                </p>

                    What's next for HouseMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal is to give the user abilities to filter what listings they see. Most students looking have very specific details like price ranges, number of roommates, and location in mind. It would be SUPER super helpful if there was something that could do that for us.
