                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Discovering opportunities with smaller organizations is needlessly difficult 
-Some organizations have specific needs and might need to be selective in choosing volunteers
-No reliable platform exists for private citizens in need to seek volunteers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Connects those seeking volunteer opportunities with those offering them in an easily swipeable format
-Servable&hellip; Log in. Swipe Right. Volunteer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Order of events: developed idea &gt; db structure &gt; built home page &gt; connected to database &gt; built out features
-Using sqllite database and a react.js (a javascript library for building user interfaces). 
-Alexis Carr was the primary programmer who built most of the front-end and back-end. She is a catch for those looking to hire developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Building an app in 24 hours is almost impossible
-Most of us did not have experience with web development
-Lost 3 team members, but that's ok
-Unable to build out all desired features during hackathon, but that's ok
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We learned a lot about React.js
-Building out triggered events using swiping functionality is hard
-We are a good team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Alexis is the bomb
-Some people don't have what it takes to make it until the end
-There is a need for this service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Servable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Build out the remaining features (ratings, chat, leaderboard, event/time tracking for reporting)
-Sell the idea
                </p>
