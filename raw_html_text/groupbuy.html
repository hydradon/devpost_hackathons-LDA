                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the field of using bots to purchase items through Facebook, Slack, and Skype. Buying items for cheap through the click of a button was what made us build this fantastic application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created both a web app and a bot that offers a company platform to sell various items in bulk through our web application which reaches its client base through the bot on Facebook, Slack and Skype. The key to selling products for cheaper is always buying in bulk. Through the far reaching platforms like Facebook we can gain a client base of those platforms. The web application works by registering your company, and posting products for sale. Every product will have a minimum number of purchases and the products will not be sold until the minimum number of purchasers is reached. This is where the consumers come in. Instead of a single consumer buying in bulk, we have many consumers buying in bulk, therefore allowing for cheaper prices for everyone without having to buy in bulk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We matched our skills and split into teams. One team worked on the actual bot, putting together the functionality and the graphics. The other team worked on the web application, creating a slick website for companies to reach their consumers. The bots and the website was then linked together by a database using Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the process we ran into some small debugging problems with the web application, the bot and the database. These were all fairly easy to debug, and didn't put too much of a dent in our time limit.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the accomplishment of finishing our app for the most part. We split up the work and each person was able to contribute.

                    All of us learned a great deal of teamwork and mastered the languages they worked in
