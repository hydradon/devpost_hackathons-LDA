                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A conversation about tweets fighting one another. This turned into subreddits. It slowly evoloved into subreddits playing the fighting game themselves. Perhaps even as Pokemon trainers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parses a subreddit and uses the text from that subreddit to control an emulated Pokemon Red.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Node.js to run some straightforward shell commands while running an emulator in the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    xdotools (the keyboard simulator used to control the emulator) is slow. Node.js, while not blindingly fast, is pretty speedy. Long story short, I had to slow my program down to about the time it takes to run a gameboy command. After that, it was a cinch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easy parsing of reddit. 
See above about the hellish xdotools mess. I figured it out. It took two hours and about nine characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about node.js. I'd never actually coded in it before this. A lot about emulators, xdotools, windows, and the like as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for TwitchPlaysPokemonPlaysPokemon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to pit subreddits against each other for the fastest time to completion.
