                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to get out of college during our breaks and explore what Houston and other cities have to offer. While Tripadvisor and Yelp were always options, they lacked a way of grouping our interests and merging them into one compiled list. This is what led to the creation of Your Ideal Trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website generates a list off activities based off your interests by allowing you to check everything you are interested and what city you are in. It then generates a list of cool activities to and an itinerary of what to do within the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on rails, Yelp API, Google  Maps API and HTML and CSS were all used to develop this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a major challenge of getting the Oauth to work on the APIs for both Google and Yelp. At the same time on the front-end many of us encountered problems with learning how HTML and CSS function. Overall, though we are very proud of what we have accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have created a working product that emerged from a learning experience for many of our members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team and learn things on the fly. I think all us emerged as better problem solvers and critical thinkers through the time we have spent on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Your Ideal Trip:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like it create more detailed trip itineraries, that are more personalized for the user. We would also like to be able to monetize the app and be able to find current location all on its own. We would also like to become less API dependent upon Google Maps as it has a strict API quota. However, we are hopeful for the future Ideal Trip has and we think with more time this project can evolve into something truly great.
