                    Often BC students struggle and stress during their registration time because they fail to figure out which professor is the best to take, for each of their individual classes. The problem with ratemyprofessor.com currently is that, not many BC professors are listed on the website, and often, the scores are heavily biased due to each individual's own skills and intelligence. Inspired by this useful but somewhat lacking website, our group decided to tackle on the project of building our own BC version of professor rating system.

                <p>
                    This website inspires BC students to carefully lookup and analyze professor ratings before registering for their classes. After entering in a complete profile information on the website, users can see the ratings of specific professors given by other students, in addition to a personalized rating that figures out the optimal rating score based on one's profile information. This personal score along with a graphical view of other students'  ratings, this website allows BC students to lessen their registration struggles and pick the course and the professor that is right for them. We finished off the project by implementing simple and appealing UI that helps students navigate the website more easily.

                    To complete this project, we wrote our codes on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Implementing these three different programming languages together into one project allowed us to be more creative and daring with our abilities.

                    We are proud of the algorithm we have introduced to calculate the personalized score ratings. We put more emphasis on the students' year and GPA to calculate the ratings so that a rating given by a Senior with a 4.0 GPA won't be as effective to a Freshman with a 2.0 GPA.

                    Finally, we would love to continue to working on this project by creating a database system that would allow us to extend the list of professors for each major and schools. In addition, we intend to further publish and share our works with others so that more students can participate in giving recommendations to other students based on their preferences and information.
