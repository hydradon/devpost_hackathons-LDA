                    Dev Process

                <p>
                    It's unclear whether our inspiration was Tom Scott, Silicon Valley, or Black Mirror. In any case not really knowing each-other our team were all wondering how we could talk to anyone else. The WiFi was too slow to talk to our friends. Why not simulate them?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It quickly became apparent that you can just download your data from facebook. The issue with using this data is that there was a lot of useless data stored that would be too much effort to handle like emojis, files, photos, audio, and stickers.
The other problem is that it may include multiple people which would break our planned modelling of conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually we settled on concatenating subsequent messages from the same conversational participant, keeping the would be human's messages as inputs and the would be robot's as outputs. This was used as our training data. Initially we could only train on one set of messages, leading to our initial chatbots only being trained on datasets of roughly 100 input-response pairs. As of the latest update we now recursively parse through the entire directory of messages that the user uploads. On a years worth of my messages this resulted in over 10000 input-response pairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We train the data using supervised learning algorithms, in particular using shallow learning with word2vec models. Word2vec are two layer neural networks designed to understand linguistic contexts of languages. We process the data concurrently to optimise the time it takes to train our model, and train our machine learning model by updating the weightings of the neural network with word2vec models.  When a response from our model is needed, we simply retrieve the most relevant response from our model. This means that when we are given a new input we assess its context, and map this context to an output context. We then select responses that are closest to this output context. Obviously this is somewhat artificial as we can only send messages that have been sent before, and also we only respond to the message immediately previous to the response. That said, this was the first time any of us had used any ML so we are pretty happy with this as a first pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to create a user-interface that looks like a chatting platform, we decided to go for the simplest approach, which is to use the RecyclerView layout combined with Linear layout. The RecyclerView is used to display messages sent and received in the order they are added to the messages list and the Linear layout contains the input chatbox and send message button. After the user enter a message and press the send message button, we simply add the message to the messages list and display it. Then, we post a request to the server and get the message response, which we also add to the messages list and display in the RecyclerView. We also enabled auto scrolling, so the RecyclerView always scrolls to the latest message received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Docker to push our application to the Azure Container Registry and we deployed these containers to Azure App Service. This was a quick and easy process and could result in high availability and auto scaling for our backend service.

                    To create the interface of your texting profile, we'll ask you to download your messaging history. We then process and clean up this data in Kotlin, and pass this as a JSON file to Python. We then use machine learning algorithms on this data to 'intelligently' build a model that represents you!

                    Our front-end was written in Android Studio featuring sleek chatbot design. todo:
Once we're set up, you can now talk to our bot! This query is sent via HTTP get methods, to our Kotlin interface that retrieves the most relevant response from our model in Python through Flask.

                    We initially had problems with attempting to an external Python script in Kotlin, however after attempting for way too long to use Kotlin/Java process implementations we just w/e and used flask todo:
