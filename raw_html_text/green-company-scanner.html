                    Inspiration - How hard it can be to find how environmentally friendly any company you buy products are. So the goal is to make it easier for people to be able to buy more ethically.

                <h2>
                    What it does - Our broad idea was to have a barcode scanner that returned feedback on how green a company was. However, being a team of, effectively, complete beginners to any coding, we only made a small step on that path. Our program simply uses a computer's connected webcam to read a presented barcode and store it in an excel file in the same folder.

                    How we built it - Solely python, using imutils and cv2
                </h2>
