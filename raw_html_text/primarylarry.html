                    </em>
                    sources of news media proved themselves to be crucial in understanding real time events both by journalists and ordinary people. Twitter is advertised as "a place to create and share ideas and information" to potentially millions upon millions of users, and is frequently used by regular people at ground zero to disperse live updates about important events happening near them. In PrimaryLarry, we aspire to organize and make useful thousands of distributed tweets a second, by analyzing live streams of tweets from localities of significance. With our proprietary algorithm, we take into consideration various factors such as event proximity, tweet readability and relevance, and content quality to provide useful insights with first-person perspectives.

                        The readability of a tweet is hard to determine. Most modern readability measurements are for long English texts, whereas a tweet is a 140-character message filled with lack of punctuation, misspellings, leet-speak, hashtags, and URL's -- this proved troublesome as readability measurements are determined by metrics such as the number of characters, words, sentences, syllables, or even the number of words with polysyllables. We attempted to mitigate this issue by analyzing a parsed version of the tweet without hashtags or URL's.
