                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simpler way to organize and store receipts to make the lives of customers a lot more streamlined and stress-free. Carrying around hundreds of paper receipts can be a mess and the potential to lose receipts presents a great risk for customers. By using our database, a user can rest at peace knowing that they can look at any receipts from any store at any time they wish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this product using the Google Cloud Vision API which allows our program to detect if an image is a receipt and then detect the text within the receipt. We used Python to code the bulk of our code and create the databases we needed to store everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with integrating the API with our code at first and we ran into multiple problems with creating databases to store our data. We also struggled with making our code work with Java inside the Eclipse IDE. We ended up switching to Python within Spyder and learning how to code in Python on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're extremely proud of our program having the ability to store multiple receipts into a database that the user can access at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of organizing our data and we discovered how to use the different Google Cloud APIs within programs to create powerful products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for E-Stash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to create a front-end interface that the user can interact with to make the product a lot easier to use. This front-end interface would have a welcome screen and a search bar that allows the user to enter what store they wish to access a receipt from. We also want to store the expiration date of every receipt and store the date every receipt was printed and organize our data accordingly. After choosing the store, the user would be presented with a list of every receipt from that store listed from the most current reciepts to the least recent. There would be another button that allows the user to view an archive of expired receipts from that store.
