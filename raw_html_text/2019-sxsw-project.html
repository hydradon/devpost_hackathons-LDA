                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live music, live art, live performances, live dancers in front of projected live digital art. These experiences are the cornerstone for building an ecosystem which catalyzes a new secondary market for digital live media. Our inspiration is to create value for venue owners, management companies, and the artists themselves. We are inspired to reduce costs and create efficient processes. We are inspired to enable someone like the bar owner in Freetown, Sierra Leone to be able to book live music which can increase business. Mobile penetration is high enough to where our services can be beneficial to help scout and book local talent, which directly affects the economic upward mobility of the business owner, their family and immediate community. On a larger scale, we are inspired to bring life to cities, as live music and art is a major driving factor to the cities' economics - for example the city of Austin generates nearly $2 billion a year from live music alone. Finally we are inspired by SXSW and the people we interacted with along our hackathon journey, from the phone call with UMG to the sponsors and mentors, and all of the tech events and panels in between.

                    For trend analysis and predictions, we will use data derived from financial markets, as well as natural patterns occurring in weather, wave period data from buoys, and traffic data from toll roads. We incorporate 'Elliot Wave Theory' to identify artists breaking into the main stream. Additionally we use Fibonacci sequencing to identify targets that will signal potential breakouts. At the moment we have two types of 'hype' that we categorize -
                    <em>
                        liquid hype
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        illiquid hype
                    </em>
                    . Liquid hype is organic growth with a stable and growing network; illiquid hype is inorganic growth with a weak and manufactured network. We use market data from large financial indices during positive market movements to synthesize patterns which represent organic growth; and volatile pump/dump movements from penny stocks to synthesize patterns which represent illiquid or inorganic growth. The inorganic data is important to filter out, as this is an attempt by our process to bypass artists which pay for fake likes, subscribers, &amp; engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trend analysis reports will be stored on IPFS and referenced by a permission-able blockchain, where only those with permissions can index and view the data. Permissions can be assigned to grant access to license and copyright holders, and permissions can be removed when the license/copyright changes ownership.
