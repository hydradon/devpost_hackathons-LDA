                    canvas_test.py will create a canvas to draw on; the controls are self explanitory, and will output a png to wherever you want to save it; fixed the bullshit conversion because for some reason, tkinter only outputs images in postscript and you need ghostscript to convert the .ps into png and god damnit the hackpoly organizers are fucking rap battling and I don't know why there was only one person who could rhyme and it's 3:10am and why are they doing this? my guess is that the organizers are just working with companies and they aren't actually stem majors and they played really club-tier volume shit music god damnit i cannot work like this. I'll add more comments in a later commit when we get animation working.
