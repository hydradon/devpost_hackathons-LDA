                    BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO MYRA !
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A sales assistant bot built atop Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot focuses on helping a salesperson setup his calendar, book a hotel or rent a car for his sales activities. It not only allows him to be more efficient, but ensures that information is disseminated across the organization seamlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will also allow his supervisor to keep a note of the sales funnel and ensure that appropriate support is provided at the correct time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This demonstrates an implementation of the Lex Code Hook Interface in order to serve a sample bot which acts as a virtual assistant for a salesperson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bot, Intent, and Slot models which are compatible with this have been created after relevant testing. The data and context information are saved to DynamoDB for referring to at a later point in time and set calendar reminders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An invite from salesai.slack.com has been sent to
                    <a href="mailto:testing@devpost.com" rel="nofollow">
                        testing@devpost.com
                    </a>
                    . We have also provided a sample demo video to showcase how the bot may be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot can do the following now (acting as a virtual assistant of the salesperson):
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Rent a car
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Book a Hotel
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter information about sales meetings
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For 1 and 2, they are very similar to the default Lex bots and allows a salesperson to book necessary services necessary for himself. For 3, you can start off a DM with the bot named Myra in the Slack channel (salesai.slack.com) and say something like "I have a client to meet tomorrow". It will then ask a few questions and once that is entered, it will save it in DynamoDB. At a later stage, this may be used to remind the salesperson of his meeting and help him followup properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
