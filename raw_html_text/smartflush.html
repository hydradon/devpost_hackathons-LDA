                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had several challenges along the way. One of the challenges was figuring out how to get a server up and running on the Arduino Uno board. We had an issue with the server library so we opted out of using the Arduino Uno and instead opted in using the Rasberry Pi microprocessor. Deploying a server on the Raspberry Pi was more intuitive than doing it on the Arduino Uno because the Raspberry can operate on the Linux operating system. Having an operating system on our micro-processing board made it easier to implement a server to host out data. 
Additionally, we also faced challenges with the prototype. We did not have the luxury of time to print a full rendering of our model, so we printed a 1:2 scale model which saved us time while still maintaining functionality on the model. To print the full-scale model, that would have taken us 27 hours, which we simply did not have.
