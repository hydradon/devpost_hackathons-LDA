                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we walk around campus everyday, and sometimes it can be hard to find exactly what to wear depending on the weather for that day. We might not know if we need to wear a jacket if it's chilly in the morning and burning hot in the afternoon or if we need to wear rain boots, depending on the percent chance of rain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeatherWear provides a simple application that allows users to check the weather and choose from multiple outfits based on the current weather in their area. Users can enter items from their closet, and the application will determine outfits for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C#, ASP.NET, MVC, and Visual Studio to create the framework for our application. We used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather in that user's location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges setting up the framework for our web application, setting up version control with Github, and downloading Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website looks good. We were able to connect to a weather API and display weather icons depending on the current weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a web application from scratch, C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeatherWear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working on WeatherWear by adding more categories of clothing for users and determine clothing based not only on temperature but also weather, such as rain or snow. We also hope to work more on the website, allow multiple users to use the application, and possibly connect with an IOT device to allow users to take pictures and directly upload to WeatherWear.
