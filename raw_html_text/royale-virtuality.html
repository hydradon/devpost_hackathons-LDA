                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the HTC Vive, the player plays the role of the king, he collects souls that are spawned in front of him and he has to grab them and throw them into the battle field where they resurrect and attack the opponent.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, C# and HTC Vive.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to develop for Vive. We also tried to integrate Leap motion but we decided to drop its support due the limitations of the device.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made a fun game even if the mechanics are very simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop and integrate Virtual reality into Unity with Vive, try out Leap Motion and find out that it's not that accurate after all.
