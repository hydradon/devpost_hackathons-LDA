                    As high school students it is difficult to maintain a healthy sleep schedule. We created this extension hoping that it will help others go to bed at a healthy time and sleep better each night, so they can have greater productivity.

                <h2>
                    This extension tracks the bedtimes of user daily and displays this data back to them to help motivate them. We also asked users for their friends to keep them accountable in maintaining their bedtimes.
