                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to get in the Hot Zones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does - well, what it should do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to create an arena using the available Estimote beacons. Each beacon would then have a point value assigned to it - it's heat - and being nearer the beacon would give you more points. Players would be able to log into the quick-fire 60-second games and try to accumulate as many points as possible in the given time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it actually does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the app is still in a state of development - the front end scoreboard logic and servers all work - they can be accessed at a website and within the app via web view and REST API to see how well people are doing in the game. Sadly, however, the frontend beacon detection isn't implemented fully yet as we are only two people, started with no prior android experience, and the beacon detection didn't quite work.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the Backend server in node.js.
The streaming live leaderboard utilised WebSockets to give users on the website or web view in-app.
