                    Inspiration
Just the curiosity to try something new. Google Glass being limited and now out of service provided exactly the challenge that I was looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
 It's a basic countdown timer app for Glasses using the Glass Development Kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did I build 
The Development process required me to know basics of Android App development. The process included creating a Glass app with the main activity and adding hrs min and seconds to the activity as updatable text fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges faced
Google Glass Drivers being unavailable for Windows 10, had to read previous driver code and manually update the newer driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thing that I am most proud of
 Completing this project before end time and solving all challenges that glass had for me. The Driver issue, random shutdowns and probably a few factory resets but was a pretty good journey, would definitely work on Glasses given the chance.
What did I learn
I learned basic interaction between GDK and Android Studio, and also implementation of a basic app on Glass

                    Future prospects
Next, for the time it is AR support
