                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whats the largest business on the internet? Big data? Cloud computing? Nope. We all know what it is. Nowadays however,  it is less about those high production values of the seventies, and more about dragging the viewer through a long sequence so that the video host can get advertising time. it would be a lot better if we could just skip to the money shot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Facial" recognition, allows a tech savy viewer to skip right to "money shot" in most porn videos. The program loads a video, and using computer vision, finds scenes where....things have progressed to a sort of finishing point. The program then cuts the video around that scene so skip right to the action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting opencv to work was a bit of a mess, but the hardest part was handling the large sample load that was needed to test the program.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lighting was a problem in the image detection, and skin tones interfered with the blob detection.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I never thought it would work, i also never though i would do this....but here I am.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about developing in eclipse...but i wish i hadn't learned some things.....

                <p>
                    Expansion into other categories? Or just dropping off the face of the earth.
