                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, people want to keep a good weight and body type. Also, in the American, the 33.8% adults are obesity. However, we always find the gyms are all full or there is no person who can play with us. As a result, it is always let us to be lazy for the exercise. As a result, we decide to make a android app which use the google map API and the Big Data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We program a android app which is a gym app which can help us find the gym which is available and appointment the exercise. Also, we can find the the friends who can exercise with us nearby and appointment to make the exercise together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, two of our teammates make the Android app UI with the Android Studio. They make the each sides such as the log in screen  and location find using google map API. Then they use that API to calculate the distance of the gym and other persons. What is more, the other two set up the web-service and app-service and make the Big Data work. We use the GBST, pandas to make the data analyze work and get a predict of the people in the each gym. Also, they use the data we get to give the people recommend to do the exercise together.

                    1.we did not use the Google map API before, we use it first times

                        we use the database to store the Big Data

                    <li>
                        we finish the functions which we expect have

                        we will make more and more data and may be we will set up a cloud to store this data in future
