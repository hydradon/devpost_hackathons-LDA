                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few buddies got together and had an crazy impromptu idea of drive down from SF to LA for the weekend. We managed to scrape by some last minute accomodation and transport, but found it difficult to plan activities for the trip. We did a simple google search for the top destinations to hit and  tried to cover as much as we could, which took a lot of effort and planning that we would've liked for an inpromptu trip. Furthermore, only at the end of the trip did we manage to talk to some of the locals at LA and realised that we missed all the good stuff that is not very tourist ridden.

                    My Wanderlust helps you to plan your itinerary based on reviews on Yelp and the constraints of your travel - duration and location. It also goes the extra mile of planning a route for you to take, accounting for meals at reputable restaurants as well.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used the maps functionality of HERE to plot our geocodes and route our travels. Yelp provided us with reliable reviews and suggestions on places to hit for the day.
