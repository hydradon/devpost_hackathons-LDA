                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When visiting the doctor, we get to take our XRay scans home. But what about 3D scans?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app, you can view the 3D scans you took at the doctors office home, in your own smartphone. Additionally, if you have a VR headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung VR, you can experience your scans in Virtual Reality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took a 3D scan of myself at Planmeca stand and after some work I inserted it in my Android VR app. I used MeshLab to edit the scan and export the way I needed it, and Unity to create the app and use the scan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Meshlab, editing  the texture of my scan to make it look better, coding the dynamic rotation of the scan in VR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WOW reaction as I gave my peers around me the chance to try my demo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D formats, Meshlab and how to edit 3D meshes, difference between 3D meshes, materials,shaders, and textures and how to work with them in Unity. How to program for the google daydream controller

                <h2>
                    What's next for MyScans
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop it until it's ready to be used by clinics and hospitals or test centers, so that they can offer their clients the  chance to view their scans at home.
