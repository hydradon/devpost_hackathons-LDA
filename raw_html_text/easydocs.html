                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doctors listed the burden of paperwork as their top concern in the Medical Economics 89th Annual Physician Report (Dahl, 2018). We aim to drastically reduce the burden medical facilities face, by providing an automated solution to create and update patient records.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasyDocs reduces the time clinicians spend on paperwork by automatically providing them with up to date electronic patient information. This helps doctors learn of their patients' health condition and risks more efficiently, allowing for more time with patients and less time with paper.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Django, we created an application that prevents SQL injection attacks, cross-site request forgery tokens and prevents against clickjacking, to ensure that a patient's medical data is secure from hackers. We also used jQuery and CSS to provide a better user interface and user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time working with Django, there were quite a few bumps along the way, like importing modules, and coming up with the right queries. At one point early on, we lost some code after someone forgot to pull the updated repo before pushing their own repo. Additionally, we did not have any experience with UI, as well as database management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that despite not having much UI/front-end experience as a group, we still managed to put something together that works and looks decent. We're also proud that we were able to collaborate effectively despite meeting each other for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set-up a backend with Django, and also how to do queries. We learned how to put together a working prototype, incorporating front-end and back-end in a very short time. We also learned how to work with GET/POST requests in an MVC framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasyDocs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to improve the platform by providing an even better user interface and user experience by creating a single page application for healthcare professionals, as well as creating an authentication system and a logging system to allow medical professionals to further monitor and ensure medical data complies to PIPEDA standards. We also aim to integrate an optical character recognition system which allows doctors to immediately get a patient's data when their health card is scanned.
