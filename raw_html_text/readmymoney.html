                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we are seeking to create something that could benefit our society, and when we were brainstorming we though how we could possibly help people with disabilities. One of our team members is inspired by a blind student here at the University of Florida who has the determination to go to the gym as early as he does every day. Our teammate said he couldn't imagine the struggles that he could face each and every day of his life, and that is why we created ReadMyMoney

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReadMyMoney is an innovative and revolutionary method to help blind people read and recognize their money through an app in order to avoid any confusion and any attempts for anyone around their surroundings to take advantage of their disability. We found that many blind people across the world often have an issue when handling their money as they obviously can not see, and have to rely on the trust of a merchant, and stranger when purchasing or exchanging their money.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Unity.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many errors throughout this hack, and fortunately with great teamwork and patience we sought to resolve the issues and strive for our end goal.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very proud that we managed to create something worthy that could potentially impact our society. We aim to aid blind people to overcome a everyday struggle they face, which is handling and becoming aware of their currency.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew how to use Unity before this hackathon, and therefore it was a great learning experience. Most of the time that was spent throughout this hackathon was mainly learning how to program and use Unity in order to complete our hack.

                <p>
                    We want to add more features including voice recognition, ability to read other currencies, and much more!
