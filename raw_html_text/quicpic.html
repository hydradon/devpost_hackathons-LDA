                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from ride-sharing and food delivery apps that ease daily tasks. In the age of social media and endless photo opportunities, we want to make ~aesthetic~ photoshoots as easy as getting a ride from Uber or ordering tacos on DoorDash. This is why we came up with QuicPic, to make taking good pictures easy, fast, and affordable.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuicPic is a location-based service that matches users with nearby photographers instantly. Similarly to other real-time service apps, users can enter their locations and the durations of the desired service to request a photoshoot. Our extensive database finds and pair photographers to our users.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website with html and css. Our app (in extreme early development stage) is built with React and JavaScript. (App documents did not upload correctly :/ )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of beginners that only have very basic skills in Python, we decided to take on the challenge to play around with html, css, and React. Initially, we tried to use Kivy and Beeware to create an app, since both of these require only Python knowledge. However, since Python is not the most popular language for app-building, we ran into a lot of trouble with Kivy and Beeware, and decided to not go with either one. We then switched to using React to create a very basic app interface.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have completed our first Hackathon and actually created something tangible. We are very excited to have created our first website and app.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learnt a lot about front-end development, html, css, app development, and just turning a random idea into real life. We learnt what a Hackathon entails and how much we enjoy it!
                </p>

                    What's next for QuicPic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future for QuicPic is exciting. We hope to continue our mobile application development and explore the possibilities of back-end development.
