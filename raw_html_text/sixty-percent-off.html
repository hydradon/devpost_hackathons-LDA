                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SIXT has the vision to combine car rental and car sharing - and therefore, the service SIXT Delivery offers the possibility for the customer to get his rented car directly in front of his door.
But how does the car get there? The current practice is that SIXT sends two employees with an extra car to move the car to the desired location - which is really inconvenient, expensive and absolutely not eco-friendly. Our goal was to improve this procedure without restricting the customers' comfort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>

                        SIXTy percent off
                    </strong>
                    - a combination of car rental and car sharing - is our concept to resolve this problem. The main idea is to let 'usual' people help SIXT to move the cars - for this service, they get these rides for cheaper.
This works as follows: SIXT has a database about all SIXT Delivery bookings, so the company knows when which car has to be at which location. The user now wants to get from A to B. And maybe there is a car which has to be moved into a similar direction. So he could simply take the car to B even though B is not his intended and final destination.
In short: He can take a car roughly at his position and take it to the delivery station / the start point of the next customer using this car. This has advantages for both sides - the user gets a 60% discount on his ride and SIXT does not have to send employees to move the cars.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built with Java Spring, the frontend with an Angular WebApp. We used the SIXT and the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we have never built an WebApp with Angular before, it took us some time to learn it. But it was the challenge we posed to ourselves.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    A running version of our software! In addition to that, we could get finished in time without being too stressed about the deadline - which is actually an success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular and Java Spring.
And we learned that we probably should be one of the first ones to pick on of the good rooms next year.
