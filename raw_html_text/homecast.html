                    The default display option after playing media on Chromecast is to cycle through a slide show. We wanted to create a dashboard to replace the slide show, updating people on the most important areas of their life, such as news, social media, and the weather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface is highly customizable to display what the user would like to see on their dashboard through dragging and dropping options in a mobile application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile application using Android Studio, and used jquery to design chromecast portion of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create so many options of customizability for the user. We were able to not only create different options of widgets, but also create lots of customization with the sizing and location of the different widgets on the dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nobody on the team had ever developed with Chromecast before, so we all gained knowledge about that. In addition, one of the members of the team had never done mobile application development before, so that was also a great learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we can continue to create more options of widgets to add to the dashboard.
