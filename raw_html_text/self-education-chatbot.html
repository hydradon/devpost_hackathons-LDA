                    My inspiration for creating the Autodidact University Chatbot solution is based on the fact displacement often separates refugee girls from their teachers or mentors. Therefore, I am focused to assist refugee girls who demonstrate extraordinary intellectual development to self-educate themselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The chatbot accesses closed captioning and/or subtitles of tutorial videos and presents them in a chatbot for a conversation. She chooses the subject she plans to study, her studying material and the studying rhythm and time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I built the app with a node.js backend.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I ran into few technical challenges. The theme of this challenge opened my eyes and mind to realize there are millions of girls around the world that are not in school for various reasons. And, so, the challenge I ran into was to empathize with them while visiting an air-conditioned environment at Facebook, Inc.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am proud to have assisting two additional teams to create and develop their own solutions to this contest.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned is that 93 percent of all refugees live in areas that are at least covered by a 2G network, and almost two-thirds (62 percent) live in locations covered by 3G networks&mdash;all consistent with global mobilenetwork penetration rates.  While coverage and quality are progressively improving in rural areas due to increasing mobile-network penetration, rural refugee locations are at risk of being overlooked in these expansion plans. Only one in six rural refugees (17 percent) live in areas with 3G coverage, compared with 29 percent of the global rural population. One in five rural refugees (20 percent) have no mobile coverage at all&mdash;double the portion of the global rural population without any coverage.
