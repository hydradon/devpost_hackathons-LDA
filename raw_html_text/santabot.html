                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Norad's Santa Tracker started as a result of a misprint in a Sears ad for a Santa hotline. I was thinking about how kids used to call Santa from local newspaper hotlines, and realized they're not as popular as they used to be. Kids text more than they call nowadays, so I felt like the only solution was a chatbot.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads user input, regardless of specifics, and gives answers based on what the user asked for. This part was done with Wit.AI. Twilio handled the messaging end

                    Maybe take it public? Share it around December and see how kids enjoy it.
