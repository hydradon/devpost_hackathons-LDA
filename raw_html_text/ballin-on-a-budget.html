                    We needed to be realistic about what we could accomplish because we wanted to go to so many of the workshops and talks. So we decided to flesh out a few ideas, and decided that we would create a prototype and work on using an API as an example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to get help with Adobe XD from Zaid to figure out how to use icons and Repeat Grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No experience with using an API would be complete without a great deal of frustrations... Luckily Laureen came to our rescue.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Adobe Xd made us so excited about UI. None of us has used it before this weekend, and we were blown away at how easy and quick we were able to make a prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using an API was an important piece for us because we wanted to show a more technical side of the project. Being able to give a small example of the Google Maps API was a huge win!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of the fact we were able to sleep before cramming our submission before 8!

                <p>
                    Adobe Xd is our new best friend.
If you&rsquo;re going to use Google Maps API and JavaScript, you actually need to use Google Maps JavaScript API! Who knew!
