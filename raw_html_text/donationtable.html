                    <li>
                        New framework: React-native was new for everyone in the team, but love challenges! And we struggle a little, but even when we didn't finish the app in this hackathon, we want to completed it and set it to live.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Broken node: one of the team members (me) uninstall node following instructions of the error message, after that the computer didn't display the app tests.

                    We are proud of the fast we could learn some us of elements, but we still want to continue playing around React-native. We are also proud that we never give up and how optimistic we always are.
