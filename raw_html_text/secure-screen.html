                    Have you ever forgotten to lock your screen and left you computer unattended?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At about 12:30 AM this past Friday (3/25/16), there were over 10 computers with their screens unlocked and unattended in the HackGSU hacker space. Any malicious person could have easily plugged a teensy device (macro enabled USB device to emulate a keyboard) and installed malware across all of these machines without anyone knowing.
                    <br>
                    The Secure Screen automatically locks a computer when the user leaves it unattended.

                <h2>
                    Current State of Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were no infrared sensors available at this hackathon, but there was a Leap Motion. The Leap SDK was used to trigger locking the screen by simply the end user waving their hand "good bye" to the computer. There is also a hidden feature which allows the end user to quickly hide their screen by spawning a new Chrome browser with a specified webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Future and Beyond
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion is not in the future of the Secure Screen and was solely used for a PoC. However, infrared technology can be used to identify not only gestures, but the unique heat profile of a user. If the user leaves their machine, the Secure Screen infrared device will trigger the daemon to automatically lock the screen for the user.
