                <p>
                    Baseball attendance has remained static as the world population is increasing. More and more people are going to baseball games, not understanding what is going on and this discourages them from wanted to see the sport. We want to fix this.

                    Pitch-ionary provides users the definition of baseball terminology that most people don't know about.

                    We built this application with a Firebase backend, React frontend, and Gatsby for deployment.

                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into was grabbing caption data from a Youtube video of live stream of an MLB match.

                    We built a really simple looking and awesome application within the one day time limit!

                    What we learned:

                    Audience engagement is important! The quality of a baseball game can be maximized if the entire audience can understand!
                </p>

                    Future state:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully collaborate with MLB TV to integrate this application with the live stream and figure out how to get caption data.
