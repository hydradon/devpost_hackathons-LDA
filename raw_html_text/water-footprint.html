                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took on the water conservation challenge that EcoLab put on for us.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Alexa to allow the user to ask questions about water usage in making food.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS and Python to create the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us have not had any experience with AWS and understanding the system was a struggle.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We're proud we made something out of resources we'd never worked with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do not like APIs and SDKs with minimal documentation.
                </p>
