                    StudyCenterEverywhere is PollEverywhere for study centers. It is an AI assistant that helps both students and TAs/instructors by making it easier to both ask and answer questions. The goal of StudyCenterEverwhere is to be the solution to specific problems in the education system, to make education both efficient and inclusive, equitable.

                <p>
                    Study centers (also known as learning centers or drop-in tutoring) are places where students can come in, ask questions, and have a TA/instructor help answer them. They have been established at schools, colleges around the world and play an important role in many people's education. At UW Seattle alone, thousands of students use study centers; the most well known ones are...

                        - sometimes, there is no paper/queue at all for asking questions, the more outspoken student is favored

                    Study centers have an important part in education with students, TAs, instructors using them every single day of the school year. What if we could use tech to solve these above problems and enable a better education for all?

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To solve the problems of study centers, we built a study center manager that assists both students and TAs/instructors. It is an assistant (usable from Skype or Microsoft Teams) that automates registration, queuing, and question submission that would otherwise be done manually. The assistant uses state-of-the-art AI, ML, NLP technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This solution is built using Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud as well as open-source libraries for machine learning.
