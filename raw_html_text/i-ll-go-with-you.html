                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NC's governor passed a really shitty law that forces people to use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificate. This is discriminatory against the transgender community and has made a lot of people not feel safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IGWY allows users with a .edu (for now) email to sign up as either a user or an ally. Users are able to identify what gender they would prefer an ally that goes with identifies. A user can find users in their area that are allies and notify whichever user they choose. An ally will get a notification when a user requests them. The ally can then choose to go with or decline the notification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio and Firebase. And GIMP for design :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Setting up finding users locations. Thank you Firebase!

                <p>
                    I got most of the design done and figured out everything I need to get it actually working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase and geofire packages.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Actually getting it to work for a few users at school.
