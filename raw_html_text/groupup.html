                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be hard to find study groups or pick-up games within your own circle of friends, so a local aggregation of others' events and groups can allow you to meet new people to study with, play with, or hang out with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It aggregates events posted by other local users and yourself, and shows them in a categorized, browsable list for you to look through, and RSVP to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client app is built for Android devices through Android Studio, back end is hosted on Amazon Web Services, and requests for the server are handled by a Python script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between all of us we have very little app dev experience, database experience, and client-to-server communication experience. We used all new technologies (for us) so most of the weekend had to be spent learning how to build what we wanted within them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the services we're using (Android, Amazon Web Services, etc.), and were able to get most of the pieces working on their own, even if we havn't put it all together yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How hard it can be to crash-course yourself through three new technologies in a weekend, then combine them all into one coherent experience. Also learned some new strategies for pouring over new APIs in a way that has a quick enough turnaround to start using them in a weekend.
                </p>

                    Well hopefully finishing the app.
