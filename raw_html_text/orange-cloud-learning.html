                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started this project incidentally a few months back when my son (5 years old) arrived home with a paper sheet of 2 rhymes to help him learn the days of the week. I then developed an Alexa Skill to talk the rhymes to my son. I then thought this could work wonders for other types of education that requires constant repetition, like counting in French, Periodic Table elements, Timestable's and much more that hasn't entered my brain yet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa Skill will teach the user a few different things that schools would call "Repetition learning" where the teachers and parents would have to repeat the learning until the child picks it up on there own. This Skill is to take away the parent or teacher having to complete the repetition. The child can do it by speaking with Alexa...
                    <code>
                        Alexa, open Orange Cloud Learning and teach me to count in French
                    </code>
                    This will have Alexa count to 20 in French.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app using an AWS Lambda Function, utilizing the Python 3.6 language.
I also utilise CI / CD by having a BitBucket Pipeline upload my new code on every commit (in deploy branch) to delay my testing/deployment.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the time to complete the skill to how I want it. With my toddler son, new born son and my full time employment is hard to get some time to code.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact my toddler son actually uses it! To see your idea and Skill come to life is amazing. I am looking at sharing it with my friends soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python 3.6 and children have so much fun when talking to Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Orange Cloud Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to develop this skill further and the last aim would be to get it into a classroom.
