                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was inspired, ironically, by a lack of inspiration. Plenty of times, I've personally googled "What to do in South Jersey" with results that are, at best, only up to par. With Rondeh, we want to create an active community where people can be given suggested activities based on their location, interests, and other criteria. They can either go with friends, or they can meet new people with the same interests as themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app brings people with the same goal into one clean space that is designed to propose original, fun, and personal activities and events. Users can discover an array of activities (such as: bowling, go-karts, petting-zoos, visit a museum, etc.); users can also socially network to connect with others with mutual interests in activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GUI with a website using the basics (HTML, CSS, and JS) and an iOS App powered on the front-end side with React-Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was (past-tense) compiled of all first-time hackers. So we all had to take on a big learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all able to have an equal say to work well together planning, designing, and coding. Personally, I have never used react-native or any other mobile application language; even only getting a Homepage with minimal functionality was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From watching other's ideas and developing one, a great project does not necessarily have to be the most complex code using the most advanced tech (while those are very cool), some of the best developing is from a great idea paired with great planning, design, and a group willing to see through their vision through despite the bugs, lack of knowledge, and personal inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rondeh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After HackPrinceton, I would personally like to work with the same team to finish the functionality of the app with API's and more back-end coding, complete a marketable design, and share with friends for feedback. This feedback could possibly lead to more work on the project or simply serve as knowledge to keep in mind for all of ours next project.
