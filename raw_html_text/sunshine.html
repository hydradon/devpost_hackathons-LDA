                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During BoilerMake VI 2018 Purdue, a 36-hour hackathon which welcomes all levels of experience and provides tools and resources, our team decided to focus on creating a convenient way to analyize the weather. After being able to talk to sponsors for BoilerMake and other students, we wanted to create a convenient way to analyze the weather. Often times, weather data can be overwhelming and hard to consider the factors of wind, precipitation, humidity, and temperature. Through Sunshine, we wanted to allow users to know what type of clothing to wear without having to complicate weather data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A user-driven Alexa skill and web application that suggests clothing preference based off of weather and user's response to different weather conditions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing something new, we ran into a lot of errors. For the Alexa, it was a challenge to find a way to request a POST from the endpoint. For MongoDB-Stitch, it was challenging to get accustomed to storing data in a new way. For TensorFlow.js, familiarizing ourselves with machine learning was new.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to create a product that can be published.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never used MongoDB-Stitch, TensorFlow.js, and Alexa Skills, we learned how to utilize these tools and resources to our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sunshine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to see Sunshine grow outside of just Alexa and web application but also to mobile. Towards Alexa, we would want to create new commands to further allow convenience. Not only that, we can improve the modeling of the prediction service. To further scale the service, we would require a better way to manage the data base as well.
