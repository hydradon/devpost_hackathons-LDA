                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental Health impacts everyone's lives every single day. The form we have created caters to exactly that issue and topic in a shameless, selfless way. Taking care of ones mental health should be as important as a usual doctors check-up when we don't feel good. We want to change that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    miHealth allows the user to choose from two basic emotions, happy and sad. It then prompts the user to enter a journal entry. The journal entry asks user to enter the date, a more specific emotion, and the events that may have contributed to the emotion. It then saves the entry into a text file. Resources are also available to user upon clicking the "Resources" button.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using object oriented programming in python 2.7.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Errors concerning the GUI

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a project at our first Hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project management and planning are key steps in the development process and skipping them can lead to many fatal errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for miHealth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop miHealth further by integrating into a web application and including more options and emotions for the user to choose from.
