                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wildfires are becoming an increasingly more difficult problem to suppress. 2018 was a record-breaking year with the biggest wildfires recorded in USA, and UK experiencing one of the hottest summer in the recent history. To help prevent spreading wildfires and indicate the areas  of high risk, we devised a web app using a Machine Learning Model that predicts the occurence and the size of the wildfire.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        On.Fire
                    </strong>
                    offers a web application which helps you predict the wildfire in the specific location. It indicates the high risk areas on the map and estimates the size of the possible fire. We also display the news to provide users with a recent information about wildfires. The friendly user interface combined together with our ML model to predict the occurence of the wildfire makes the app intuitive and simple to use.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took advantage of
                    <strong>
                        Python Flask
                    </strong>
                    to create the web server, and the
                    <strong>
                        Microsoft Azure
                    </strong>
                    to build the database. To visualise the areas of danger, the
                    <strong>
                        Heat Map
                    </strong>
                    was applied. Also, we used
                    <strong>
                        News API
                    </strong>
                    to display wildfire-related news and the
                    <strong>
                        OpenWeather API
                    </strong>
                    to provide a correct input to the ML model. We chose the
                    <strong>
                        Extra-trees Regressor
                    </strong>
                    as our ML model.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The training data for the ML Model was very difficult to find. There is a lot of different causes of wildfires such as geographical location, type of the soil or humidity which are not that easily available online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a user-friend web app which can potentially make the world safer. We learnt to use new tools and technologies which made us better hackers. We have faced many programming challenges when developing the project but managed to overcome it as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the integration of each component of the project is quite consuming process and the most important one as well. Also, good idea and teamwork can make the project stand out from the others
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for On.Fire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to increase the awareness of the rising risk of the wildfires. If there would be enough interest, we would love to improve the web app further
