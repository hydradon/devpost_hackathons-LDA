                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the car ride to KnightHacks, we wanted to use an arduino to detect any music and just create an OSU instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play a song, the arduino detects it, and a beat map is generated for you to play!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mobile app in react native.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Breaking down the rhythm of the beat, react native issues
