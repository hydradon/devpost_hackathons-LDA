                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The University of Kansas is home to one of the nations best basketball teams, but also, bar scenes and fun. But too many times students like myself look forward to having a great night but end up disappointed when we arrive to find out no one is there, the music is wack, or that some other bar is poppin' tonight. This isn't only a social issue, but also, a financial issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So I built Livn, a real time checkin app for Lawrence Bars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the swift language and taking advantage of Firebase and Facebook APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that I ran into were learning new things to achieve the functionality I wanted, simplifying the problem for version 1, time issues because I had to work all day Saturday, and lastly, the fact I did not have a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I'm 80% of the way to having something useful that I can put into people's hands to start testing and iterating upon. However, I do acknowledge that the final 20% will be the toughest part since it involves things I have not learned yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is important to prioritize features, break the problem down into doable pieces, and to never give up and to ask for help when you need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Livn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to turn Livn into a social budgeting app that allows people to budget for the things in their lives. But this initial version of Livn will allow me to position the product as social first, creating the mental model for the user that I'm budgeting for what I already am doing. This is a huge differentiator compared to other financial applications that emphasize the money side of things.
