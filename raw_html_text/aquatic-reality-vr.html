                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our overpopulated world today, pollution and trash is a huge problem. Not just for our living conditions, but the conditions of those we may not think about. The lives of fishes are at danger everyday due to all the TRASH. We hope to bring this issue into light and hope that our players will enjoy the game while realizing the importance of properly disposing of trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our virtual reality app is a game in which you gain points by consuming other fish, however as time goes on, more and more trash becomes spawned in the field making it become more and more difficult to catch the fish as the game progresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity and C# script files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew about virtual reality, game making, C#, Unity, what we wanted to make at first, or really anything about our project at first. We jumped in headfirst and made a pretty decent game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something out of nothing, and something that will hopefully make at least one person decide to make the world a better place for the fishies out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots and lots of stuff.
                </p>

                    More maps, stages, animations, and cool graphical stuff.
