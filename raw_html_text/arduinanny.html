                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parents everywhere spend all their time watching their babies. Most parents are up all night because thir children wake up crying in the middle of the night. We wanted to fix this by making a device that will put children back to sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduinanny is placed near your child's bed. When it detects that your child has woken up and started crying, it will play soothing music, putting your children back to sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino uno to run the code for our device, attached a speaker and microphone with amplifier to this arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    playing music tones on the arduino proved more difficult than we thought, because the notes on a piano are not the same as the notes on our speaker.  We ran into difficulty translating music to the arduino, and ended up re writing the sheet music to the Arduino. 
None of us knew how to program arduino, so we had to learn how to program from scratch, and spend many hours looking at tutorials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the microphone to accurately measure when noise has passed a certain level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code c++ for Arduino. 
We learned how microphones work, and the necessary electronic circuts needed to amplify the signal.
We learned how to read sheet music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arduinanny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next the arduinanny needs to play a variety of songs, detect more accurately what the child is doing, and respond based on this.
