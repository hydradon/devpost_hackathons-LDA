                    Our team "The AUM Squad" decided to take on the education challenge as many of us are currently enrolled at college and know what it's like to try and find activities and clubs we are interested in. Using our skills in computer science we developed a web based application that serves to make finding school activities simple and easy. The Application accomplishes this by offering filtering options to filter school's by what activities they offer. We have also planned to add features in the future to allow students to petition and notify the schools of what activities they are interested in. Allowing the schools to better meet the needs of their student body. The back-end of the application was built using C# .net core framework. The reason we chose these methods was because they have broad platform support which allows the application to be hosted off of our raspberry pi 4.

                <p>
                    In order to work efficiently in our limited amount of time, we used Microsoft Azure DevOps and Visual Studio to collaborate. This allowed us to push and pull code effectively. We also utilized Slack as a method of fast communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even with our experience in computer science, we still ran into a number of technical issues that needed to be resolved. One of the primary issues was loading .net core onto the raspberry pi 4. As the 4th generation of pi is fairly new, solutions to problems and tutorials were not as broadly available. Early in our development we ran into problems when multiple people worked on the same section of code. We were able partially fix the issue by using Azure DevOps; however, proper communication in person and over slack was necessary to prevent code conflicts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are very proud of what we were able to create. We believe the application we developed is effective and solves the challenge that we chose. Especially considering we had less than 48 hours to accomplish our goal. For many of us, it was our first time using a raspberry pi. As a team we were able to learn what the Pi is capable of and consider what we might use the technology for in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given more time and resources, we would like to expand on the features we developed over the weekend. In our first discussions we considered what extra features we would include if we were given the time. Ultimately, we would like to see the application progress into a fully featured way for the students and schools to interact with each other.
