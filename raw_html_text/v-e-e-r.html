                    While going through our teams strengths, we realized we had inventive coders, designs, as well as a physics major.  In addition to this, two of our members are automotive enthusiasts (car guys).  We set out to brainstorm problems and solutions applicable to automotive enthusiasts and decided to make V E E R .

                    Many car guys "track" their cars.  By this, we mean they try to find their fastest lap time on a closed course.  To get fast, one has to go as fast as possible through turns.  Many times, it is hard to estimate this speed and people lose time going slow, or get into accidents when going to fast.  V E E R aims to remove the guesswork.  It is a simple app that will be running on a phone while mounted in the car.  Using sensors such as an accelerator and gyroscope, V E E R shows the maximum speed possible while going through turns.

                    We used Java and our IDE was android studio.

                    It took us many tries to figure out how to implement a phone's sensor information into the app.  After extensive research and time, we successfully had it displayed on the UI.

                    This is our second hackathon, and right from the get-go, it has been a major improvement.  Instead of jumping into one idea, we developed many and picked the best and most realistic one.  Work was delegated much better between the 4 of us and we hope to improve more for the next hackathon.

                    Even though some ideas may appeal to a very niche market, it is worth developing as it may have more uses with other audiences with further development

                    The UI (especially the text) needs to be cleaned up to be more appealing.  In addition to this, we hope to increase accuracy by collecting more data.
