                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was my peers. Because this is a problem that we feel like people go through and on a long journey to actually solving it. Also was the people here at the Hackathon was a big inspiration because a lot of the people we asked about if they go through what we are trying to solve  any most of them answered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that is suppose to boost people up. For example they will provide people who are feeling sad, mad, and tired we will provide them with a song that suppose to boost up the people. After that we also provide an area where people who are bullied and people would give advice. This would allow people to keep and contact with other and help them with their problems.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge was that my team faced is the fact most of us do not know how to code and the person who does has very limited amount of knowledge. Another issue is that we encounter is actually keeping it simple enough for this project instead of making it big at the beginning make it small and give it space to expand

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big accomplishment was finishing because we had no knowledge on what we are doing and for us not only to be done but have to something to be proud of. In the long run we was able to code the project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code. Also learned it takes a while to make a website and maintain it. There is a lot of things that goes into making a website and you need to think about who you going target that the minor details is actually more important.

                <p>
                    Next for Add-vice is we would like to expand to where we are able to solve more social justice problems and then we would like to provide ways to standup to bullies or even give methods to cope.
