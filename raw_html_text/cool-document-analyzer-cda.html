                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Industry representative Keith talked to us about a growing trend in the industry where people are taking more control of their medical records. When we looked at the medical records we thought that there had to be an easier way for people to understand their medical history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, we only have limited functionality on the front end. Once completed, the webpage would allow a user to upload their own CDA and provide them with a clear visualization of their medical history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end with bootstrap and the back end with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges using python to convert the CDA xml into a more readable format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the front end and the hackathon experience we gained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of python, javascript, and bootstrap; as well as how to pace ourselves during a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cool Document Analyzer (CDA)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to have a fully functional back end so we can get rid of the hard coded examples. We would also like to expand the front end with user tested feautres.
