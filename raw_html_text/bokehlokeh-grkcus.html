                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had this idea while walking home from University one day. We can detect objects, what if we could compress video files and preserve detail at the same time??
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BokehLokeh uses haar cascades to detect faces, portraits and full body figures and selectively compresses the details surrounding them for up to 50-80% bandwidth savings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python, OpenCV and Haar Cascades. Python begins a media stream with computers webcam, OpenCV detects objects of interest within that stream and creates regions surrounding them. The corresponding regions in a pixelated version of the frame are then zeroed out and the regions from the non pixelated frame are then added like a mask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, BokehLokeh is a proof of concept. It is possible to see the potential bandwidth savings and adjust the pixelation level of the surrounding details, but it has not yet been leveraged in a security camera or video chatting software.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    getting a stream between 2 computers via sockets.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about numpy arrays, opencv, and alternative approaches to object detection besides machine learning. I increased my understanding of sockets.
                </p>

                    What's next for BokehLokeh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably a re-implementation in JavaScript or C++ so it can be more easily leveraged for its use cases. Alternatively, immediate and utter abandonment.
