                    <li>
                        We wanted to explore new APIs while also solving a real-world problem. Many fraud detection systems are based solely on heuristics, but we wanted to try using machine learning techniques.

                        Queries CapitalOne's Nessie API for a user's transactions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trains a SVM, and continuously queries for new transactions

                    <li>
                        Looks for anomalies using the SVM
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If an anomaly is detected, send the user a text message with the details of the offending transaction(s)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Since the Capital One API didn't have a good Python wrapper, we first built a complete python wrapper for the API that covers all the endpoints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For classification we decided to use a support vector machine provided by the scikit-learn package.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After initially getting a user's transactions and training the SVM on them we continuously query the API for new transactions. We classify the new transactions using the SVM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the transaction trips our SVM, then we use the Twilio API to send the user a text message.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge we had was reliably classifying transactions. We ended up using only 3 parameters: amount and the longitude and latitude of the merchant. We only started getting reliable predictions after we normalized the inputs to a range from 0 to 1

                        We would like to ask the user for a confirmation on whether the transaction was actually fraudulent or not. If it was, then we would cancel the purchase.

                    <li>
                        We would also like to keep track of the user's budget and alert them if they are close to exceeding it.
