                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, sleep is a
                    <em>
                        major
                    </em>
                    problem. Sometimes we just need someone to tell us when to go to bed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mombot is an Amazon Alexa app which tells you when you should go to bed, and if you ask her to wait five minutes, she lets you know that she will come back in five minutes. If you get upset with her, she sings you "Daisy, Daisy" as a lullaby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Alexa Developer Console to create Mombot, and we connected it to an Alexa so that it can be used in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa Developer console was somewhat difficult to work with because its instructions were mostly in fairly long courses, and we did not have the time to do those. We had to search around to find quick, easy explanations of how to use the developer console, which made it somewhat difficult to use. The phrasing changes that we made in Daisy Daisy also does not function on the physical Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our Alexa to respond and talk to us. Since the developer console was so difficult to use, we are really proud of the fact that we managed to make it function consistently. We also made Alexa sing "Daisy Daisy" in a frustrated way, which was somewhat time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use "intents", "slots",  and "utterances" in the Amazon Alexa. We also learned about how to work with the Alexa's phrasing. This is the first hackathon project that three of the four of us have made, too.

                    What's next for Mom Droid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mom Droid will have more responses to questions, and it will have edited intonation to sound annoyed or comforting depending on the phrase, as well. Mom Droid will be able to have a more in-depth conversation, and it will be able to sing while not frustrated, as well.
