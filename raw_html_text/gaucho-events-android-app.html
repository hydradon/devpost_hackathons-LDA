                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are freshman at UCSB and would want an app that contains all types of events that are occurring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android application is developed to connect UCSB students interested in attending all types of UCSB Events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble navigating Android Studio and Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to have a working app with very minimal functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Github and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gaucho Events Android App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to keep expanding the app and potentially have UCSB students use this app.
