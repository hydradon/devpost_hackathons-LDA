                </h2>
                <p>
                    One in five Americans have mental health conditions. The number of young adults suffering from major depressive episodes is increasing shockingly fast, from 8% to 12% in just a year. These statistics alone are worrying enough, but the burden on the healthcare system and the patient&mdash;the insurance copays, visitation fees, finding the right therapist among the already limited number. Even at UVA alone, the psychological services have waits up to a month long.

                <p>
                    Even therapy isn't just effective if not planned and attended consistently, but one thing therapists will always offer in lieu of being able to help is small tips or tricks, like "Treat yourself as if you were your own best friend."

                    Treat Yourself aims to separate players from themselves as much as possible so they can feel like they are treating a friend.
