                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to start using Unity for the first time as none of us really knew how to make a video game. We thought that making a Guitar Hero-like game would be a good experience for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a song, converts it to MIDI notes, and allows the player to play the song with the created notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our laptops were not as powerful as we imagined it to be so we had to scale back on the whole thing and just do a 2D game rather than a 3D game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn the intricacies of Unity and how to play around with sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Same, we learnt how to use C# with Unity and how to deal with scenes and sprites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to turn this into a proper game.
