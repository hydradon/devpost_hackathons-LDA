                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the next few decades, natural and man-made disasters, such as, fires, earthquakes, flooding, have been predicted to rise and as population growth continues to increase rapidly, many more victims and deaths will be affected. Our inspiration is to create the Next Gen Search and Rescue (SAR) platform using 5G and exponential technologies to support disaster relief and support first responders, emergency medical providers, and non-medical civilians on the ground and remotely to increase communications and improve decision-making strategies to expedite the mobilization of local and remote resources to save lives. A major reason to developing this app is the potential to integrate the platform into existing emergency medical systems to support disaster relief situations and reduce the number of life threatening emergency medical scenarios and to offer immediate remote interventions.and co-ordination planning and execution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Search and Rescue (SAR) 5G is a dual facing application with two states: "God Mode" allows Mission Control a bird's eye view of an apartment blueprint, which can be pulled in from public records and populated in virtual space. GPS coordinates and live video streams are sent in from responders on the scene, including coordinate markers that highlight important features such as active victim, hazard, or exit route. These are then visualized on the blueprint in real time, with alert tones highlighting when new markers have been placed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "Scout Mode" interface is used by responders on the scene. The design is simple, with only two buttons on screen: new marker and SOS feed, which activates live video stream to Mission Control. As Scout Mode explores the building, it reveals the map and preserves the path data of where the responder has been. All scouts are able to see each other, all markers populated in the space, and a bird's eye map of what has been traversed by all scouts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some additional features we would like to see developed include:
-Compass for scout mode
-Set waypoints from God Mode that are viewable by scouts
-Proper AR map and model for God Mode
-Spatially located voice memos attached to markers
-Real time meshing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Unity utilizing open beta Teleportal platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping frame rate high enough while streaming video over 5G.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Systematically revealing map in God Mode proved tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shared persistence of markers on all devices. Device locations are tracked in real time space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real time meshing is still off the table with current technologies. By getting to experience 5G, we are now able to better understand the capabilities and limitations.
