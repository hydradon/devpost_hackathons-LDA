                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through an intuitive interface you can purchase zed coins directly from the website and it will never be listed on an exchange. Because zeds are only purchasable through one medium of exchanging with a fixed exchanged rate ($1USD = 1 ZED) the coin becomes stable. The money you send to the platform gets saved in escrow which makes it fully liquidatable. You can then focus on how to utilize cryptocurrency as money because you can perceive value of items but also utilize the fact that it is programmable money.
