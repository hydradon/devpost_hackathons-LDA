                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Love for craft beers.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Recommends beer to the user by taking the result of the user's previously experience beers into a choice of filtered list of the Beer's attributes such as IBUs (International Bitterness Units) and ABVs (Alcohol by volume) that best matches the user's experience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of the members used Swift to develop this IOS Application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all beginners with Swift, so we constantly ran into multiple syntax and compilation errors as we found out about more parts of Swift programming. This was really time consuming because we had to study what we were doing and what the error causes were simultaneously.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nicholas Dry - Came up with the original idea, Gathered raw (beer) data from the web, designed application architecture, helped her members learn swift, and implemented multiple application functionalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hemil Patel - Implemented multi-layered designs, and gathered raw web data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul Kim - Implemented basic arithmetic functions for results data and contributed in debugging the application, and gathered raw web data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all had significant amount of research on Swift that helped us understand how syntax and functionality transitions are, to our current programming skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of what we came up with (fully functional IOS mobile application) as a result, and though it doesn't involve actual data manipulation nor any data usage, we believe that the idea of BeerMe is significant by itself and will be continued to be better regardless of the event it was made in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that if we wanted to learn a new language, we had to better understand our current language. In another words, it's not the language thats important, its the concept of the language thats important.
We also learned million ways that doesn't work in Swift, and awesome ways that do.
                </p>
