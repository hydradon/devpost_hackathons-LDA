                    This decentualized and comprehensively encrypted market place gaurenteed the safety and privacy of both parties making the health data transaction. We keep all the data on this market place anonymouse. By leveraging the smart contract on Ethereum, this market place will match the transactions posted on the platform smartly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are building the Amazon of health data that offers blockchain enterprise solutions catering to the unique requirements of health blockchain companies. These include decentralised storage and data processing, sustainable data monetisation and encrypted data analysis.
