                    More and more companies start to use deep learning models in their business. Evaluating deep learning models is a challenge.

                    We want to help companies with limited resource and time constraint to evaluate their machine learning models.

                    After companies provide us with their their trained model and sample data, we help them to expand data set by collecting data and using GAN to generate more data sets. Then we run inference and evaluate the quality of the model.

                <p>
                    For this hackathon, we are tackling the most difficult part of this business - using GAN to expand data sets. 
we prototyped serval types of image translation GANs:

                    </a>
                    Torch implementation for learning an image-to-image translation (i.e. pix2pix) without input-output pairs
                </p>
                <p>
                    pix2pix(

                    Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Nets
                </p>
                <p>
                    StarGAN(

                        https://github.com/yunjey/stargan):
                    </a>
                    StarGAN can flexibly translate an input image to any desired target domain using only a single generator and a discriminator
