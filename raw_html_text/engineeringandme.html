                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So essentially we just wanted to make a survey that will tell the participate whether they have an interest towards engineering or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially its just a survey
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by making questions and then we just started using html to make allot of pages with questions and then took css and styled it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really hard to find a way to save and evaluate the selected answers by students. This took allot of time. As well it was hard to use javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn a new language and actually get this to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned CSS, HTML and Java Script all over again after 4 years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EngineeringAndMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it more interactive and try to include machine learning so we can actually see what the computer will predict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ALSO the website we tried to host to is namecheap, but it didn't work
