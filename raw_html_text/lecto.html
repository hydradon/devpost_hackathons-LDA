                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lecto is a live streaming platform for educators. A significant problem students experience, especially those who are self-teaching, is a lack of face-to-face time with their professor. Lecto addresses this need by allowing instructors to explain concepts through a livestream. Students can learn from home and ask questions in the chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feedback for instructors is provided in two ways. First, sentiment analysis is conducted throughout the livestream so instructors can determine comprehension of the material. Next, text analysis is performed at the end of a stream to find the most important subjects for the students.
