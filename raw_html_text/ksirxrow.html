                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retrieves debt contract information by ethereum address from loanscan.io and passes it to a credit rating model that assigns a spread on the dharma dai interest rate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model was prototyped in Excel and implemented in Python, then later fronted with flask to expose a web service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set out to query the blockchain directly for Dharma contracts but the documentation did not contain detail on the features we wanted to use, it was out of date, and dharma.js has been deprecated. In addition, we could not query Dharma contracts with the Etherscan api since the contract source code was not registered with the Etherscan project.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a thing and it sort of works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It never hurts to ask.
                </p>

                    What's next for KSIRXROW
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to build a more sophisticated credit scoring model, act as an underwriting service, and mitigate Sibil attacks.
