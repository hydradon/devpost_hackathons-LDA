                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got inspired by seeing a skill named farm sounds for kids. I loved it and decided to make my own skill for kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this skill, Alexa will whisper a city name and you have to listen to it carefully and reply with the correct name whispered by Alexa. If your answer is correct you will get the ticket to visit the city else if the answer is incorrect, Alexa will give you a hint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using node.js on AWS lambda function and hosted the audio files on amazon s3. Session data is stored in DynamoDb.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had already decided the main idea of the game that is the player will get a ticket to visit different places by answering a question. But the main challenge was deciding what the question would be. It had to be related to the places. Initially, I decided to ask the spelling of a place. But it is not that easy to get the spelling as input from users. kids usually spell words slowly and take pauses and Alexa takes the input after a big pause. I saw that even when I spelled something wrong Alexa used to correct it and the answer became right due to NLP and ML I guess. Hence I decided to use whisper SSML by using which Alexa whispers the place name and the kid have to listen to it carefully and answer the place name whispered by Alexa to get the ticket.

                    This is my first skill where I used the DynamoDb to store session data and amazon s3 to host audio files used in the skill.
