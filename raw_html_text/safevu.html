                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How can we reduce the rate of infectious diseases from being spread around?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an application that allows users to have an ease of mind by mitigating their fear of  contracting infectious diseases during times of epidemic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it is build with python, flask, and swift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    inability to ensure that we are able to track our users properly through GPS and bluetooth with the softwares we are built with. Might require more time to do so despite struggling the entire night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    coming up with a solution that is solving a crucial problem, a problem we keep close to our heart too
this is one of our group members' first hackathon in the U.S YAYYYYY SWAG
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learnt about more ideation, such as the practices and strategies we can adopt to brainstorm for to solve a problem
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SAFEVU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team do recognize some of the challenges in implementing this application to solve the issue of reducing the rate of infectious diseases being spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, in order to solve privacy issue, we decided to provide an unique ID code instead of collecting personal information of the users. However, we do  understand that there are citizens who would still be unwilling to download or enable its location tracking and this would result in our service not being able to fully capture the entire list of potential individuals may be contracted with infectious diseases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we understand that infectious diseases are commonly found in developing countries. However, not all citizens in developing countries own a mobile phone and have proper healthcare systems. However, our team aims to continue working on this to contain the spread of diseases around the world.
