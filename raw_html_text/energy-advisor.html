                    This project was inspired by looking through the Puget Sound Energy website. I saw that they had a service where customers could connect to an energy advisor. However, these services was not as advertised. Thus, I wanted to create a platform where people could better connect with a energy advisor.

                    I learned more about how to learn Android Studio and explored more on the backend side of apps. In addition, this was the first time that I used multiple activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges was the large learning curve, especially when it came to the backend. In addition, my partner left 6 hours into the hackathon, so I was left to complete the app by myself, which is an extremely exhausting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, in the future, with further investment, I can make the app more functional.
