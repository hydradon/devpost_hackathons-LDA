                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After suffering many poor quality video calls, we wondered if we could produce a fun and efficient web-based calling experience without video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jabber replaces video with quirky, customizable face animations to accompany voice calls with your friends. No account necessary, just start calling!

                    How we built it

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We simplified and tracked facial movement and expressions using
                        <a href="https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr" rel="nofollow">
                            clmtracker
                        </a>
                        , an open source library developed by Audun Mathias &Oslash;ygard, based on research by Jason M. Saragih.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We connected users' audio streams using
                        <a href="https://github.com/feross/simple-peer" rel="nofollow">
                            simple-peer
                        </a>
                        , an open source library developed by Feross Aboukhadijeh.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used browser-based features to connect to device cameras and microphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used Firebase, Socket.io, and Express to manage other real-time features and store users' recorded stories.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We do not store any identifying information about users. Video data is not streamed to other users or stored in the database. Audio data is streamed to other users in the chatroom, but not stored in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clmtracker model uses a support vector machine on a 20-factor principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the locations of the facial features from camera frames. To display the face graphics, we store 71 points that represent facial features as well as 20 parameters for the model. The PCA processes decomposes the image information to a level where we believe that it cannot be reversed to identify the original user.
