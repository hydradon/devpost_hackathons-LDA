                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many businesswomen have busy lives filled with stress from outside and inside their work lives, and outfitting properly isn't a priority. However, their presentation is important in meetings with client and bosses, so this program can effectively and efficiently promote and assist women in the work field.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows people to enter the type of shirt/top and its color, and returns fashionably advice on what to wear for bottoms and shoes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the JGrasp program to build this program using JavaScript, and made a driver class with all the code inside it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was finalizing our topic mainly because of limited ability and knowledge of computer science, because we are a team of novices who have only been programming for a year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make a working program that could function usefully for everyday people.

                <p>
                    We learned how to further our skills in JavaScript, and definitely more about team-building and cooperation.
