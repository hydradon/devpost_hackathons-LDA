                    Have you ever wanted to survey your house but don't want to scroll through hours of video recordings? Now you can!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With MotionImage, you can just scroll see the pictures to get a quick overview what you are missing while you are asleep or while you are at work.

                <p>
                    MotionImage is built with a Raspberry along with a camera. The software for motion detection is built using pygame. The core motion detection mechanics is looking at the difference in pixel values over time to not only detect the motion but also the source of the motion.

                    Some challenges that I ran into are filtering out background noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was proud that I was able to successfully develop a fully operational standalone device that accomplish this task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enhanced my skills with pygame, and I gained great insights on the raspberry pi API and basic circuitry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step for MotionImage is a better motion detector along with a more selective filtering process.
