                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As investors ourselves, we were inspired to create a tool that people can use to determine if a specific stock would be a good buy to hold for the foreseeable future (5 years +) following the Buffett-Munger philosophy and hand-picking key ratios and data in line with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives an overview of a specific stock with plenty of data visualization that otherwise may have confused and intimidated beginners when attempting to evaluate stocks on a pure number method. There's also a candlestick chart at the end for the technical analyst :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using a mix of reactJS, chartJS, react-bootstrap and plenty of API calls to gather financial data from companies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because most of us haven't used chartJS, the hardest part was actually creating the charts and properly visualizing the data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall work that we made and the final product as well as the challenges we managed to overcome
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have been working in teams for as long as we can remember, but I think we learned a lot to cover each other&rsquo;s weakness to some degree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for stock-valuation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely planning to continue this over the next year and continue improving the UI and it is a tool I am planning to be able to use in picking my stocks and screening before reading its Form 10-K!
