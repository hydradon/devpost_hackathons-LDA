                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think it's important for kids to learn about mental health as well as physical health, so they know how to take care of themselves and others.

                    A 2D interactive storytelling game that teaches kids about the importance of physical and mental health through short scenarios between characters.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the game engine Unity and the programming language C# to build it. We also used visual studio as a text editor for the code. We made hand drawn assets by using a mobile drawing app and a stylus. For audio we used SoundTrap.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Biting off more than we could chew. We often overestimated how much we could learn about Unity in a short amount of time.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned about using Unity as a tool, something we've never used before.
