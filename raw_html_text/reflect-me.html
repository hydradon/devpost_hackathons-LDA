                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's increasingly technologically-driven era, we find ourselves spending more and more of our day in the digital realm. This makes it increasingly important to be aware of how we spend our time online. Enter reflect.me. Our philosophy is that the more data you have about your digital usage, the more informed your digital decisions become.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reflect.me is the aggregate of your digital footprint. With visualized data on how you spend your time on apps from Spotify to Github, reflect.me is intended to be an objective presentation of information that encourages self-reflection on how you spend time with technology. We believe that data is more compelling with words. It is up to you to decide how you feel about the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reflect.me is composed of a backend of Python and Google Firebase along with Flask as our web framework. The front end was built with React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Our biggest challenge was understanding how authentication works for all of our different APIs. None of us had any experience with it before. 
*Additionally, many APIs, even from well-established online services, proved to be limited at times. For example, many YouTube metrics such as "total watch time" are not publicly available, so we had to improvise and make do with what was available to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Successfully connecting the client and server sides together.
*Creating an aesthetically pleasing data visualization with interesting javascript frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Client-side authentication with Firebase
*Flask
*RESTful API calls
*Creating data visualizations through React + D3
