                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really love Artificial Intelligence and all that comes with it, therefore bettering the world using these as tools was the next obvious step
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are building the future of baking. Transactions made easy. Just snap a picture of the receiver and we will send them the money for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the Microsoft Cognitive Services for the Face Detection. With the data we got from that, we would train our Convolutional Neural Network and further use it to recognize both the sender and the receiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we started with a Deep Neural Network but soon we run into problems. We wanted to use it as it provided us with an easy way to deploy as we did not need to trouble ourselves with the feature selection. We ended up training our Convolutional Neural Network based on the features mined from the Microsoft API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The face recognition runs better than expected at even small training data. We believe the execution will only improve as the sets will grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that great things can be accomplished just by starting with a dream and 36 hours.
