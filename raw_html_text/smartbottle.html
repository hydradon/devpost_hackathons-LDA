                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted improve the daily lives of our society and third world countries. We realized that a lot of fatigue is caused by dehydration, and that it is easily improved by drinking more water. However, we often forget as our lives get very busy, but what we don't forget to do is to check our phones every minute! We wanted to incorporate a healthier habit with our phones, to help remind us to drink enough water every day. We also realized the importance of drinking clean, and pure water, and that some people in this world are not priveledged enough to have pure water. Our product promotes the user's physical well being, and shows them how to drink different, and also raises awareness of the impure water that many individuals have to drink.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bottle senses the resistance of the water, and uses this data to determine whether or not the water is safe to drink. The bottle also senses the change in mass of the bottle to determine your daily intake. Using this data, it will send a text message to your phone to remind you to drink water, and if the water you are about to drink is safe or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The resistance sensor is essentially a voltage divider. The voltage produced from the Photon is split between a known resistance and the water of unknown resistance. The voltage of the water, the total voltage and the resistance from one resistor is known. From there, the program conducts multiple trials and chooses the most accurate data to calculate its resistance. The pressure sensor senses the pressure placed and changes the resistance accordingly. Its voltage is then recorded and processed within our code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The changes in pressure and resistance that are sent from the sensors first passes through the Google Cloud Platform publisher/subscriber API. Then they proceed to a python script which will send the data back to the Google Cloud, but this time to the datastore, which, optimally, would use machine learning to analyze the data and figure out the information to return. This processed information would then be sent to a Twilio script in order to be sent as a text message to the designated individual's phone number.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was learning the new material is a short amount of time. A lot of the concepts were quite foreign to us, and learning these new concepts took a lot of time and effort. Furthermore, there were several issues and inconsistancies with our circuits and sensors. They were quite time consuming to fix, and required us to trace back our circuits and modify the program. However, these challenges were more than enjoyable to overcome and an amazing learning opportunity for our entire team.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is firstly proud of finishing the entire project while using foreign software and hardware. It was the first time we used Google Cloud Platform and the Particle Photon, and a lot of the programming was quite foreign. The project required a lot of intricate design and programming. There were a lot of small and complex parts of the project, and given the time restraint and minor malfunctions, it was very difficult to accomplish everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team developed our previous knowledge in programming and sensors. We learned how to integrate things with Google Cloud Platform, how to operate Twilio, and how setup and use a Particle Photon. Our team also learned about the engineering process of design, prototyping and pitching a novel idea. This improves what to expect if any of us decide to do a startup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartBottle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to develop an app that sends notifications to your phone instead of texts, and use machine learning to monitor your water intake, and recommend how you should incorporate it in your life. More importantly, we want to integrate the electrical components within the bottle instead of the external prototype we have. We imagine the force sensor sill being at the bottom, and a more slick design for the resistance sensor.
