                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier to shop for things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses google vision api to analyze photos and redirect users to similar shopping options online
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used google vision api, etsy api, and scrapped the amazon website while also using python flask javascript and html + css for front end
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to scrape amazon because the api wasn't available to us as developers. Instead, we needed to use beautiful soup to scrape the actual site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I was able to integrate so many hard-to-use tools together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we only knew the basics of flask, javascript, and html before we began development. We were able to learn a lot about machine learning analysis and the actual use of apis.
                </p>

                    What's next for HackShop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continue expanding and potentially integrating the amazon api when an api key becomes available to us as developers
