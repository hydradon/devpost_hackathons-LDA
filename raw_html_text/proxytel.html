                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last night we ordered food from a new food delivery startup (which we prefer not to name). To our surprise, the driver knew our actual phone number. Usually in such application (like Uber, Lyft, Doordash), both customer's phone number and the driver phone number is masked from each other to increase safety and privacy of both the parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first we were mildly infuriated that this company didn't care about its user's privacy. But almost immediately, we realized that for a small business, it's non trivial to implement such a masking solution, handling the exchange, load balancing. So we thought we can solve this problem since it will impact a large category of small businesses such as: Delivery, Sites like CraigList where users are hesitant to expose their phone number, home showing websites such as zillow, trulia etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ProxyTel allows you to quickly integrate masked phone numbers very easily in your app. All you have to do is come and register your app, after which:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You are given a URL: Simply send a REST request on the url
                        <code>
                            /connection/start/&lt;yourCustomerPhoneNumber&gt;&lt;yourDriverPhoneNumber&gt;/&lt;orderID&gt;
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That's it, we will give you two virtualPhone numbers: one you can give to your customer and other to your driver. And they can easily contact each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once this transaction is complete simply send another request to stop:
                        <code>
                            /connection/stop/&lt;yourCustomerPhoneNumber&gt;&lt;yourDriverPhoneNumber&gt;/&lt;orderID&gt;
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here
                        <code>
                            orderID
                        </code>
                        can be any sort of reference number to distinguish one business transaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What's more? You don't have to manage any phone number! We will do that balancing, based on your traffic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Still want more? Well, we will

                            phone recordings to text
                        </strong>
                        and send all to

                            IBM-Watson for sentimental analysis

                        for any harsh conversations which will be flagged to you to take further action.

                    <li>
                        Here, driver can be any other kind of agent. For example, in case of showing homes, it can be the realtor. In apps which connect buyers and sellers (like CraigList), the agent can be the seller.

                    How we built it

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We used Nexemo's super friendly API's handle all the phone calls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Nexemo's API, we generate virtual numbers on the fly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then we keep a record of who wants to contact who under what reference number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever we receive a call from either party, we make sure that the
                        <code>
                            connection
                        </code>
                        is not expired and then we connect both of them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the conversation is over, we fetch the recording from Nexemo and use IBM Watson to transcribe it into text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then send the transcribed text again to Watson for tone analysis. This way we can tell if any conversation was rude and flag it for review.
