                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constant sound. The noise and sound generated by planes, helicopters, trains, cars and much more inspired us to create this web-app.
We wanted to make a change and help others. For instance, when buying a house, many people are not able to truly evaluate how bad noise pollution is or isn't. This is what we wanted to change and why we decided to create a web-app that suggests possible factors of noise pollution of a given address. 
After having bought a house, my family realized all too late that it was surrounded by sound pollution from airplanes. Never again will anyone have to make the same mistake again. That is our inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web-application takes a location from you, the user, to our server where we use our algorithms and massive database to calculate the distance from known sources of noise pollution, mainly airports and helipads. The closer you are to one of these sources or the low flight routes highlighted by red lines, the more noise pollution you should expect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bought the domain using Domain.com and hosted it using Google Cloud Services' App Engine. We built the server using Node.js and various npm modules. We built the website using HTML, CSS, and javascript. We used JQuery and leafletjs to build the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time building a dynamic website and our first time using google services. The first challenge we ran into was how to host our website. It was also our first time using GitHub on a group project. The second challenge we ran into was coordinating our code and joining different parts together. Possibly the biggest challenge we ran into was making the algorithm work worldwide. Finding the closest airports was hard at first, but after prototyping with airports in Toronto we managed to come up with a fast and reliable way to expand our code.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud of the fact that we built something useful in 36 hours. This was the first hackathon experience for all of us and we are extremely proud that we were able to make our ideas into a reality despite the time limits and difficulties along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so many things during our experience at Hack the North. To begin with, we learned many new programming skills such as Google Cloud Services and Node.js. We also learned how to keep a positive team ethic and how to work together no matter how difficult or stressful it got.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HushedHomes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot is planned for HushedHomes. To beginning with, we want to expand our collection of noise sources by adding things like railroads, highways, live events, and ongoing construction. Furthermore, we would like to add a user participation system, this would allow users to submit where they think is noisy. This would allow us to build live maps of every city and increase precision by giving us data to analyse.
