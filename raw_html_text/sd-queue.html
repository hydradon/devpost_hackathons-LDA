                <p>
                    Lines are the worst. People waste so much time waiting in a long line.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Queue allow people to queue virtually instead of waiting in a physical line. It can also show people how much time they still need to wait and their positions in the line. When it is two people ahead, Queue will send out text message to notify users. People can also learn about the event position and the busy hours of the event so that they can make better decision. For event organizers, they can post the most updated information on Queue and promote their services to the users.

                <p>
                    We can occupy machine learning to predict the waiting time and queue trend to make the predicted waiting time more accurate. We can also add more social aspect so that users can interact with each other. For example, people can post their interest on it and Queue can match the interest for different people. There are also promising economic benefits in Queue.
