                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tabletop game is becoming more and more popular recently, it plays as a great role in communicating with others, making friends and enriching leisure life. There are several bluffing and logic game, such as the Mafia and the Werewolves. These two games are very popular in the world, and there are many apps of them. For example, a popular online Werewolf app in China achieved over 1 million downloads in 2 months. There is a similar kind and very interesting game called the Resistance. A brief rule introduction of the Resistance is listed in rule.pdf, player take turns to give a speech, and good guy try to use logic to find the bad persons.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made app can take place of the real card. What&rsquo;s more, our app using Amazon Web Service to create room and join an existing room. Player can see they role and vote through our apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend in built on AWS with nodejs. The frontend is built with ionic with html/css/javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ionic is hard to learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <h2>
                    What's next for Resistance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future goal is make a fully online version of the Resistance. It is a logic and speaking game, so we don't need to play in person. It can be played even by typing words. GPS can be used to find people nearby, we can also invite people to join a game. We may try add some in-APP purchase function. ie. People can buy "extend time" card to extend their speech time from 60s to 120s; can buy "character card" if they very want to play a certain role. People can use camera when it is their turn to give a speech.
