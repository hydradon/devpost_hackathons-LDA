                    Quidditch is a hot new sport that is taking over the world. With its unique style of play, no web apps currently exist to cater to the sport's needs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuidScore primarily streamlines the process of scorekeeping so that any scorekeeper at a tournament can scorekeep a game simultaneously and have it all automatically linked together . It also allows the scorekeeper to keep track of the player who scored and comments regarding play -potential for stat-tracking. It also can be used as player check-in app at tournaments for it stores all the tournaments, games and teams in a database.
                </p>

                    What's next for QuidScore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quidditch is a growing niche market and there is great potential for its use in stat-tracking which opens doors to other ideas for apps. QuidScore could very much be the beginning of something like enterprise software but for the entire community of quidditch.
