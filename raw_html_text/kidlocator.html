                    The application is inspired by 3d location in buildings. The problem it is trying to solve is children going missing in malls. Our idea is based on facial recognition and on surveillance cameras from the stores inside a mall. The full scenarios is the following. A parent lost his kid in the mall, he goes to the mall administration talks with the administrator. The administrator opens up the website with the app, and uploads a picture from the parent that contains the child's face. Then the application scans the picture, saves the face and then starts matching the face with snaps from the surveillance cameras inside the mall. When the app finds the face it returns the camera reference and a store reference so the parent can go find his kid.
