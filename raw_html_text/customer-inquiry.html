                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a bot for my company but people didn't really use it much because it had limitations to how many question it can respond to.
                </p>

                    problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chat bots don&rsquo;t always know the right answer to give to users.
However, they are good at learning, i.e. if you provided them with the answer to the asked question, they will always respond correctly to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, we are creating a system called Human assisted bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Bot monitoring tool that will capture user questions to the bot and send them to a slack channel. Any time, the bot does not have an answer, it will ping a human in slack and then the human will provide the answer to the bot. In turn, the bot will respond to the user.
