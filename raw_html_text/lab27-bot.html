                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The negative comments regarding Vodafone's customer service on facebook and other social media
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a bot integrated in Facebook Messenger app that people can ask different questions regarding Vodafone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Python, using the Eclipse ide. We used machine learning to train the bot into answering relevant questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Facebook. Aparently, we need validation from them to make the bot public and the whole process might take several weeks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a product that might solve a real problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about machine learning and what it can do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lab27 Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to enchance the experience of the costumers by making the bot more "humane" and by adding more features such as finding the closest Vodafone shop using google maps.
