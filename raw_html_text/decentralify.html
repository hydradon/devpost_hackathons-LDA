                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are incredible automation tools in web2 world that allow you to create continuous integration and deployment pipelines for your applications. We thought: why not creating a decentralized pipeline so that the application build process and its hosting will rely only on decentralized services?

                <p>
                    Takes a GitHub repo with an app (VuePress, Hugo, Gatsby, etc), builds it on iExec, uploads the assets to IPFS and provides a simple domain via FISSION.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We took the Netlify

                        build-image
                    </a>
                    and added functionality to be compatible with iExec and
                    <code>
                        ipfs-deploy
                    </code>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        iExec onboarding is not easy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        iExec Kovan marketplace can be harsh at times (e.g. no available workers for XS tasks).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a working build and deployment pipeline with has out-of-the-box support for dozens of static site builders using mostly web3 and some web2 technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It's technically possible to build using web3 stack!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's still quite challenging to use decentralized compute platforms like iExec as the onboarding is complicated and there's not enough workers in the pool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Infura IPFS gateway is not stable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's still lack of tooling and documentation for web3 services.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What's next for Decentralify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue refining and deploying it to the iExec marketplace once it's ready. We'll also be talking to FISSION and see if we can integrate it with their toolchain.
