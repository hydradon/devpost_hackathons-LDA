                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stuck trying to find an idea of a game to build, and began trying to make a snake game.  After one member broke off, we found that 2048 was in general not as hard to program and hardly ever played as a multiplayer game.  After attempting to make an imessage game, we decided to switch to an online battle royale style game built in Node.js, implementing a multiplayer mode for the classic 2048 game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game has its own server, which can host rooms, each of which acts as an independent multiplayer game.  All of the boards are visible to each other, with the player's board shown in the upper left.  When pieces are combined ojn one board, an extra piece is added to another board as an "attack".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript with Node.js to build the game.  We first programmed our own version of the 2048 game, then built an online server in Node to host the game.  Sockets are used to send information between players within the room, to allow for multiplayer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge we ran into was making the sockets work.  It was incredibly hard to control the socket ids and broadcast which player was sending data to move the opponent pieces.  Also, hosting the rooms gave us some issues, as previously created rooms would be added to the local storage when they had not previously been created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to make an online server as well as our own version of 2048, and make a project that nobody has even attempted before.  There is no battle royale mode for 2048 and we believe this project is truly a unique perspective on the ubiquitous game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant part of what we learned was in Node.js.  Only one member had used javascript before, with almost no experience in Node.  We all worked together to learn the framework for Node.js and find a method by which to host the  website.  We also learned how to program keypresses based on arrow keys, and learned the logic behind the movement of the 2048 board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2048 Battle Royale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to polish the game, adding animations similar to those of the real 2048, and make an iOS implementation of the game, similar to the one earlier imagined in the imessage game idea.  This could help make a more user friendly experience,  as it would allow for swiping on the screen for movement.  Eventually, we hope this could be published as an original online game.
