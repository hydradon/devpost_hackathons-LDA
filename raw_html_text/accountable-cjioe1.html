                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two types of people in the world: those who are always responsible and always on top of their things, and those who are not. To be honest, I used to fall into the latter category. When I was young, whenever my parents left me alone for any period of time, I would never complete any of the tasks they've assigned me until the last minute--meaning none of the things I did managed to complete were done well--unless my parents called me every 10 minutes, on the dot. This is where Accountable comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accountable allows parents to remotely monitor their child while teaching them how to better manage their time. After the parent creates a to-do list, the child can begin working, with the timer counting down the current task. After each task's time ends, the child is prompted to answer whether or not they have completed the task. If the device has texting capabilities and the functionality is turned on, then the app will automatically generate and send a text message to the parent, updating them on whether or not the child has or has not completed the task. To further promote discipline, the app requires a passcode to be entered by the parent when saving a to-do list, editing an existing to-do list, and exiting out of a to-do list that is currently counting down.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A huge obstacle I ran into was storing information to CoreData. Since each to-do list has its own corresponding list of tasks, I had to figure out a way to form that relationship. At first, I researched how to save an NSArray CoreData, but found that the solution was to create a one-to-many relationship.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the user interface of the application, because it uses a color scheme that is both bright and colorful. The application is easy to learn and quick to use, making it accessible to everyone, no matter their technological background.

                <h2>
                    Whats next for Accountable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the second version of Accountable, I want to connect my application to Firebase. This means users can create either a parent or child account. This means other than sending text messages, the parents can be notified via push notification when a task is completed.
