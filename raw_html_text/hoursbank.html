                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HourBank was originally pitched to us during a presentation of many community projects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mode of sending requests for labor and trading time spent on labors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a single-paged javascript app that manages the data inside localStorage; the data model was designed in such a way to be compatible with SQL databases -- localStorage was used here to make it easier to deploy at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled a lot with creating the database to store information about people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making everything working in such a short time span
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with servers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoursBank
                </h2>
                <p>
