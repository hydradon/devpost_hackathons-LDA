                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook has a ton of travel based groups with a lot of participation. One common problem people have is how to plan a trip or how exactly they can ask for help. In case they post queries on groups, the suggestions are difficult to relate to each other and hence communities together can't really help and the person in need is not able to appreciate the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conversations are hard to initiate and when they are not meaningful people lose interest. When someone is in need they generally expect help which can really help them out. Facebook has many travel groups and there are people who take solo trips, work trips and usually get confused in terms of what to do in the evening or in free time. Even after getting suggestions to two good places, planning a trip is a task!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea which led us to discover the possibility to develop such an application actually came from a real-life incident when one of us wanted to visit some places in a distant state and had to suffer a lot in finding the optimal route to experience a pleasant and hassle-free travel and looking at all the suggestions I got from the community was a task in itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How Travelza bring community closer?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conversations are hard to initiate and when they are not meaningful people lose interest. When someone is in need they generally expect help which can really help them out. Facebook has many travel groups and there are people who take solo trips, work trips and usually get confused in terms of what to do. As mentioned previously our app solves that hurdle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it can help communities is, it gives a way for people to share a planed trip and take suggestions on what can be improved, are they missing out a good place, what suggestions other have in a well oriented manner and everyone can collaborate together thereby increasing engagement and keeping the whole conversation meaningful.

                <p>
                    A restless zeal to solve this problem made us think out of the box and gave wings to our imagination. We tried several ways to make it happen and this long journey thankfully brought out the best possible outcome.

                    We developed the iOS App using Swift, Google Maps SDK, Google Maps API, Foursquare and yelp api and branch SDK for deep linking.
The server side is all coded using python over Django.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application and the server uses Rest apis to communicate.

                    We used Facebook login and also profile information! 
We will eventually add Facebook friends and group responses directly into the app.

                <p>
                    At the initial phase, several architectural issues tried to catch our progress by the neck. Our focus was to make a very flexible and robust application that actually works the way we intended it to be.
From selection of the best way to find the shortest path and all the way to choose among several color themes to make it more expressive &amp; other inmuerable small hurdles were faced and all were eradicated successfully too.

                <p>
                    A lot of thought process went on how groups can use it securely. How people can maintain their own trips and also can get a collaboration. How others can contribute to the trip in a meaningful way!

                <p>
                    We have done our best to solve a real life problem, which I am sure would have been faced by most of the people who wished to visit several places in certain amount of time but ended up in wasting a lot of time in planning rather than enjoying the visit.
I am quite positive about its use case and I believe that there are several people like me out there who will surely find it incredibly useful.

                    What we learned?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have gathered some of the best experiences while developing this application as it taught me the real lesson about how technology impacts our daily lives and how we can use it to make a better world. Before that we knew that somewhere it is true that technology does has such potential but when we used it for ourself and ended up in making a real world problem solving application, it was a eureka moment for all of us! There were several moments which made us grow technologically and professionally.

Android is also in the process as communities are cross platform!
