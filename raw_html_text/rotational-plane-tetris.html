                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you have an air traffic control tower in the center, and runways positioned radially outward from it. Planes will come flying in from different directions and you have to rotate the circle of runways to catch them with a runway that doesn't already have a plane on it. If a plane lands on a runway that already has a plane on it, you lose. Each plane will spend a certain amount of time on the runway and then take off again in whatever direction it's facing, you need to make sure it doesn't fly off into another plane or that's game over as well.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All built from scratch in Java
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a bad cold and did more sleeping than programming, so I didn't actually get a lot implemented in the game, but I do like the concept and might continue working on it
