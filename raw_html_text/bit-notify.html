                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the lack of notification platforms for streamers streaming on twitch who were willing to accept Bitcoin. Our application attempts to ameliorate the blatant need for the decentralization of donations on platforms such as the streaming platforms twitch and mixer by allowing streamers to accept BTC without sacrificing the notification the would otherwise receive if sticking with Paypal. Moreover, our app allows streamers to use another avenue for accepting donations such as cryptocurrency seamlessly instead of relying on platforms such as Paypal which have very few restrictions against "charge backs": an occurrence all entertainers are all too familiar with on streaming platforms.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app sends the user or streamer a message through their email using the Sparkpost API with which they can then integrate into their live feed to acknowledge the sender and the amount of currency they have sent.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website/application by accessing the blockchain API and aggregating all of the transactions the user receives within a time frame and then determining their net gain and the sender of the funds- in order to provide relevant information to the user.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into was the lack of documentation on the blockchain API and the lack of test cases.

                    We finished.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything about blockchain, and how the technology actually functions.

                    What's next for bitAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably facilitate the transference of BTC through our website one way or another.
