                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As 3 minority women who constantly take CTA transportation, we wanted to create something to help the voiceless express what they went through to potentially decrease the amount of sexual harassment.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The forum was the hardest thing to create since we had to use Javascript, CSS, and HTML and we had a few errors with the input for the fields.

                    We managed to complete this simple, yet functional website and it runs smoothly.
