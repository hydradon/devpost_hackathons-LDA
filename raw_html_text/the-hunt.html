                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide law enforcement with a quicker and easier first respondent. After running into problems with programming the drone, we decided to have the drone run an autonomous flight using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone is programmed to run a pre-determined flight. The drone can move up, down, left and right on its own as well as performing a couple of tricks like flipping and waving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript to program the flight and command line to run the flight to the drone via Wifi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having troubles accessing the video feed and programming the drone to recognize faces and objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to start from scratch and learn how to program a drone without any knowledge of drones. Even though we weren't able to execute our idea, we were able to put on a show using the capabilities of the drone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program a drone as well as the commands that program the drone to execute an action. We learned how the drone works and how to hack a drone to run an autonomous flight on its own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Hunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next task for The Hunt would be to program the facial recognition software, a trigger that would allow the drone to takeoff, and a sensor to avoid obstacles in its way.
