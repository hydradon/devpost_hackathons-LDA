                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to experiment with Machine Learning and wanted to do a project that would actually have an impact on people's lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This reads in sign language through a camera and prints out the corresponding English letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained a dataset using Google Cloud AutoML and then did all of the backend in python to make sure the computer vision library would work well with our ML algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was trying to use OpenCV to work in python with our ML algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to have our project recognize hand signs and being able to output the correct letter in english.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using the Google cloud framework, and we gained a better understanding of computer vision in python.
                </p>

                    What's next for SignLanguageTranslator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bring this application to mobile devices so that it would be very user-friendly.
