                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People love automated user experience. They should just be able to define exactly what they want to do when they want to do it. This holds true for exchanging assets on Ethereum. Rather than having to manually monitor markets and react to changing conditions, we would much rather pre-define what we want to do in certain scenarios before they actually happen. As of today, there are only a few services that offer such automated services to users and if they do, they simply mimicking the traditional ones from the centralized exchange world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to take ERC20 trading to a new level and offer users to define cross-asset, conditional orders (limit, stop loss, etc), where they can define a condition that must be met for an asset pair A and if this holds true, exchange a completely different pair B. This way, users can automate more complex trading strategies such as conditional trading based on correlations between various assets.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application enables cross token conditional limit orders, stop losses, etc for ERC20 tokens on decentralized exchanges. Users can define a pre-defined condition like if Price of ETH =&gt; 200 DAI and then conduct a completely different action such as sell WBTC for ETH on Kyber. Rather than having to monitor changing market conditions continuously, users can simply mint an execution claim and have a network of relayers execute the transaction on the user's behalf in the future. Built on the gelato protocol.
