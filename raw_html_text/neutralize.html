                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When building Neutralize, we were inspired by a 2011 study revealing that women are less likely to apply for jobs whose descriptions include certain &ldquo;male&rdquo; words like &ldquo;dominate,&rdquo; &ldquo;challenge,&rdquo; or &ldquo;independent.&rdquo; The authors of the study theorized that when female potential applicants view descriptions that use primarily male language, they can&rsquo;t &ldquo;see themselves&rdquo; in the position and don&rsquo;t apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team realized that by making a tool to generate job descriptions oriented towards women, we could contribute towards workplace gender diversity by &ldquo;widening the pipeline.&rdquo; Later, we realized that certain industries&mdash;like nursing&mdash;tend to be female-dominated, so we added functionality to generate text biased towards men.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neutralize is a web app that detects and suggests replacements for gender-biased language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python with Flask to build out the web application. For the bar animations, we used jqmeter, a JavaScript plugin. The frontend uses bootstrap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flow: when a user inputs text for analysis, we execute a python function to cross-reference the words in the text with a list of words that studies show appeal more to men or women. We calculate a &ldquo;gender bias&rdquo; score based on the percentage of &ldquo;gendered words&rdquo; out of the whole text. Our suggestion tool then uses a replacement algorithm to generate text with a gender bias more geared towards the female or male gender. The suggestions are rescored to ensure that an improvement has been made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge came at the beginning of Hack the North. Initially, our team planned to build a mobile app to facilitate facebook purchases. However, we struggled to commit to the project. Though it was technically impressive and used several &ldquo;prize&rdquo; APIs, we didn&rsquo;t feel that it advanced social good. After we committed to building Neutralizer, our team dynamic shifted in a positive way, because we all believe in the social importance of gender diversity in the workplace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on a team with 3 other people, finishing a project that has a social impact, and pivoting effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to pivot between ideas very quickly. We also had a crucial &ldquo;team epiphany&rdquo; that the point of a hackathon is to build something important, not to win prizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Neutralize
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re excited to release Neutralize to the public, so that people become aware of the potential biases in their everyday language. We hope that Neutralize will be widely adopted as a tool for modifying job descriptions, and become a piece of the solution to the lack of gender diversity in many industries, including tech.
