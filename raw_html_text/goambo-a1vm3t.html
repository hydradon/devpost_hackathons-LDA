                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients are dying around the world due to the inefficiency, exorbitant costs, and shortage of ambulance services. Emergency medical services should be reliable, affordable and quick. Patients should not need to wait more than 10 minutes to even get to the hospital
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoAmbo is an emergency ambulance service. We combine the efficiency of a cab service like Uber/Ola with the necessity of a sound ambulance service in developing country like India. Any person in need of emergency services can simply click a button on the app, and our trained drivers will arrive within minutes to take you to the nearest hospital, using GPS optimization
                </p>

                <p>
                    We successfully created an app prototype using Adobe Illustrator and a software called Invision. Through this, we were able to create the various screens that would show up on a mobile device and their respective sequences based on what is clicked. Additionally, we were able to create a streamlined online web service that is actually up and running using Java Script. Lastly, we were able to come up with a primary business plan for the company GoAmbo, and how we'd proceed with startup capital
