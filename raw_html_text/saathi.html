                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology today plays a very important part of our lives, and home automation is taking it a step further by integrating it into our everyday chores.
We came up with this hack as 
We came up with this hack as home automation is not only a technological breakthrough in itself but is also an extremely useful accessibility tool. It makes it convenient for the disabled to control various appliances around their house without asking for help. This will also be very useful in hospitals where patients are bedridden and are unable to control the appliances in the room around them. Similarly, another place where this would be a great tool are old age homes as it would be extremely convenient for the elderly to be able to interact with the appliances without having to get up and move around for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    S.A.A.T.H.I demonstrates a voice controlled home automation system which can interact with any appliance, but for the sake of the hack we have demonstrated this using LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to go the web application route because it allowed access to the most number of devices. We leveraged Raspberry Pi's ability to interface with pretty much any circuitry through its GPIO pins and act too as a web server at the same time. The web server is setup using NodeJS which also controls the GPIO pins. The client runs an instance of Web Speech API which translates users' commands to text. This text is cleaned, parsed and sent to the pi for proper response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being beginners in the field of web development, we initially had some trouble implementing the API for voice recognition. Parsing the users speech also was tricky as we had to look for the right trigger words to generate the appropriate response. And finally we ran into issues while controlling the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi which controlled the LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, we are proud of the entire hack in itself as most of us were beginners in the field of web development and also had very limited exposure to working with the raspberry pi. Thus, we were quite happy once the application was functional as we started right from learning parts of javascript, web servers, sockets and controlling GPIO pins and then implementing all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack was an extremely enriching experience as not only did we learn about javascript, web servers, sockets and usage of the raspberry pi and implement these in our hack, but also, the challenges we ran into further polished our skills in the same. And like we do in every hackathon, it taught us to always have a backup plan and think on our feet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for S.A.A.T.H.I.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, the application is demonstrated using LEDs, so the path forward for S.A.A.T.H.I. would be to demonstrate this using actual appliances. Further, we could also implement more features on voice commands like calling and testing to name a few.
