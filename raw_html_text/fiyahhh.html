                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch is a place where many content creators come and share the content creation live with the community!
However, Twitch live content still has a heavy bias towards Gaming content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided that want to help bring more of the twitch community to creative content streamers! 
The biggest issue is the fact that its hard to interact with the community as a creative streamers. Creative streamers can get easily caught up in their content creation that the community is typically left out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore we embarked on an application to mitigate this problem!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project:Circle is a poll that enables the viewers to engage with their favorite artists and musicians like they've never been able to do before. The UI has a native feel to give a sense familiarity to the viewers. The streamer has the ability to brand their own poll by using Twitch's brand new extended color palette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The poll has three options: predefined, fill-in, and color picker. The predefined poll is your typical poll that is open for any type of streamer (gamer, artist, musician, etc.). The fill-in poll is a Reddit style poll using a similar upvote concept. This is great for musicians who want to ask their viewers to decide the next song. The color picker brings up a super minimal color palette from Material Design. This is great for artists who want to engage their viewers to decide what color their artwork should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to top it all off, Project:Circle utilizes historical data. Not only can viewers see the current poll, but they can also see past polls. This is great for viewers who want to get a general context on what has happened during the stream. For artists who want to crowdsource their creative process from ideation to final, the viewer can see the documented decisions up to date.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Figma to design and prototype. We referenced the new brand expression website (
                    <a href="https://brand.twitch.tv/expression/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://brand.twitch.tv/expression/
                    </a>
                    ) to reference the colors.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our teammates left haha. Troy is a new junior full-stack. Justin is a designer. Thus, we didn't have the experience and capacity to complete the task at hand.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed a working prototype!
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes things don't always go according to plan. We just needed to keep chugging along to get the job done as best we can!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to develop code to create a working application. This will be coded using modern framework technologies such as React, and express as well as mongoDB for the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to bring more features to this extension as well! The main goal was to shorten the gap between the community and the streamer! With this in mind, we plan on incorporating things like tts comments, and machine learning algorithms to assess the community chat and add some interactions based on the information collected!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we want to deploy the working application to the twitch community for all to use! We embarked on this hackathon to explore the world of building twitch extensions, and we still plan on reaching that goal!
