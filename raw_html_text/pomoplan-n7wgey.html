                    HackDuke 2018 Project: Pomodora Planner aimed at individuals with difficulties managing time. Uses a Pomodoro Timer for tasks, proven to be effective at managing time. For more information on the Pomodoro timer visit:

                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This app was made for people with difficulties scheduling and managing time, such as those with ADD/ADHD.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It works by having the user input their tasks, how long it takes, and the associated location they wish to complete the task at. Then the user inputs their free time for the day in the second tab in the bottom-bar menu, to which an algorithm is then run to fit all of the tasks into the inputted free times. When the time arrives for the task to begin, a Pomodoro Scheduler will start with 25 minutes of working and 5 minutes of work.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used Java and Android Studio
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use Android Studio was definitely a big challenge. There were mismatches between our APIs causing errors and a big challenge was changing views when the user clicked on the bottom-bar menu. We were not able to implement the Pomodora Timer due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We refreshed our Java skills and learnt how to user/navigate through Android Studio! The ability to input tasks and have them display on the screen in rows with multiple sections along with the ability to change views are our biggest accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What's next
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Implement the Pomodora Timer, fix the UI, have the ability to delete tasks, add priority to tasks, and allow the user to input the places they wish to work.
