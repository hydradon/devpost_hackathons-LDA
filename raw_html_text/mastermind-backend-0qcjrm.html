                    The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's play Mastermind! If you've never played Mastermind, take a few minutes to check out the rules here:
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Gameplay_and_rules" rel="nofollow">
                        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Gameplay_and_rules
                    </a>
                    . We would also recommend taking some time to play a game or two with your teammates to get a better understanding of the game. The typical Mastermind game is played with 4 colors and 4 positions; however, for our challenge, we will be using 8 colors and 8 positions. Our engineering challenge will revolve around building different parts of this game.
There will be three separate challenges to this task. Any task by itself is sufficient for a hackathon submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenge One: Backend Implementation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are you a backend architect that can spin up robust, well tested APIs? Then this may be the challenge for you. Build an API that you can play Mastermind with! The language and stack you choose to use is it up to you. The
endpoints you create and the structure are up to you but it must be able to support multiple users hitting the API at the same time playing different games of Mastermind and the API must respond with the proper number of exact and near matches for every guess.
To go a bit further, try implementing a multiplayer component to the game where a user can hit an endpoint to create a game and wait for another user to join the same game. Once the second user joins, the API waits for
guesses from both users and responds to both users with its response once both guesses come in. The user that guesses the code first wins and the final response shows both users' guessing history.
