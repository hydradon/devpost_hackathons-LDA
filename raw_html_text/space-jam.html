                <p>
                    The graphics and animations. The fact that we all went from knowing nothing about game development to finishing a project.

                    What's next for Space Jam
                </h2>

                    Adding items, fixing UI, and audio. Maybe implementing an opening scene where the player falls asleep and waking up. Also different dreams for different opening scenes.
