                    Last semester during our apartment hunt, we had trouble streamlining the process that would allow us to find a housing location that was tailored to our multiple preferences. Building something that would enable a user simple access filtering for items such as crime, restaurants nearby, available housing, schools, and other items would be a useful tool for anyone at Berkeley looking for a new place to live. Challenges included with this process including working with new technologies in the frontend and easily accessing the backed from the frontend.
