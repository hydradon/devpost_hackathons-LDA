                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wondered how blockchain worked. I was aware of its implementation with currency, but I wanted to explore other applications of this technology. Since it was recently voting season in NJ, I wanted to try to create a secure voting system to prevent fraudulent votes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users register with their licenseID, State, and a valid user ID provided to them by the state as another form of verification. After successfully verifying, they are able to complete their vote and are taken to a confirmation screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created my own version of a blockchain system. Each VoterBlock is encrypted with Secure Hash Algorithms (version 256). This blockchain follows most of the same concepts of common blockchains like Bitcoin and Eutherium. I've implemented Wallets, each Voter Wallet initializes with a value of 1 vote. When placing their vote, a block gets created and verified with a transaction &amp; signiture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was trying to verify the vote chain.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of my better understanding of how Blockchain works. It is really what I wanted to accomplish with this hackathon.
