                        Water is deemed as one of the essentials for every creature in this world to survive.
                    </strong>
                    Living in developed countries, we are not really concerned about the safety of our own drinking water. Sufficient supply made us fall into a delusion that water is no longer a challenge mankind faces. In fact, worldwide, there are approximately 663 million (663,000,000) people without clean, safe water access. That is, 9.47% of the world population do not have clean, safe water access. Among this horrendous numbers, Africa alone has 332 million and Asia has 286 million. [Data Source:

                        Compromised water sources pose significant threats towards human life.
                    </strong>
                    An estimated 801,000 children younger than 5 years of age perish from diarrhea each year, mostly in developing countries. This amounts to 11% of the 7.6 million deaths of children under the age of five and means that about 2,200 children are dying every day as a result of diarrheal diseases. Unsafe drinking water, inadequate availability of water for hygiene, and lack of access to sanitation together contribute to about 88% of deaths from diarrheal diseases. Worldwide, millions of people are infected with neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), many of which are water and/or hygiene-related, such as Guinea Worm Disease, Buruli Ulcer, Trachoma, and Schistosomiasis. These diseases are most often found in places with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and insufficient hygiene practices. [Ref:

                    In the past decade, the international community as well as various NGOs joint effort in providing safe water access to people in Africa and Asia. The overall population in jeopardy has significantly reduced.
                    <strong>
                        While continuing such effort, it is also essential to have 21st century digital systems in place for people to get alarmed of potential risks at real time to prevent further harm.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The importance of having an access to safe drinking water is one of the most urgent problems we are facing as a species, yet it doesn't raise enough awareness as it deserves.
                    </strong>
                    The inspiration for our project was sparkled by one of our teammates' service trip to Africa. The sheer lack of clean drinking water there totally shocked her. What's even more concerning is how under-dressed this issue is, both in Africa and in everywhere else in this world. According to WHO's data, every year around 600,000 people died of diseases caused by contaminated drinking water. The access to safe water resources is crucial to a country's economic development and directly related to the health condition of millions. Acknowledged with these facts, we are trying to build a data-collecting platform that not only alerts people of unsafe drinking water resources but also raises awareness of the "water issue" around the world. Even further than that, other environmental issues like soil or air can and should also be addressed via this platform.
