                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the potential of Machine Learning and the internet of things.
The smart refrigerator was the perfect use case for this. 
It is a challenging task that would provide a significant level of convenience and that greatly inspired us to work on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iFridge is a smartphone application that allows the user to keep track of his/her items in the refrigerator on the go.
It also provides recipe recommendations to the user based on the ingredients in the fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a image recognition model by collecting image data manually and processing them with TensorFlow.
Using a Raspberry Pi connected to a camera module, we were able to set up an image stream that provided us with a constantly updated view of what is in the fridge. 
We then set up a back-end server that processes this image and updates the smartphone application with new data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most significant challenge we had was the difficulty in training the image recognition model such that it could recognize all our objects accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training and developing our own image recognition models without using readily available libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collect and process real world data to recognize image entities in a real world situation. 
Moreover, we learned how to make use of Raspberry pi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 003 - iFridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve our image recognition by training it on a larger data set with a larger variety of items.
We also plan to support multiple object recognition with more advanced machine learning models.
