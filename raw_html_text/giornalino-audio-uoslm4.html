                    The project was born after the birth of
                    <strong>
                        "Foza News"
                    </strong>
                    the journal created by the middle classes of Foza (Vicenza, Italy). It includes several topics that change every month and the articles are created by the pupils.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the skill you can
                    <strong>
                        listen to the articles of the school newspaper.
                    </strong>
                    Once the skill is open, it asks you to
                    <strong>
                        choose which number to read.
                    </strong>
                    Once chosen, just
                    <strong>
                        learn the commands
                    </strong>
                    to navigate through the articles and
                    <strong>
                        you're done!

                <p>
                    I built the skill through the
                    <strong>
                        Voice Flow platform
                    </strong>
                    (just
                    <strong>
                        drag the blocks
                    </strong>
                    , set up what alexa / the user has to say and
                    <strong>
                        join them together
                    </strong>
                    . There are also blocks for playing multimedia files and much more), while the

                        multimodal diplay
                    </strong>

                    <strong>
                        appropriate tool provided by Amazon
                    </strong>
                    . The graphic was created with Canva.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I met
                    <strong>
                        several challenges
                    </strong>
                    , but I managed to overcome! Initially the skill was created with another platform (become paid) and in a short time I had to find a new platform and rebuild the skill; then the skill, during the insertion of the number 2, had some technical problems and I had to modify a whole number to solve everything and also I had to modify everything that Amazon asked for. In addition, I have overcome a great challenge: to show my friends that I am not a person who is incapable and who is worthwhile.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the final result of the skill (which is constantly being updated) and of what I am told by teachers and friends.

                <p>
                    I learned to program with Alexa through Voice Flow and also learned to program on other assistants (on which the magazine is now available)

                    "Giornalino Audio" will continue to be
                    <strong>
                        updated with the numbers of "Foza News" until June 2019
                    </strong>
                    (the month in which school ends in Italy) and will remain
                    <strong>
                        available
                    </strong>
                    for reading / listening.
                    <strong>
                        If approved by teachers, if the journal will be re-proposed in the 2019/2020 school year and if I will always create the "Audio Journal" the skill will begin to be updated again, with the addition of being able to choose the school year before of publication and then the number you want to read.
