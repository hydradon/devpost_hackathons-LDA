                <p>
                    For this hack, we tried to create something that
                    <strong>
                        involved all of the other hackers
                    </strong>
                    and is able to have an actual
                    <strong>
                        impact
                    </strong>
                    on this weekend. We hope to be on main stage and get
                    <strong>
                        a thousand hackers to participate at once
                    </strong>
                    , while we raise awareness about an important global issue.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Conscious Crowd is a web app that enables teachers, HR managers, and speakers to more
                    <strong>
                        effectively raise awareness
                    </strong>
                    of important issues such as sustainability, climate change, gender issues and etc. It allows them to create interactive "swipe quizzes" that
                    <strong>
                        hundreds of people can participate at the same time
                    </strong>
                    . With Conscious Crowd, the results are released after people have submitted their questions. The results help
                    <strong>
                        highlight misconceptions and mistakes
                    </strong>
                    that people have about the selected topic. The user experience is
                    <strong>
                        fluid
                    </strong>
                    , as participants swipe left for "Wrong" and right for "Right".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stating facts is easy, but it doesn't stick. Conscious Crowd help
                    <strong>
                        make ideas stickier
                    </strong>
                    by making them
                    <strong>
                        interactive
                    </strong>
                    while providing a
                    <strong>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create, in 36 hours, a website that can host a large number of people at the same time, some clever engineering was required. We used Flask to create a lightweight, fast backend, and connected to state-of-the-art APIs such as Firebase for quick storage and Azure for reliable hosting. 
Many challenges arose from this hack. Even though are not using "buzzwords" such as AI or Blockchain, making a hack to serve the rest of the event wasn't easy. The APIs required help from mentors to set up properly and the whole process of developing something that can very quickly receive, save and parse data exhausted our brains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having finished a hack that can have immediate impact. We are proud of having in our team first-time hackers as well as veterans. We worked together as a team and learned from each other. We are thankful for the opportunity to do this at Hack the North.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Members learned about Git, new APIs, frontend development, debugging, teamwork, backend development, whiteboarding, data collection.

                <p>
                    We hope to make the process of creating a quiz more accessible to everyone. Also, we want to improve the design when we have time. And expand on the pre-existing quizzes
