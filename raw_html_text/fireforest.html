                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a game player, we found games could do so many powerful and wonderful things, especially knowing Ubisoft made the AC: Unity free for a week after Notre Dame de Paris was on fire. Recently we realized the forest fire in Australia is so serious so we try to make a game to let people understand the importance of the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program/game is being developed using Visual Studio API. The main propose of the program is to allow young children to learn about environmental knowledge while having fun. The lessons being included within the game consist of the molecular structure of carbon dioxide, incorporated into the current disaster of the Australia forest fire. As of today, the Australia fire has killed over 1 billion animals (that's why the koala was being chosen), and over 25 million acres of land have been set ablaze
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three different stages;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Coming up with the idea based on the current global issue of Australian fire
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Building the program using PhotoShop, Visual Studio API, and collaborate with teammates using GitHub
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rethink about what can be improved at the next stage. For example, up-down counter, and camera follow can be incorporated to ensure user experience.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ubisoft: All three team members are at the beginner level of programming. None of us are coming from a computer science background. This is a whole new learning experience. Although difficult, we managed to have built some features, while having fun.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students from different backgrounds, we really started to know how the game works without Unity Engine or Unreal Engine, and start as a real game designer to use the provided engine to design and develop the game. We are so proud that we could use games to express what we want to let others have a better understanding of our ideas or beliefs, we will memorize this valuable experience and keep the gaming spirit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned or had better skills of Github, Photoshop, Visual Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FireForest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we could have more time, smoke will be added on the top of the tree, and have a better color change for the trees as score changes. The complexity would also be increased, as we could make it be a 3D game and have multiple players.
