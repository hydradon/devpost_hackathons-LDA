                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group found each other slowly over a few hours and we worked together to create the basic concept of our game. This game is a auto-side scroller where the character can move back and forth a little as well as jump. We eventually developed the idea into a game where you avoid obstacles and enemies in space.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game moves to the left as obstacles and enemies move onto and off of the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using previous knowledge of  how to code using Processing 3 and also experience with Piskel to create sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many problems while coding and we finished most of the basic game then exited without saving.

                    We did some cool things with code and made some text flash and glow.

                    I personally plan on working on it as a side project.
