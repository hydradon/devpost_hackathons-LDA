                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into Hack Davis looking to find an easy way to inform people of their current health condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website informs users of several of their current health statistics and then prompts the creation of a personalized schedule that incorporates these health statistics to optimize their day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used the platform python everywhere because it allowed us to use our skills in python while also allowing us to create a user interface on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team didn't expect to run into challenges creating a website; it was the team's first time using HTML but luckily through collaboration and research we were able to create our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our group has ever used HTML before. Now that we're done with our project though, each member of the team feels confident in the basics of the essential language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that some of the most valuable knowledge comes when you're truly challenged. There were many moments we were simply stumped but through perseverance, we gained skills that we otherwise wouldn't have developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifestyle+
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hope is to further develop the user interface after Hack Davis is over.
