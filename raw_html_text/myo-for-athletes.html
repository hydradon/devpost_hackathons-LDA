                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really excited for the hardware that the MLH brought to StaCS Hack and we really wanted to get our hands dirty with some of them. 
After a bit of brainstorming, being that most of our teammates are part of some of the sport teams here at St. Andrews, an application for athletes became an obvious. The best piece of hardware to facilitate this was the Myo Armband.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app currently takes a constant stream of data from the Myo's 8 muscle activity sensors and translates it into data about each muscle group that it is connected to. We consider that even though the current prototype shows only real-time data, the access to that data allows us to add a multitude of features in the future.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is built in Android Studio, using Java. We tried to abide to the material design rules as much as we could.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges that we had is the Android SDK for Myo doesn't expose the raw data for the 8 muscle activity sensor. Thankfully the open source community came to our rescue, and we found a project that implemented an API that exposed the data we needed. 
The other challenge was in aggregating the individual sensor data so that we match it to the individual statement.

                    We made a working product that might be commercially viable

                    We'll add more features in the future like:
