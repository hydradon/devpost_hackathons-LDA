                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a domain name that is catchy and memorable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is so far simply a website domain, we weren't able to add anything more to it because of limited time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first time creating a domain, so I was having difficulty finding out how to create a domain in the first place.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to come up with the name and being able to learn how to create the domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
