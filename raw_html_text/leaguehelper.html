                </h2>
                <p>
                    League of Legends, a popular video game with a very large fanbase. While there are plenty of tools to help players take a look at the stats and win rates of certain playable characters, there hasn't been a very popular personal tool to keep track of one's personal stats and win rates. LeagueHelper is here to assist those players!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compares the player's personal statistics with previous match history and attempts to show what has been successful in the past and will show suggestions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Java language and its many libraries, we created a GUI and an algorithm to compare to previous match history as well as store new matches.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had several issues attempting to get  the GUI to work with the rest of the code, and also the algorithm was causing issues with sorting as well.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our first Hackathon, we are proud of the fact that we got something out and had attempting something that we were not very experienced in.
