                    Lots of data exist around us, people and companies want to receive accurate consumer information and make predictive analyses from that information. We decided to curate lists and models for these consumers who are looking for some kind of sentiment regarding a particular product, company, or just about any other topic out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can request models/user lists to be built around positive, negative, or neutral sentiments for just about any topic out there and we can run the model and return results to the user using our deep neural net architecture.
