                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sustainability has gained much attention in recent years, and we wanted to create an application that removed roadblocks preventing students from living more sustainable lives. No one goes out of their way to
                    <strong>
                        not
                    </strong>
                    be environmentally friendly, but it can also be hard to make people go out of their way to be sustainable. Because of this, we wanted to make a product that made it even easier for students to be sustainable in their everyday lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoGreen is a dynamic map that allows users to view the locations of nearby recycling bins across campus. GeoGreen allows users to accurately locate outdoor recycling bins near them as well as view bin locations in building nearby. By showing nearby locations of recycling bins, we make it easier for students to actively participate in sustainable habits in their day-to-day lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoGreen was built using Wolfram|One Technologies paired with CSV location databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technologies we chose to use were very powerful in some ways and very limiting in others. Our biggest challenges were working with and around the technologies to find creative ways to implement the goals we set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create a product that will help promote sustainability across campus. Also, as a group of fairly new hackers, we are proud to be able to demo a product that we grew from the bottom-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Wolfram|One Technologies to build a dynamic map with interactive features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoGreen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to gain access to additional floor plans of buildings across campus so we can provide students with the most accessibility to bins. We also hope to deploy this as a web or mobile application to increase the ease of usability for users. The more information and better user experience we provide to users, the more likely they are to use the application and form sustainable habits.
