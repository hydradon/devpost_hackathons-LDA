                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, 8 in 10 Americans shop online. Not to mention more than 40% of online customers return their products. These activities all result in the damage of our precious environment. Online retailers will not explicitly reveal the carbon footprint of the product, but our chrome extension will. We want to make an extension that is simple and easy to use to analyse the sustainability index of the product people are buying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Chrome extension analyses data given by online retailers and gives the sustainability index of the product out of 5. We want our product should be simple and easy to understand by the majority of the customer. Customers can click on further links to find more details if they wish.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of 24 hours, the 4 of us built the project, with two dedicated to the programming of the front-end and two dedicated to the back-end. 
The front-end team mainly focused on making the chrome extension UI as simple and as easy to understand as possible for the user. Our front-end team also worked on the interface between front-end and back-end (i.e. connecting python to Javascript and html.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our back-end team worked on analysing raw data from the webpages to create the sustainability matrix.
