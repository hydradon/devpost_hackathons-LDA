                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't originally intend to make this but I wanted to do parallaxing and tiling for any future projects so I implemented them, and then ended up building this.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just avoid the placeholders, SPACE to jump, holding it makes you jump higher, tap slowly to do a smaller jump
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have no clue what I'm doing with Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much better with Unity now (although still pretty bad)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Terrible Mistake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably not much, but if I do anything I'll probably add actual art for the obstacles, a menu and actual levels.
