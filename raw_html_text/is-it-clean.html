                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet is a crude place and sometimes you just want to know what you're getting into.  Originally I wanted to censor all the political nonsense that I see on Facebook, but instead I decided to gear it towards the Hack Harassment category and have it warn the user about curse words on a page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chrome extension that looks at the script of a page and produces an alert as a warning if there is any inappropriate language on the page when you click the button under the extension icon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using basic JavaScript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a really hard time figuring out how to actually get the extension to read the contents of the page that is intended to be analyzed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I powered through and came up with ~something~ in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and how it works.  I have never really worked with it in such detail before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Is it Clean?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think I would like to actually get it to censor the inappropriate language opposed to just giving a warning about it.  That would definitely be a fun project to tackle!
