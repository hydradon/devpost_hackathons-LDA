                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to solve small problem in the world with a product or service which involves Artificial Intelligence.
We tried to make people's life easier somehow, and we focused on deaf.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application transcribe the speech to text and vice-versa according to people's need. It also add the emotion to the text so the message is more complete. People does not need any former training to communicate because the application can also translate sign language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Azure Cognitive service and Speech service from Microsoft, which convert text to speech, and speech to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to find an idea that was not implemented by Microsoft yet, and that was feasible.
We struggled to build an application which combine different technologies that work independently.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that technology can solve almost every problem in the world.

                    What's next for Deafone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement the technology to wearable devices which can give real time information.
Make a voice more human (less robotic) to reflect better emotions.
Extend the app to include more disabled people.
