                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had previously worked with web design scripts, and have always wanted to create a mobile app. With Ionic, I'm able to use my existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional mobile application!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each of my four classes I'm taking this semester at UW Madison are in a list on the startup screen. Selecting any of these classes will show each assignment I have weekly for that particular class. These assignments can be selected as checkboxes to mark them being done.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before coming to this hackathon, I had minimal to no knowledge of how angular.js worked. Now, I understand its functionality and have used it to sculpt the backbone of my app. Using my new knowledge of angular and my integrated knowledge of the Ionic Frameworks, I was able to create an app with multiple nested views and selectable items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an app using 2 frameworks I knew little about was difficult. I had to start out learning the basics of angular and what its purpose was. I originally started out making small angular web pages in order to learn angular's functionality instead of going big right away. I made a horoscope app, an app using the Google Maps API, and then finally the To-Do list app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in to this hackathon, my goal was simply to create a mobile app, regardless of functionality. I ended up creating an app that not only looks nice, but has multiple functions and features I had no idea I would be able to implement. I am proud that I was able to come in, learn 2 frameworks in a night, and churn out a functional app that I can use every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned both the angular framework and the Ionic framework. I learned how to combine both to create a mobile application without any native code.
                </p>

                    What's next for MinnehackIonicApp

                <p>
                    When I get back to Madison, I will focus on modifying the storage of the values of each assignment, making my app able to remember which assignments I have completed and which ones I have yet to complete. I can set alerts on the app to remind me if the deadline for a certain assignment I haven't completed is near. This is an app I can use everyday, so using the skills I've learned here I can develop it into something unique.
