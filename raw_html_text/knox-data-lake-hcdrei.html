                    The first problem that we focused on, is one that we didn't hear anyone mention, but will be the single most important contributing factor to the success of the open data initiative, long term.  How will Knoxville handle the ingestion, security, and delivery of source data from 1000's of disparate government organizations?

                    The challenge we focused on was the Facade and Pilot programs and trying to determine their success.  These challenges were especially difficult to tackle, because of the gaps in source data we were provided for the hackathon.
