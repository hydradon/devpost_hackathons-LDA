                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something like Netflix recommendations for research papers... because a nonzero number of us like reading those, and a certain ranty lecture from class stuck with us.

                <p>
                    Presents the user with a paper title, author, conference, abstract, and URL to the paper. The user rates (on a scale of 1-3) how much they'd like to read the paper based on the abstract. A user's highly rated papers are noted and they can reference which papers (and respective URLs) they wanted to see.
