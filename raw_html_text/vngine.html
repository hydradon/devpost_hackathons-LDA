                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a visual novel using an existing engine for the hackathon, however we then wondered if we could create our own engine to make the visual novel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It interprets textfiles containing commands, turning it into a functioning visual novel. It can set backgrounds, sprites to be displayed; it can create dialogue and branching choices for the user. We aimed to make the syntax as simple as possible, with example commands such as follows:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>bg "bg.png"
sprite "characterID" "sprite.gif"
dia "characterID" "character dialogue"
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, mainly utilising Regex to create our own syntax to be interpreted.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to implement branches were a challenge.

                <p>
                    Learning how to output text from a text file into the GUI and have it update after button presses.
