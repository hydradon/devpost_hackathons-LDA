                    is a revolutionary food app that uses a ground-breaking visual recognition API from Clarifai and combines it with the Google Places API to bring you to all those delicious-looking foods.

                    is easy. All you have to do is input the URL of a picture of your choice. Click "Go!" and in a few seconds, your mysterious (but delicious-looking) food item will be identified and you'll have a list of nearby restaurants where you can go get your food.

                <p>
                    Our next steps are to allow image uploads, map restaurants out for users, and incorporate user feedback on the accuracy of our identifications in order to provide better results in the future. We also plan to expand to a mobile app, which will allow users to use their camera, take a picture, and get instant feedback.
