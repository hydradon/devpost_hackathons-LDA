                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Resident Roommate is having trouble waking up early in the morning. He usually oversleeps and has trouble waking up in time. It is known that oversleeping can cause many medical problems like diabetes, heart disease, and increased risk of death. In order to prevent this, we made the Adaptive Interactive Deep Sleep Program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to input in how many hours they wake want to wake up and our program determines the person's sleep stage that the user will be going to wake up and plays the appropriate music based on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using Python
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compatibility issues, Program Syntax incorrectly working
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What did we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How sleep cycles work and Python can predict and act appropriately based on this data.
