                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The healthcare industry is overrun with an overloaded work force and heavily regulated health system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homeward Healthcare automates patient discharge and analyzes a patient's readmission risk with social health determinants to prepare for the most effective recovery plan post-discharge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homeward Healthcare is built as an Android application and web browser experience. The Android application is patient facing for a multimedia discharge experience in a survey format. The web browser is the dashboard that feed the results and care suggestions back to the healthcare professionals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, all of the software was run via a web browser but spotty hospital internet connections forced the creation of a natively run application to cache the patient results until a connection can be made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first pilot project run in Hurley Medical Center reduced all cause readmissions by 33.4% with a 47% reduction in CHF. A white paper study was published by Kettering University.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients are much more comfortable and honest with a tablet in the privacy of their hospital bed than during a nurse led discharge instruction session. Nurse's then can come to the discharge episode for shorter periods of time with more informed discussions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Homeward Healthcare MDP Innovation Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expansion into the current clients that we have with more engaging and specific patient centered products.
