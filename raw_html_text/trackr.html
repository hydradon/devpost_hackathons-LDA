                    This app sets out to create a unique way of tracking and visualizing a person's week based on the amount of time they spend in certain locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is still work being done to extend this application to mobile devices, eliminate redundant code, and create even more insights and visualizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users save specific locations like "home" and "work" and the app takes care of the rest to see how long they are in each location throughout the week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coolest part of this project is the opportunity to visualize the data people create through the service to show them their week in new and exciting ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to extend this service very soon to mobile apps across platforms to easily track people's locations and gather real-time data.
