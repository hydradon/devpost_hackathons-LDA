                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Meteor, React, MongoDB, and Semantic UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were still learning the basics of managing databases, so it was a little difficult to set up the databases for storing events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the baseline web app we have created, with the ability to add and create events in the app itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot in terms of teamwork and project management. In terms of technical work, we have learned how to better develop user interfaces and databases.
