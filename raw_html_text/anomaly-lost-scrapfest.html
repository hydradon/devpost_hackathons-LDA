                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something unique and not cliche. We settled upon a futuristic adventure where you explore desolate planets and destroyed ships in search of the answer to a great mystery: the fate of the colony ship Anomaly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pilot your drone scrapper around wastes and asteroids and mine precious resources to help you survive as you quest to find the fate of the Anomaly in this procedurally-generated Scrapfest! (WIP)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it from the ground up using Python and the Pygame module. Two of the team members worked on programming and two worked on art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made everything so far in about 5 hours, as the brainstorming process took quite some time. In addition, Pygame has many odd bugs that complicated the process for us, including graphics not rendering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually completed enough of a game to call it that. We also thought up a unique, original idea that has not been done much before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is not the best game engine, especially in a limited time frame. If you have hours on end to fix bugs, go right ahead, but it's not for people who only have 5 hours to make a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anomaly Lost (Scrapfest)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue the development on this incomplete game to make it into the great adventure we thought up.
                </p>
