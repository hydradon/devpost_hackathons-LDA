                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my internship at Sweetwater, I found a love for hearing nature in a better experience than what other skills have offered. A colleague of mine records all of the audio. While very limited to 4 sounds right now we wanted to capture the pristine audio of the Midwest United States.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural Nature is a very simple skill that allows users to experience audio from nature. It has 4 tracks that have minimal editing (just compression and minor EQ) to really showcase nature as we hear it as humans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a combination of Voiceflow, shoutout to them, S3, CloudFront and Lambda to build the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customer experience is really important and in some audio skills I noticed they would ask "Are you still listening?". I really didn't like this but I know that it is important to help data transfer costs. My solution was to use a CDN so that it can still run but not accure so many transfer charges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first skill I have built, although not a new idea or a big project I enjoyed learning about AWS and really taking a dive into the ecosystem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned all about AWS environments and how IDEs interact between the two. The whole publishing and updating the skill is something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Natural Nature Alexa Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more audio, my colleague and I are in that process right now actually. If you have read this far then consider going to cesaonic.com and reading blogs about how we capture it.
