                    Inspiration'
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the rise of IoT devices and the backbone support of the emerging 5G technology, BVLOS drone flights are becoming more readily available. According to CBInsights, Gartner, IBISworld, this US$3.34B market has the potential for growth and innovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Reconnaissance drone software that utilizes custom object recognition and machine learning to track wanted targets.
                    </strong>
                    It performs close to real-time speed with nearly 100% accuracy and allows a single operator to operate many drones at once. Bundled with a light sleek-designed web interface, it is highly inexpensive to maintain and easy to operate.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        There is a Snapdragon Dragonboard that runs physically on the drones capturing real-time data and processing the video feed to identify targets. Identified targets are tagged and sent to an operator that is operating several drones at a time. This information can then be relayed to the appropriate parties.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a Snapdragon Dragonboard that runs physically on the drones capturing real-time data and processing the video feed to identify targets. This runs on a Python script that then sends the information to a backend server built using NodeJS (coincidentally also running on the Dragonboard for the demo) to do processing and to use Microsoft Azure to identify the potential targets. Operators use a frontend to access this information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining a way to reliably demonstrate this project became a challenge considering the drone is not moving and the GPS is not moving as well during the demonstration. The solution was to feed the program a video feed with simulated moving GPS coordinates so that the system believes it is moving in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The training model also required us to devote multiple engineers to spending most of their time training the model over the hackathon.

                <p>
                    The code flow is adaptable to virtually an infinite number of scenarios with virtually

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great amount on computer vision and building/training custom classification models. We used Node.js which is a highly versatile environment and can be configured to relay information very efficiently. Also, we learned a few javascript tricks and some pitfalls to avoid.

                    What's next for Recognaissance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the classification model using more expansive datasets. Enhancing the software to be able to distinguish several objects at once allowing for more versatility.
