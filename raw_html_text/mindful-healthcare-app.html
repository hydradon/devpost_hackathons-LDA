                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the rising concerns of mental health issues and illnesses. We wanted to provide a user friendly platform that raises awareness of mental health care and guides users to seek the help they need. This app emphasizes accessible, effective and professional help, reducing the need for more traditional and costly services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app provides users a user friendly diagnosis quiz for their mental health illnesses. This app is able to determine whether the user suffers from depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating and/or domestic abuse. Utilizing the diagnosis quiz and results, the user is then able to contact a professional to seek help and guidance, through our in-app messaging service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app on Android Studio using Java programming. Using a combination of techniques and objects, we were able to create an intuitive interface and user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as creating a smooth interface. We also ran into technical challenges where our code did not work as planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a very stunning app that was able to do exactly what we wanted. On top of that, we were able to create a messaging function on the app itself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to grow as designers and developers. Working as a team, we developed communication and collaboration skills, as well as becoming more equipped in Java and Android Studio. We also learned how to face adversities very well, as we were able to go through all the challenges along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MiNDFUL Healthcare App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of industry professionals, we want to improve our diagnostic quiz to give more accurate and specific results. With more connections, we would like to expand our network of professional dietitians, psychiatrists and resources for users. Lastly we would like to add even more features, such as progress tracking and a feature to help users support loved ones with mental health issues.
