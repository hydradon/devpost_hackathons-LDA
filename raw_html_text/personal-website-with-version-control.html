                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having just a linkedin profile or a static resume wasn't satisfying enough, I wanted to create something more custom and use it as an opportunity to learn the essentials of using git, html5, CSS, Bootstrap, and GCP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosts my personal website on my domain using the GCP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with lots of note taking on HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, as well as basic terminal commands for git. After I got my domain set up and open to the internet, I started on the site design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ran into lots of challenges as this was my first exposure to all of this information. One major issue I had was getting permissions to work in GCP and on domain.com where I was getting a "403 forbidden result".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm glad that I finally understand the fundamentals of front end design, and more importantly how to keep track of my versions. I also have a domain with my name on it open to the www now!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, git, github, GCP (using buckets for a website)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Personal Website with Version Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My next step would be using more of the GCP to create an engine that would sync my github repository with the bucket from which the website is running. This was I can push updates in a much faster timeframe.
