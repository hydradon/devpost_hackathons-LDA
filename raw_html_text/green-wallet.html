                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to return the power of sustainable living to the hands of the consumers, beginning with helping clients be well-informed about the sustainability of their spending habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Green Wallet uses transaction data from the Capital One API to generate a Spending Sustainability Report, similar to a credit score. The Report ranges from 0 to 1000, with 0 being the most sustainable and 1000 being the least sustainable. The score on your Report is calculated by pulling data about the transaction (price, merchant, purchase category and description) and the corresponding data about the merchant (sustainability rating), sending the data to the python script, and returning the Report score to be sent to the website.
                </p>
