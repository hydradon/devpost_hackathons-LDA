                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team realised it's hard to plan a holiday abroad, especially when there's so many destinations to pick from. We realised we could build a service that can schedule you trips across multiple cities and give you the best possible price.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our service picks a series of cities from different parts of the world and plans a trip across all of them, picking the cheapest flights and hotel prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the team into frontend and backend. In the backend team, we utilized the go programming language to give our application a basic structure. In addition, we employed JavaScript to update our pages dynamically without the need to refresh. We also used the Skyscanner API throughout in order to give our application a good structure that would make it usable.
In terms of front-end, we used Bootstrap (as a CSS framework) and HTML to give our page readability and to make it appealing to the customers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it challenging to understand a lot of the concepts the Skyscanner API used, but after some research around some of the tools it used, we managed to understand how they were used and we were consequently able to utilize them in our own application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having integrated both the backend and frontend together to have produced a web application that essentially works as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the Skyscanner API and how we could use some of its open source code in our own application such as the destination search tool. In addition, I also learned how to use other API source code such as that from Google. We used the map from its API to help users select destinations in our own application.

                    What's next for TravelPlanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had had more time, we would have liked to add the option for the user to add more cities to his trip. He could have personalized recommendations for all the cities he would like to visit.
