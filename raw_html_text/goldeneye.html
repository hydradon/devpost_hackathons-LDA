                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of scrapping the data of the statutes. We decided to look at the heart of the problem. The way is it is stored and updated makes it very tedious for anyone to access them or even find consistency in the structure of the statutes. Our app strives to make the statutes easily accessible for the people as well as easily maintainable for the state.
