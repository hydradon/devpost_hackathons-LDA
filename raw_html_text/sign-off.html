                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a world where people often skim and hate reading long documents. We wanted to solve the problem of people signing the documents, business contracts, etc in a hurry. We want to create an error proof and efficient process of contract signing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product summarizes the content of documents into a few key lines which will give an overview to the user about the contract. This allows the reader to understand the summary and main points behind the text. Then using DocuSign's API, the user can share the contract to be signed by the recipient. The recipient of contract will also get the summarized text through the API of DocuSign through his email. After that the recipient will sign the contract and the sender will receive notifications on when this is done. DocuSign's main purpose is signing, but our team was able to utilize it's other features such as end to end notification on where the document is on this signing process.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend - Django Web Development Framework, DocuSign API, Python. Our highly efficient backend was written in Python with 90%+ accuracy in summarizing the main points of a document. We used machine learning and a ranking scheme to create this.
