                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That inspiration that started this project was to enhance the current conservation process by using technology to educate, people of all ages, about species categorized outside and within the endangered group. This would introduce next generation data collection by letting the general public to contribute and help lessen the severity of the wildlife conservation issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has a game system which serves as a database to allow people to learn about various species of animals and plants. To aid in database search, the app consists of reverse photo search paired with geographical locating feature to improve data collection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the Proto.io platform and integrated many of the features listed above into the app. For instance, we included various pages such as a profile page, an explorer page, a photo page, a resources page with links to other conservation efforts and organizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we went into is making this idea more interactive, so that people of all ages could use this and learn from it. We also wanted this app to encourage more people to go outside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we came up with was designing an app using a prototyping platform to illustrate our concept of conservation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about teamwork, communication, improving our skills using Proto.io, and learned more about the design process through this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Name that Thing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating code into the program to allow for picture recognition of different animals and plants would be the next step for this project.
