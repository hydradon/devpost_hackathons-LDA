                    Seeing alot of technology is developing in a month,year i have great think in my mind to build a new tools in which people can see their products, know about their products,buy their products,and compare price of that product from different websites all they can do at one click...

                    If you try to build different things people will against you but if you passionate,focus and dedication to your work is fixed then no one can stop you from doing this to do the innovation and change the world.
