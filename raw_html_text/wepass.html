                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by our thirst for knowledge, we created a simple-to-use app that will break all barriers between teacher and student interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WePass is an educational platform that connects teaching staff and students, allowing greater opportunity for open-ended learning and a convenient medium for everyone to share their own inquisitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged the advantages of Ruby on Rails to coordinate with databases, while using HTML and CSS to provide an appealing user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our members is proficient in Ruby on Rails, so productivity was slow during the beginning of the creation process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we've created a functional website despite our deficits in programming skill and time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should be more proactive in the future by downloading all the necessary tools needed to code certain languages, as well as taking the initiative to become more familiar with the languages we plan to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WePass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better UI, improved functionality and additional features.
