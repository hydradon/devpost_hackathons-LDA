                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members got sick of keeping track of their musical progress via notebooks. They both play guitar and had interest in similar platforms so they decided to work together on this.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters what are called subskills into the app. A subskill can be something as simple learning a particular song or practicing a particular scale. When they enter the subskill, they also have to enter the name of some sort of metric to track progress for that subskill. For example, if the user entered "Practicing F/Am Change" as a subskill, then they might put "CPM", the number of changes between the chords they can do per minutes, as the name of the metric to track that subskill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the user can also track the progress of their subskills over a long period of time by entering their progress on whatever subskill they want to work on into a daily log. They can also analyze their progress for an individual subskill over time using graphs. They can also graph how much they've practiced day to day.

                    It can probably be polished up alot and some the originally intended functionality could be brought in
