                    Automation is becoming a bigger part of our life. Why do boring things like manually signing in when you can use technology to your advantage?

                <h2>
                    Raspberry PI captures a picture of you using the camera connected to it. Then it uses C++ openCV library for face recognising software, which then compares the picture to the list of images given in the database. Then it chooses the one that is the most accurate and recognises the person.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The biggest challenge that we faced were that faces were not recognised accurately enough, but we updated the software to fix that.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishment that I'm proud of is that it works with a good accuracy given that the people have their images in the library.

                    What I learned was to use QT for interface and openCV.
