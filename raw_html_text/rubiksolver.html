                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from trying to make something useful and fun for augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps others to solve rubik's cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simply developed our own image recognition codes and run against our logic structure to solve the rubik's cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to find AR resources/SDK/API but we could not find any.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually managed to do image recognition in a live video thread, which we are proud of.  We also managed to render 3d object (rubik's cube) in object oriented programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about the handling of Augmented Reality, and more about Android's structure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rubiksolver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the image recognition so that wherever the cube is we can recognize it.
