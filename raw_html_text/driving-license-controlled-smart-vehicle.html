                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; So, we went through an incident a few days back where one of our close friend went through a car crash accident in Ohio, where a juvenile unregistered driver hit her while she was crossing the road.
&bull; Now, going through this we knew we had to do something about it and so we decided to come up with a project that is named Driving License Controlled Smart Vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; Any vehicle that we own or buy has to be in registered with the DMV office where we are given a Plate Number that us unique to the owner and is linked to the owners license. So using this correlation we thought of a way that if we can save a unique biometric credential and link it to the car as well as the license. 
&bull; The unique biometric credential can be used as a virtual key for the car i.e when a drive puts the key in the key hole they also need to verify using a biometric kit in the car and verify themselves.
&bull; If the verification goes accurately then and then only will the car start or else it won&rsquo;t start.
&bull; Now, the main car owner can also add family members to the car so that they can also be authorized to drive the car and that can be just don&rsquo;t by the website that we created where we can just add family members to the car.
&bull; For that the owner has to verify their credentials with the website where a one time password will be sent to them after verification they can add new family members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    can we achieve this?
&bull; This can simply be achieved by a simple Raspberry pi operation and a simple code snippet that checks the database for an accurate biometric fingerprint.
&bull; The device might need internet connection initially to initialize or to update any changes made to the system.
&bull; The website is a simple website where the user has to verify themselves in order to add family members to the car.
&bull; The website is made using a simple HTML, CSS ad Bootstrap combination.
&bull; All the data at the DMV office is in sync with Google cloud Services .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; Being here I felt the pressure and the anxiety seeing all these talented hackers around so that initially made me nervous.
&bull; We couldn&rsquo;t acquire a Biometric Fingerprint sensor anywhere so the hardware we where trying to formulate could not be made.
&bull; There is the time constraint of coming up with an implementation for your idea in a rigorous environment is certainly challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel accomplished to have come up with an idea that makes lives easier for everyone and to actually be able to implement it was something that made us fell good about ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; To be honest I felt so good being around so many people and how different team function and how every team has a different approach of working on an idea.
&bull; We  had three members on a team that are all software engineers while one us is a pharmacy student who just came here just out of curiosity to see on how hackathons function and to keep her in the loop and making sure that she is keeping up with the pace and methodologies was a challenge as well as a learning curve for the team. I would say she did extremely well under pressure and it felt good to help a fellow innovator through the challenge.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Driving License Controlled Smart Vehicle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next concept that we will want to work on is Fog Elimination using head up cameras. That we use two cameras that give us live feed of the front road as well as the back road. Then we take this feed and run it through an image processing software that eliminates fog and gives a clear picture of the road ad thus avoiding accidents in hazy and foggy weather.
