                    Inspiration- Helping consumers FIND and EAT sustainable seafood.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works- FishBowl approved restaurants, grocers, chefs, and retailers are listed on the FishBowl app with sustainability ratings based on the percent of seafood offered which is sustainably sourced as verified by our partner FishChoice.com.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- Our biggest challenges were time constraint, lack of knowledge about the seafood supply chain,
                </h2>
                <p>
                    and lack of experienced app developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- Securing partnership with FishChoice.com, verifying the concept with the National Aquarium, and acquiring knowledge about sustainable seafood certification and the total supply chain challenges in such a short period of time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- How complicated and challenging providing transparency to a seafood supply chain is as well as how eager stakeholders are to contribute to innovative solutions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FishBowl- Validation with the end users, continued clarification and refinement of the relationship and exclusive agreement with FishChoice.com, and continued development of the android and ios apps.
