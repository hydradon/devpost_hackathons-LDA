                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that 3D viewing and manipulation software had been giving us quite the headache. It all came down to how un-intuitive the navigation was. As such, we built Myosis, an for an unconventional way to view 3D objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses arm gesture recognition technology, gyroscopic motion, acceleration and orientation to view and navigate STL files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and tears... Lots and lots of tears (and Soylent

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had quite a big problem setting up the Myo armband, especially when it had difficulties in gyroscopic readings. Learning 3D rendering techniques from scratch was also quite challenge. Creating a smooth and simple UI from processed values was difficult as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we've built such a responsive web app, despite communication difficulties we faced between the Myo and browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were all pretty well versed in hardware, we faced quite a big learning curve, given all the new modules we had to implement. It was tough but worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Myosis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better zoom, pan, and gesture based controls. We also hope to implement 3d notes/drawing tools, as well as the ability to mold/edit a 3d file with two armbands. If given more time, we would definitely peruse implementation with AR controls with the hand.
