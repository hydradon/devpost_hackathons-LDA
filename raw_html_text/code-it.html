                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I was sitting at work one day and following the various git commands, like push it, pull it, merge it etc. and felt like I was doing a grown up version of bop it. So then I thought, why not actually make one, because that sounds like way more fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is currently working code for each of these components separately and now all that's left if finishing the code integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One LCD display shows the command (this is until we figure out how to add in voice commands).
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Commit it (left) - Twist the middle ring attached to a potentiometer to the left.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Commit it (right) - Twist the middle ring attached to a potentiometer to the right.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branch it (left) - Pull left analog stick to the left.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branch it (right) - Pull right analog stick to the right.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merge it - Push center two analog sticks towards each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fork it - Pull center two analog sticks away from each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Approve it - Move the controller up / down to simulate nodding in approval (this is utilizing the Teensy's accelerometer)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shake it - Move the controller left / right  (this is to add on syntactic sugar)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pull it - There is a 3D printed throttle piece that attaches to the 3rd analog stick, with it's sides super glued so you can only move it forward or pull it back (like a mini throttle). Here you pull the throttle towards you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Push it - Here you push the throttle away from you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code it - The top yellow button is for code it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debug it - The middle yellow button is for debug it, will be denoted with a bug symbol.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clone it - The bottom yellow button is for cloning it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pass it - Here you pass the controller to the next person for multiplayer use.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The idea is for there to be a time component to speed up the command execution over time. So if they perform the wrong command or the game times out, they are greeted with a friendly Windows blue screen of death error, but until then we will use a simple piezo button tone for now. Regular bop it only has 3 commands - bop it, twist it, pull it...while this has 13 commands. So this is like a souped up bop it or simon says for adults who code.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Components include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        3 analog sticks (one with the top pulled off and the sides superglued together to limit it's range of motion to only up / down)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 3D printed throttle piece (not pictured, but it is printed out and ready to use)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 LCD display screens (one to show a command and the other to show health or how many lives you have left).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 seven-segment display for showing the numerical score of how many points you've earned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 potentiometer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 buttons
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4 LEDs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 lid from a cigar box, used for mounting the electronic pieces onto a hard surface.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to think of how the game would make so many comparisons to determine whether the player executed the correct command. Though luckily with some brainstorming with a friend, we came up with an interesting solution to keep the code for this minimal and clean.

                <p>
                    Writing my first C library and custom object oriented code. Challenging myself to write cleaner code.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To not underestimate the logic that went into making what looks to be a simple game like bop it. That the background beat and voice commands seem to be the most challenging part to figure out how to implement.
