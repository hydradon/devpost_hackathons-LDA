                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humans at the mere sight of an image are capable of identifying what objects are there in an image and develop all possible relations between objects in that image. The human detection system when mimicked is capable of generating new solutions in different domains. The current image recognition softwares use classifiers and run feature sets across the image to detect objects in the image, this does lead to a great deal of accuracy. Some of the best ways to get involved with object detection is using cognitive services from Microsoft Vision, TensorFlow [1] and Yolo [2]. The proposed working solution uses a python based wrapper and openCV [3] to feed real time data into the neural network and take intelligent actions from there on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By running a set of same images on cognitive systems Microsoft Vision, TensorFlow and Yolo, a comparative analysis is discussed and based on which certain conclusions are drawn. Factors contributing to selection primarily include speed and accuracy under various stress factors which include distance, light, network connectivity and cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the solution aimed to serve vehicles belonging to citizens of different income groups, it is important to keep the solution cost effective. Cognitive support is the backbone of this system. It is a must to choose cognitive support which comes at minimal cost and satisfies the trade off between cost and accuracy. Despite the fact, providing extremely high accuracies consistently, cognitive support offered by Microsoft comes at a price which makes it not suitable to use in the module, while TensorFlow and Yolo are free to use. Apart from that, we find Microsoft cognitive support requires the continuous presence of an active internet connection which again comes at a cost and thus, further adding to t he amount required for buying and maintaining the product. With this, the module let go of Microsoft Cognitive support despite of its amazing accuracy and consistent predictions. To perform comparative analysis between TensorFlow and Yolo, we run these free cognitive services on a same video[4].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using cognitive service of Yolo, which plots the prediction number vs accuracy for the first 100 predictions, we see that the number of sharp drops are less as compared to TensorFlow and the detection is consistent over a long period of time despite consistency slightly being on the lower side. It is also evident that in the trade off between consistency and accuracy Yolo performs better by providing the required consistency over a longer duration. The application of a Convolutional Neural Network over a predicted set of boxes instead of the whole image where the confidence of finding an object in the image is greater than a set threshold makes Yolo superior and the system believes it would be the most apt cognitive service to fit in the module.

                    We experimented on utilizing OCR feature in UIPath Automation Suite and found that it could be utilized in sharing and extracting text from image data. We use SocialCalc engine (Ethercalc) for data analysis, tabulation, computation and organization of data. Repository of EtherCalc can be found at

                    Our solution supports the notions that users should &ldquo;share by default&rdquo; and be able to &ldquo;explore, express, debug, and critique.&rdquo; Thus our solution puts an emphasis on &ldquo;activities&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;applications.&rdquo; The foundation will focus on solving the challenges that are relevant to these aspects of the interface, namely:
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make it &ldquo;simple&rdquo; to share user activities. This will require an architecture that allows discovery of activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create versions of software that run on multiple operating systems and on multiple hardware platforms. It should be &ldquo;simple&rdquo; to install application everywhere. Specifically, it means packaging for every distribution and every virtual machine&mdash;removing hardware-related dependencies wherever possible.

                    We extended and adapted the learning learned from a use-case such that it could used for not only incident management response system at the roads but also local air traffic control for drones and UAVs. We further explored its implication on developing an air traffic network for air taxis in Special Economic Zones under Smart Cities program. We did this exercise during the hackathon as the ability to extend and adapt towards reusable computing is the need of the hour. This would prevent orphaning of existing neat efforts in computer engineering, sciences and machine learning.
