                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    San Jose - where we're from - has a huge graffiti problem. We thought that having a main portal in which the city (and other users) could track and contribute to reducing this problem would help immensely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GraffitiGram allows users to take pictures of graffiti in their city, giving them variable amounts of points and adding their submission to a city-wide map of graffiti, making it easier for officials to target areas that are particularly paint-covered. In addition, features within the app allow one to map the graffiti incidence with factors such as demographics, median income for a location, or crime rates for better visualization.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built GraffitiGram with Android.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We're very proud of learning Android and about the mobile app ecosystem as well. The workshops help really helped us.

                    What's next for Graffiti Police
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to polish up the app and release it, hopefully with the help of the City of San Jose when we get back.
