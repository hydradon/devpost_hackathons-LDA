                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Girls++ is an organization that builds a strong network of women in Computer Science. We believed in their message of empowering women to take a lead in the tech industry, an industry that is primarily male dominated. After seeing their challenge, we believed that we could help them by building a website that could broaden their reach for new members.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Girls++ website allows prospective members to register, generating a profile on PowerApps. It also allows officers to take attendance at meetings and gather feedback. Members can also apply to be officers through the website.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used glitch as a platform to collaborate and edit the source code for the website. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend development and design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble trying to create and store information on a database. We tried MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB, but we could not get it to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a streamlined and user friendly web application that is aesthetically pleasing.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about front end web development, and the basics of backend web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Girls++ Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to add the ability for each member to upload their schedule onto the website, which Girls++ can use to determine the best time to hold meetings. We are also want to add a study buddy matcher tool, which will help members find other members to study with.
