                <p>
                    Streetfix connects the community to local government to maintain a high quality urban environment. By providing a collaborative platform to local infrastructure inventory and management through crowdsourcing data, community members are able to report poor conditions in vehicular and pedestrian. Through the use of  geotaging, users are able to report poor conditions to maintain safe conditions within the community.

                    Nailing down a concept that was specific in purpose without being too niche took some time. Codewise, implementing Google Maps functionality was a struggle, and there were some difficulties combining templates and work between team members.
