                    Student and freelancers may have created incredible projects that don't stand out on paper as much as seeing the input and output of these programs in action. In addition, a private portfolio page @their_name.com does not get much exposure until the student has already applied to a position independently.

                    ChckMeOut gives people the opportunity to showcase their entire portfolio on a website where they do not know how to do any Web Development, and have an elegant portfolio showcasing their abilities. The exposure comes from recruiters creating accounts and being able to search by tags to relative projects or topics. In addition, they may be able to search by Education or Location in later versions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only does ChckMeOut provide that link between recruiter and students or freelancers but it can be used by younger generations in high school trying to get a taste on what they may be doing as an 'Electrical Engineer' or 'Computer Scientist'.
