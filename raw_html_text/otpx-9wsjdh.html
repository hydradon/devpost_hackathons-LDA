                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As baseball fans, we know that baseball has been losing interest and has become less popular than other sports such as basketball and football. We want people to enjoy baseball and stay attached to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OTPX consists of two main features. The first feature is a trivia questionnaire related to baseball that will keep the user intrigued in between innings or before/after games. It's a good way to stay connected with baseball. The second feature combines Reddit and ESPN's Sportscenter into one highlight central. Users of the app can upload videos/photos of baseball plays(such as home runs or sweet curveball strikeouts), and other users can vote on which play was the best. By the end of each month, whoever has the most "likes" gets a free ticket to a baseball game of their choice. Likewise, for the first feature, whoever answers the most questions correctly in the questionnaire gets a free ticket to a game of their choice. This app not only engages baseball fans but also gives them an incentive to be attached to the game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built OTPX using Java. It is a mobile app, which means that it could be built using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of errors in our programming, and since we were in such a time crunch, we rushed a lot of tasks, but we got them done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely proud of the effort we put in for 6 hours and the fact that, for some of us, we made it through our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this hackathon, our team learned a lot more about the game of baseball and what needs to be improved in the sport itself. For many of us, this was our first hackathon ever, so this was also a very valuable experience for us in that we now know how these things work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OTPX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on using OTPX to increase fan engagement in professional and non-professional baseball games. We want to link with Instagram, another video medium, and TV Networks for the schedule of baseball games. OTPX will be popularized through these partnerships while still allowing users to enjoy baseball.
