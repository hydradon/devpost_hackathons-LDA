                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are over 4 million people who cannot read and write properly, only in Germany.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We detect the problems why people have problems reading and support them accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to track eye movement and emotion scanning to point out the specific problems people have with reading.
We implement it with C# and a library called Glace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had only limited time to learn about our eye tracking sensor since there were only two of them.
The analyzing tool the sensor company "tobi provides is not open for pubic.
We only had very limited time since we also wanted to join the lectures.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are still a group of 4.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about C#, eyetracking devices and APIs
