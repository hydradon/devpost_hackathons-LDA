                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of wastage and hazards occur when devices like stovetops are accidentally left switched on by people when they leave home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By leveraging IoT, JuniorJarvis alerts owners by sending text messages to them if they leave their stove on when they leave for work. It further allows them to turn off their stoves remotely through their smartphones.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Telus IoT Starter kit and used the PIR motion detecting sensor and a thermocouple
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning IoT is easy but working with the various interfaces and getting it to work is a chaalenge
