                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the soylent in the room

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carry two bottles of soylent from the loading station to the aruco marker at the dropoff point.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laser cut acrylic chassis, wheels with DC motors and speed controllers for the hardware. Camera using ROS and aruco detection package on the Raspberry Pi doing the navigation and sending commands to the Arduino motor controller.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing ROS on a Raspberry Pi, getting the aruco markers up and running, controlling the DC motor speed, getting everything built and integrated in time, vehicle navigation, Raspberry Pi-Arduino communication, power supply design.
