                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoCrypt will securely store your passwords and usernames so you don't have to remember them! Interact with your local password storage through a (relatively) friendly command line interface.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoCrypt was written in Go and takes advantage of the built in cryptography library that Go provides. It utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm (with salts) and AES-256 encryption algorithm.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never touched Go before, I had to spend a chunk of time at the beginning of the hackathon learning how to properly utilize the features that Go provides
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy with how effectively I was able to pick up a new language and apply it to build a working application.
To be more specific, I am very happy with how extensible the application is. It is very simple and straightforward to add more functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Go and statically typed programming languages in general. I also gained invaluable experience with respect to standard cryptography libraries and how they are structured.
