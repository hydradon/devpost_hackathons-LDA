                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop a smart alarm that could adjust when it rang based on real-time, real-world data, to make sure that we woke up with enough time to get where we needed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartAlarm takes in multiple real world data points, such as weather, traffic, user sleep cycles, and user travel history, to determine an optimal time to set an alarm. The user simply enters a destination and a time they'd like to arrive, and our app takes care of the rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is a native Android application. We use several Google Play services such as Google-Places and the Google-Distance-Matrix, we also use forecast.io for real time weather data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our members had never done an Android app before. Our group wanted a fun new challenge in unfamiliar territory. As a result of some inexperience, we had many challenges when developing the application. Also, all of the services and external API's we used for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we got a functioning Android application up and running in under 24 hours ( more like 20 if you count the time it took to come up with the idea). We're also very proud of the fact that we got the different API's and services to work in such a short time, despite our lack of experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure to sleep before a hackathon! Also that it's very important to have a solid structure and even distribution of responsibilities in order to make sure that everyone's on the same page. Don't forget to commit either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NeverLate SmartAlarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We truly believe that SmartAlarm has a large potential for use in the market. Everyone from children, students, young professionals, to senior citizens could do with a little more punctuality.
