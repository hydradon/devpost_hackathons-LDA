                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tax Simulator 2019 takes inspiration from a variety of different games, such as the multitude of simulator games that have gained popularity in recent years, the board game Life, and the video game Pokemon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tax Simulator is a video game designed to introduce students to taxes and benefits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tax Simulator was built in Unity using C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we had to overcome was time. Creating the tax calculation system, designing and building the game's levels, implementing the narrative text elements, and debugging every single area of the program were all tedious and demanding tasks, and as a result, there are several features of the game that have not yet been fully implemented, such as the home-purchasing system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use the Unity game engine also proved to be a challenge as not all of us had past experience with the software, so picking up the skills to implement our ideas into our creation and develop a fleshed-out product was an essential yet difficult task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although simple, Tax Simulator incorporates concepts such as common tax deductions and two savings vehicles in a fun and interactive game. The game makes use of a charming visual aesthetic, simple mechanics, and an engaging narrative that makes it fun to play through, and we're very proud of our ability to portray learning and education in an appealing way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that although it is tempting to try and incorporate as many features as possible in our project, a simple game that is easy to understand and fun to play will keep players engaged better than a game with many complex features and options that ultimately contribute to confusion and clutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tax Simulator 2019
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it is a great start for learning about taxes, Tax Simulator could benefit from incorporating more life events such, purchasing a house with the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive or having kids, and saving for college with RESPs. The game could also suggest ways for players to improve their gameplay based on how the decisions they made regarding their taxes.
