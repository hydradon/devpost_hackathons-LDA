                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and our first semester in computer science, so we decided to make something reasonable but still personally challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game of connect four to be played with two people using the number keys on the keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a computer. Specifically, one running java with the swing packages in eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were simply mechanics, in particular the mechanic that allowed the game to tell when a player has won.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much all of this. Like I said, we're relatively new to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use javax.swing, as well as how to implement keyboard input and an updating GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect Four
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for this will likely be an ai opponent. (Maybe one that always wins, since the game is solved. That'd be funny to show people).
