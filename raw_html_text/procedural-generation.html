                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to bridge the gap between technology and creativity and enable users to interact with what they make.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes in hand gesture infrared sensor inputs from a LeapMotion sensor and translates them into creation and manipulation of procedurally generated geometric objects on the computer screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally started the project by trying to generate shapes for jewelry design. As we programmed, we saw the potential of the LeapMotion sensor to link the digital and physical worlds and allow the user to take creative control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mathematics involved behind procedural generation and digital animation were complex and difficult to implement. However, we were able to persevere and complete our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of effectively incorporating the LeapMotion sensor into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through creating our project, we learned about the importance of good software engineering practices to allow the team to continue to collaborate together in programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Motivity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to bring our project into three dimensions for a more immersive experience.
