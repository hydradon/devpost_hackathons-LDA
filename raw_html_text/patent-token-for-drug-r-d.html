                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2015, scientific journals published 1.2 million medical research papers, but only 396 potential drugs were submitted to U.S. regulators for permission to begin human testing. This project is aiming to channel blockchain innovations into addressing this infamous &ldquo;Death Valley&rdquo; of drug Research &amp; Development.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our dapp allows a drug company to solicit results from research teams using a token-based incentive model. The Drug Company initializes a task with a fixed token salary, and the Research Team which provides the highest-scoring solution is granted this salary.
This token-based incentive system provides drug companies with a traceable, non-monetary way to grant equity to participants in research projects &ndash; a platform which can scale to potentially hundreds of parties.
