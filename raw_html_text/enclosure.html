                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enclosure defined by Wikipedia: Enclosure (sometimes inclosure) was the legal process in England during the 18th century of enclosing a number of small landholdings to create one larger farm.[1] Once enclosed, use of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made this into a fun, beautiful and addicting game. Like farmers occupying their land using fences, players compete by enclosing as many land as possible; there&rsquo;s limited move each round, and who gains most land wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is designed with simple rules, but it&rsquo;s greatly challenging and fun. Go or Backgammon players can find this game familiar, so easy to play but still challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enclosure is round-based. Each term players have a finite amount of fences that they can setup each round, connected head to tail, that can be used to enclose a space and score.

                    There are 3 stages of the game: Rural Land, Farm &amp; Village and War &amp; Chaos. The complexity of the game increase along with the stage number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rural Land: Lands are rural and their are values are approximately the same. ------ The score for capturing each land is 1. Each user would setup 3 consecutive fences in his/her turn.
                    <br>
                    Farm &amp; Village: The value of land differs as economic grow. Areas with village and farms appreciates, compare to desolated lands. ------ The score for capturing each area differs.
                    <br>
                    War &amp; Chao: As the number of remaining land decreases, landlord start accelerate the enclosure while fighting against each others. ------- Movement speed increase &ldquo;M+&rdquo; and Bomb &ldquo;B&rdquo; areas are added to the game. By capturing each &ldquo;M+&rdquo; area, player can set up 1 more fence in each setup, with a maximum of 5. By capturing each &ldquo;B&rdquo; area, player will instantly gain all the 8 surrounded land (regardless of whether the opponent has enclosed the land).

                <p>
                    We build the game with iOS and swift. Most of the user interface and game framework is build with native UIKit SDK. We used socket io (

                    After letting 30+ people tryout the game, we're proud to find that people likes it VERY MUCH!
                    <br>
                    Not a single person have problem understanding the game. People get addicted to it after playing with it for a while.

                    Game design in a complex piece of art. Best board games usually have following features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        rules that are simple and easy to understand (flat learning curve)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fairness between first hand and second hand
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        great space for implicit strategic maneuver

                    While developing Enclosure, we&rsquo;ve constantly letting people play with it and improve our gaming.

                    What's next for Enclosure: The Beautiful and Addicting Board Game

                <p>
                    It would be very challenging to design an AI for Enclosure, because in each state, the number of possible action for the agent is huge.
