                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PhilFindr uses the Pebble to get your geolocation in order to inform you of service opportunities around you.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it all in Javascript, using the Pebble SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time building a Pebble Application, so it was a big learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud we were able to put together a real app that works, and that could potentially help people on campus do service in the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to develop for the Pebble.
                </p>

                    What's next for PhilFindr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand our database of service opportunities, and move our product to bigger cities like Chicago. As well  as we hope to eventually release a mobile version.
