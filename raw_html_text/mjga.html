                <p>
                    Have you ever lost your friend in rock concert, shopping mall or in Junction? And end up searching them for quite a while? Or have you ever waited in a line for hours and hours? So basicaly we were inspired by the long lines to get the food that we did not get, the constant mentor hunting and the ability to spend countless hours searching, waiting and looking.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using RFID tags provided by FinnID
By using ProximiIo tracking functions
By consuming countless liters of coffee, tea and energy drinks
By arguing between ourselves when we couldn't find a solution to a problem or were just cranky and starving
By making our bodies exhausted to the level that coding was done in autopilot - thats why results are like they are
