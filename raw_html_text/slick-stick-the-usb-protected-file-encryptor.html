                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our interest in cybersecurity and cryptographic functions. We want to break into an industry that has relatively few internship positions and/or starting job opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slick Stick uses advanced cryptography techniques to transform any USB into a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device for your files. You can encrypt any file of your choosing and secure it and its contents, thus protecting your data. You will just need to plug in your MFA USB and enter in your password to access the encrypted files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slick Stick was developed with a Python back-end and PySimpleGUI for the user interface as part of Oakland University&rsquo;s GirzzHacks 4 Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into troubles developing the GUI, trying different frameworks such as tkinter but we eventually found PySimpleGUI to simplify the UI design process. We also had a lot of errors of mismatching data types and interconnecting different files, however we pulled through and squashed all the bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Python to an extent to finish this project, getting introduced to cryptography and making a fully functional application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both gained more experience in Python, cryptography, learned how to make .exe files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slick Stick - The USB protected file cryptographer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the potential of this application, we can continue development to add more capabilities such as an improved UI, and better encryption techniques.
