                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to get rid of the worry of being uncertain if our friends got home and at the same time free individuals from the responsibility of having to let people know when they've arrived at their destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Notifies the people you choose via text once you've arrived at your selected destination, be it home or elsewhere. If you don't arrive in-time, HereNow sends out a text saying they should perhaps be concerned about the late arrival.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With built it using Android Studio, Java, Google Places API, and Google Location Services.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    Getting Geofences to work properly and getting the eventHandler to fire.

                <p>
                    How far we got with the Android app and the progress we made with the iOS app given how late we started it.
                </p>
