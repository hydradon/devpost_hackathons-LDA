                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a Predix solution to cater to multi-modal city ecosystem. The solution enables - 
    ⁃ Predicts potential emergency situations arising due to water contamination or hazardous waste not attended 
    ⁃ Integration across public utility services to hospitals to transportation systems
    ⁃ Alerting to manage to the emergency responses
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart Water, Smart Waste,  Smart Mobility, Smart Healthcare modules of the solution enables enables smart localities across the city. 
Smart Water - Enables monitoring of water reservoirs for the pH, turbidity, chlorine &amp; uranium impurities
Smart Waste - Enables monitoring of the garbage bins across the city for the fill level &amp; and generation of any hazardous elements
Smart Healthcare - Monitors the occupancy level at the hospitals &amp; the critical medicines inventory
Smart Mobility - Monitors the garbage collection vehicle, City bus, fire truck locations. Helps to optimize the route for the garbage collection vehicles; helps the community residents to select the right mode of transport

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TCS team decided to build the solution on the  &ldquo;Intelligent Environment&rdquo; theme. The team started with brainstorming session listing the key needs to develop a smart community. We developed the solution using Predix components, Intel Edison, sensors, etc. The key Predix services from the catalog used for the solution are - UAA, Asset, Timeseries, Postgres. Team has also developed analytics services to predict the Risk score of the water contamination &amp; waste management. We also integrated the application with weather &amp; map APIs.
