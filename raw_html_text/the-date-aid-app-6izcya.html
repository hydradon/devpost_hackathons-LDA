                <p>
                    Date Aid is not only an excellent dating app but is also your assistant who helps you decide the perfect outfit, the perfect restaurant with the perfect ambiance and the perfect question to ask at the perfect time. The app takes in the user&rsquo;s personal information such as their hobbies, occupation, education, personality types, dietary restrictions and so on; with this information, it gives advice on whichever aspect the user specifies at any point. The app itself is user-friendly and is therefore very simple to use. Through a series of questions that the user will be answering, the app generates a list of friendly suggestions that solve their problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you are seeking a casual fling or trying to find the perfect someone, many of us cannot help but get a little nervous and hesitant when it comes to speaking, deciding what to eat, what to wear when communicating on a dating site. If you are somewhat familiar with how such app operates, you can imagine that many people will be a little frustrated when getting stuck on deciding what to say during an online chat, what to wear to a special date, picking a place to eat or even a location to bond. We understand that often the conversation flows more naturally than expected, but sometimes, not so much. and when it comes to that sticky situation, we can all use a little help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: if the user is wondering where to eat on a date, with the single click of a button, Date Aid will generate a list filtering the type of restaurants the user prefers that matches with the ones their date prefers. The user can further filter these results based on their preferred locations. Another incredible feature of Date Aid is that it is able to suggest what to say during a live conversation. The app detects some keywords from the last line spoken by the other person in their conversation, with these keywords as well as both user&rsquo;s profiles, Date Aid generates a list of possible topics and/or replies when the user is engaging in a live conversation with another user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The algorithms used to filter these results are slightly beyond our capabilities at the moment and with limited time, we are unable to come up with a complete, fully functioning demo of how the app works. We apologize in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were challenged by the process of making an actual app due to our lack of experiences in such field; also as this is our first hackathon, we were feeling quite nervous. However, through this experience, we have become familiar with the technical details and process of creating an app; having been programming singularly (no pun intended) until this event, we have both learned to cooperate with each other.
