                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As involved college students, we realized the lack of a communication medium between organizations on campus. By providing a platform for efficient collaboration, these organizations can provide services for each other, each providing specialized services or resources for others. We were also inspired by the students who lead the nationwide "March for Our Lives" movement. The impact made by the Parkland Shooting survivors was echoed throughout the country, and we wanted to create something to encourage students to continue to use their power for social change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a time where students are taking political matters into their own hands, collaboration between student organizations is key. The most successful and socially impactful movements are lead by organizations who banded together for one cause. Movement is designed to motivate communication between organizations who seek social change. It allows a user to either create a page for their organization and the services they can provide, or to pick an "action" they wish to accomplish that other organizations can assist with. For instance, a club wants to host an event but does not have anyone with much technical/logistical experience for the event, and does not have enough volunteers for the scale of the event. They can use the app to find other clubs that might be able to help, from building a website for the event and running the check-in process to providing volunteers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using IntelliJ we initially planned to build the website's frontend with Bootstrap or Angular, but had to drop the plan and build a single simple css stylesheet. We had started but did not complete implementing Google Cloud's IAM to allow users to log into the app. Instead, we used Tomcat's JDBC Realm authentication to allow users to save their login and account info in a MySQL database when they create an account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While both of us were familiar with web development with JavaScript and CSS, we had not worked with Angular or Bootstrap before and the time constraints prevented us from fully integrating it, although it could definitely be added in future iterations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very pleased with the concept and its potential impact. We strongly believe that Movement can assist and encourage activist work among students. We believe it has the potential to stray students away from the simple article shares on facebook, and motivate them to take action for the change they believe in.
We are also proud of our overall design aesthetic. Choosing a simple color scheme and font family, we were able to design an impactful, yet minimal GUI. We chose the colors: red, black, and white; we hoped these colors would signify action and strength. The contrast between the colors emphasizes the energy of our cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of setting tasks in a self-designed project. Starting on a software project from scratch can create chaos. It is important to simplify the mission of the program, and divide the tasks among the team members to get work done. This technique is known as compartment-based development under the agile development model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we did not complete many of the features we set out to complete, we are very excited and personally invested in our idea. We're both heavily involved as executive board members of various organizations in our respective universities and feel that this platform could potentially be the vital stepping stone to running better organizations and events. We are excited to continue working on Movement and see what change it can achieve in society.
