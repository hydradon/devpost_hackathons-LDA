                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was to make a robot that follows a person walking in a straight line, like a duckling following its mother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Ugly Duckling works using a sonar sensor to follow a target in a straight line and adjust its speed depending on distance from the target.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main components are an Arduino Uno, a sonar sensor and a 4-wheel chassis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges were creating the circuit, making the sensor work and making the motors work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We surprised ourselves by learning how to create a basic robot in under 24 hours with little background knowledge on computer programming or engineering. Despite issues with sections not working simultaneously/together, we are happy to have a project to learn from and build off of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From basic programming to circuity, we started as beginners and taught ourselves how to create a project. We learnt how to target our problems one at a time and solve them using limited resources  within a deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Ugly Duckling
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to build off our idea for The Ugly Duckling.
