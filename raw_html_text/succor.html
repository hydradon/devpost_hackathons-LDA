                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main flow goes as follows: User opens the mobile application and starts typing about whatever that is on their mind. The virtual assistant analyzes the incoming information by using NLP and other machine learning techniques (if were o be finished). Basically offers help by being an "active listener" and analyzing the data to offer feedback and reflections to improve user's mental health
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with designing what we wanted from the app as the end-users (specifications). We used React Native for the client-side to create the mobile application and messenger platform for communication between the user and the individual. The server is hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The messenger platform was very challenging to get started with. However, due to the extremely well documentation, we were able to grasp the fundamentals of it in no time although the technicalities of it, was more difficult than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the accomplishments we are really proud of is that we managed to build a foundational client-side mobile application as well as the server-side using technologies that were completely new to us. And doing all that under 20 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the latest technologies such as React Native and the Messenger Platform which was very different than some of the already known technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for succor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to finish the fundamentals of what succor was initially created for which is to help individuals live their best lives by offering guidance and an objective perspective through active listening and nonjudgemental feedback.
