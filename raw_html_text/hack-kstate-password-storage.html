                    I always forget my login information, and I am aware that solutions already exists, but I thought it would be fun to develop my own solution that I can use. It is not very secure, but alas, it is what I could do in a few days.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of problems. Originally, my partner and I were working on 2 different sides of the project, mine was the GUI interface, his was working with Twilio to work on accessing the project from a cell phone. However, putting our two projects together, we ran into many issues. So, after hours of debugging, we decided to split up our projects. It makes our overall work a little less interesting, but it happens.
