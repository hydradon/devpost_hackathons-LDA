                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In response to the recent sexual assault cases on campus, we decided that there was a pressing need to create an app that would be a means for people to seek help from those around them, mitigating the bystander effect at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our cross-platform app allows users to send out a distress signal to others within close proximity (up to a five mile radius), and conversely, allows individuals to respond to such SOS calls. Users can include a brief description of their distress signal call, as well as an "Intensity Rating" to describe the enormity of their current situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django as a server-side framework and hosted it using Heroku.  React Native was chosen as the user interface platform due to its cross-platform abilities.  We all shared the load of front end and back end development, along with feature spec writing and UX design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us had no experience working with React Native/Expo, so we ran into quite a few challenges with getting acclimated to the programming language. Additionally, deploying the server-side code onto an actual server, as well as deploying the application bundles as standalone apps on iOS and Android, caused us to spend significant amounts of time to figure out how to deploy everything properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the very first hackathon for the two of us (but surely, won&rsquo;t be the last!).  And, as a team, we built a full cross-platform MVP from the ground up in under 36 hours while learning the technologies used to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned technical skills (React Native), as well as more soft skills (working as a team, coordinating tasks among members, incorporating all of our ideas/brainstorming, etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SOSed Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding functionality to always send alerts to specific individuals (e.g. family, close friends) is high on the list of immediate things to add.
