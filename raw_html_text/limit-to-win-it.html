                    The Inspiration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With the construction with some incredibly DeFi products offering "interest-bearing tokens", such as Compound's cTokenx (including cWBTC), Synthetix' SUSD that can be printed with its SNX token, and bZx's iTokens, these tokens interplay with Kyber's Limit Order functionality in a super unique way
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, users can utilize Kyber's limit order functions to fill orders based on interest rate targets, rather than time, as the limit orders are able to stay open.
                    <br>
                    This also works for holding certain staking-supported coins, which offer rewards for holding coins, as Kyber's limit orders are non-custodial, users can hold the limit order while earning rewards in the meantime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer a tool to spit out the exact parameters needed to construct a Kyber Limit Order to execute the desired interest bearing strategies, and introduce the potential to automatically take interest and lever up on it, in the future using Fulcrum bZx tokens or buying cETH &amp; levering on Compound.

                <p>
                    I worked with the Kyber API to get current prices of the underlying tokens, Compound's API to collect prices and conversion rates to the main base token from the cToken, bZx's iDai token for interest (as well as future plan for buying pToken with excess interest rewards), and synthetix's SNX token (from a staking perspective) to create many limit order outputs that could be fed to execute the limit order function on the Kyber API.

                This hack still has a ways to go to finish pushing everything to the LIMIT.  
Future improvements (more to add):

*   In the future, we'd like to have a Kill order feature if the interest rate changes by more than a certain limit;
