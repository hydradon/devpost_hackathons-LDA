                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My sister recently moved cities and had trouble finding reputable places to donate old clothes and food stuffs. I wanted to create a site that brings donations into a simple, easy to use interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a city and donation type, the site displays an interactive Google Map that marks nearby location drop offs for the selected item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used html and javascript to determine what options the user has selected and then display a corresponding map from one of 14 in a database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted to be able to enter a zipcode to receive a map of nearby locations, but I'm not sure if this is even possible. What ended up having to be done was a select few cities having their map embedded in the page. I'm still struggling to host my site to my domain using amazon, as it takes up to 24 hours for the nameservers to update.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it's not super pretty, I think the site functions well and has basic design principles. The maps are interactive and show a lot of possible donation sites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had NEVER used html or css beforehand, so I picked up a fair bit of knowledge in terms of that. It's a simple site and the backend is messy, but I'm proud I got it together okay
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd like to implement a way to search for volunteer opportunities, maybe even forum posting for specific families in need
