                    After spending some time thinking of innovative ideas to improve cyber security, we chose an idea pertaining to passcodes. We realized that a lot of people use the same passcode for all their accounts and in many cases that passcode is not very difficult to hack. Passwords that are complex with multiple combinations of numbers and letters are extremely hard to remember, let alone use for multiple accounts. We came up with an innovative app that asks a series of personal questions, and scrambles the answers into a complex password. We used Swift to create the app, while using html and css to create a complimentary website for the app.
