                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating health care into our daily lifestyles that follows a consumer market trend in the health care industry.

                    How it Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fitcentive is the go-to app that allows you to manage your active lifestyle better with fitness activities and recommended meals that fit your profile no matter where you are. Use Fitcentive to meet up with friends to get you the best deals to the trendiest gyms, as well as access to state-of-the-art equipment, and group exercise classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fitcentive users can log in with a social media platform (ex: Facebook or Google+), and they will be able to see what classes/events their friends are interested in. They can also set daily goals for a healthy lifestyle. Once the daily goal is met, the member will earn "Thrive Tokens" that can be used for discounts or perks from Fitcentive partners such as discounts on gym memberships or free physical training lessons.

                    Challenges We Ran Into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                Transitioning from an Android app to a mobile webapp.
                            </strong>
                            The Android SDK was gorgeous (according to our developer), but it just took us too much time to get some things done. Plus, webapps are cross-platform!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <strong>
                                Designing an elegant user interface, look, and feel.
                            </strong>
                            At the start of the project we decided to follow
                            <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">
                                Material Design
                            </a>
                            principles, because of their ease-of-use and familiarity to mobile users.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a tool that integrates the social aspect of fitness and provides incentives to get fit and be proactive about their health. Our mobile app caters to the new, non-traditional consumer and we're proud of that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on a team is hard, but it allows for the development of a better overall product because multiple individuals working on the problem (each with their own unique skill set) mean that the app is more well-rounded and global than if an individual was developing it. Plus, it's less work for everybody!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fitcentive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we get the chance, we will be developing Android and iOS versions of Fitcentive, because while Web is great, mobile users want mobile apps. Fortunately, some of the technology we use in the webapp (Microsoft Azure) is cross-CROSS-platform and we can keep using it without changing a line of code!
