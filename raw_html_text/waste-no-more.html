                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to save the environment by reducing food waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Assistant will track expiration dates of food items in a refrigerator and can answer whether a specific item is in the refrigerator as well as tell which items are expiring soon. This way, a user can query their fridge remotely (e.g. at the grocery store) and will not overbuy food and have to throw some out. A user can also use this Google Assistant action to get an idea of a meal to make out of foods that will expire soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Actions and Dialogflow consoles as well as JavaScript we uploaded for Dialogflow to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have use JavaScript extensively (or recently), so we had several bouts of syntax struggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to wrap our heads around what was going on and what we needed to do to get the results we wanted. We certainly learned something, which was our main goal. We're pretty proud that we have a working product despite almost giving up a few times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How Google Assistant and similar services work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Waste No More
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know we have a few special use cases we still have to take care of, so those are the top priority. Next, we want to work with displays, such as showing refrigerator items in a scrollable list.
