                    Inspiration For the last few years I have worked at the rehab department. During my work, I have many amazing individuals that inspired me to do well and changed my whole perspective on what a challenge really is. Each and every individual I have is waiting for the chance to come and give back to the community. For that, I hope to empower them to be able to just do that.
