                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had wanted to create this for awhile, and was pushed in to last minute action, My daughter loves doing her nighttime yoga, but is easily distracted and often goes on tangents so, normal video guided yoga just wasn't cutting the mustard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yawning Yoga offers a guided yoga flow that you can move through at your own pace, suitable for children and the adults in their lives.  Learn yoga poses, routines and self-soothing techniques, all geared towards relaxing the body and mind, and focusing attention to support restful sleep and well being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These techniques are presented using child-friendly language, fun rhymes and familiar concepts - from animals and aspects of the natural world, to the odd alien and fast car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of each pose, Alexa will listen for you to say &ldquo;next&rdquo; or &ldquo;ready &rdquo;.If you need more time, no problem, when Yawning Yoga closes it remembers where in the flow you are up to, you can get straight back to it by saying &ldquo;Alexa, ask Yawning Yoga to continue&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alexa, ask Yawning Yoga to go to next&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New themed routines are added regularly. Save the ones you enjoy to your favourites list and personalise your experience. You can also create random flows with the number of poses you want. Soon, you&rsquo;ll be able to your their very own flows from scratch!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With node.js, Airtable API , ASK an APL there was a lot of coffee involved too,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL was tricky to get my head around, can't wait for the implementation of a drag and drop editor :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am pleased that all of the data, is pulled in from Airtable. Which has a simply delightful user interface which allows no-tech people to contribute with out too much trouble. It also has quite a lot of variance and randomisation to offer a hopefully fun interaction, I am also pleased with the extensible nature of how it is written adding new features ( like switching to using a yoga instructors voice ) will be straight forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much node.js that I didn't know before. 
That it's really easy to get carried away with "cool features" when it's probably more important to focus on getting the essential stuff frictionless.
                </p>

                    What's next for Yawning Yoga
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am working with some yoga instructors to add there own flows, using there voice instead of Alexas, 
I have a couple of features that just weren't going to be implemented in time but are really close, including. 
building your own flows. 
getting Alexa to give you  a set amount of waiting time ( up to 4 minutes ) 
getting a random flow generated
Better ux around the saving of flows and the representation of flows available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also investigating sharing created flows. 
I will putting out new poses and flows regularly. 
I want to improve the appearance/style.
