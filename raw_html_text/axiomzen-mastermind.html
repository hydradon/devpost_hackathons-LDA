                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to complete the challenge using the minimum necessary tools, and some creativity. Although I'm a .Net developer using an array of different technologies, there was no need for .Net, MVC, SQL databases or else.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It consumes the REST webservice API, as explained in the challenge specs at:

                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had the idea of using just JQuery for the most part of it, for the sake of simplicity. Once I got the responses from the API, it was just a matter of arranging things on the screen.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make the game easy to play, knowing that most mastermind games have less than 8 colors and positions to choose. The objective was to make it playable and the same time be able to finish the game in the less amount of time possible.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to complete the challenge in less time than expected and with little difficulty.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, I'll try to make the CSS better, and put some pictures, in other words, to focus more on the designer part.

                    Testing It

                <p>
                    It's at GitHub, about 100k, there's no need to compile anything, just download and run.
