                    People are constantly faced with the problem of comparing two things. Our project is just for this purpose. We want to develop an APP so that people can directly see the comparison between two things in one shot, as opposed to searching for each of the two things and make summary about their differences. Also, people can see how other people feel about the comparison with our APP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our APP, users can act as either one of two roles: askers and answerers. If one user has any question about a specific comparison between two things, they will act as askers. To be specifically, they will first see a direct and objective comparison of the two things, with regard to the difference of the attributes of the two things. After that, they will see the survey of the comparison among other users. If one user want to answer other people's questions, they act as the answerers. In that case, they will see a list of questions. And this order of the list for every answerer is customized using recommendation system algorithm(to be specific, matrix decomposition) so that the questions the users are more likely to answer will be ordered at higher rank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have used Jax-rs to build the restfull application in java and flask to build restfull app in flask. Wolfram alpha api has been used to retrieve comparable information about the questions asked by the user.Rest calls also exist to create new question and submitting responses for a question. Matrix reduction has been used to get the recommended tasks for the user based on previous submitted responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned machine learning algorithms, Flask, using the Wolfram alpha API and language in this project.

                    The next for ThisNThat is to integrating the UI and backend server.
