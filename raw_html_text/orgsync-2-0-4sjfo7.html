                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current design for the UC Davis Clubs and Organizatios search tool was poorly designed and difficult to use. (

                    ) we decided to make it easier for users to use.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an organized list of clubs and organizations on campus.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time scrapping through data of the various clubs and organization that were already present on the old search tool.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never created a website before or combed through data. It was a difficult challenege but it was enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picked up a lot of web development skills.

                <h2>
                    What's next for OrgSync 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to integrate a social aspect to the search tool. We plan to present which clubs are the most popular, how to get involved, who to contact and also which clubs you could be interested in based on the people you know (facebook integration maybe?) and the other clubs you are interested/subscribed to.
