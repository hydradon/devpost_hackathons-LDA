                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the SXSW Hackathon, music experts explained the dilemma facings the industry as artists now create music at
an unprecedented rate. Disrupting the historical context of a label. We wanted to create an avatar that helped artist and labels strategize better.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual A&amp;R leverages trusted industry API's such as Buzz Angle Music and QLOO to predict an artist's success based on trending indicators in real-time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using AWS, QLOO for artist recommendations, and Buzz Angle to analyze artist statistics.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the recommendations didn't make sense so I found the use case of Movie to Artist suggestions which did.
