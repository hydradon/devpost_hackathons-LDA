                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After driving over a pothole recently, I had to spend a lot of money and time to fix my broken suspension system. Furthermore, I learned that potholes are commonly rated among the top annoying things. This inspired me to develop an IoT solution for detecting all the potholes and pi-pointing them on a map. This way the drivers can be notified in advance if they are about to cross a pot-hole. Furthermore, the responsible parties can use this information to fix the pot-holes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device detects the pothole using a vibration sensor. Once the sensor is triggered, the system records the GPS co-ordinates and send the data to an AWS server for recording the pothole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is programmed on a Qualcomm DragonBoard IoT device with a 96Boards shield. Using a vibrator sensor the system will detect the pothole. The device then sends the GPS coordinates of the pot-hole to an AWS server for analyses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spot the Pothole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system can be scaled to the whole population. With that amount of data coming from every single used, the possibilities are endless.
