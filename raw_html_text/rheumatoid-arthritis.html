                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a 20+ year cancer survivor, Ken understands what a patient diagnosed with a chronic condition goes through. Their life is forever changed and simple easy access to information about their diagnosis and medication is critical for patients to truly understand what life has in store for them. Just being able to hear, nausea is normal side effect and a change of eating habits might help is more than a hack it is truly a lifeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vohesu&rsquo;s Voice First, Diagnosis Navigation Platform, helps Healthcare providers, who want to improving patient health literacy and reduce healthcare costs, by improving patient lifestyle choices, and medication adherence, where and when they need it, at home or on the go, all via VOICE!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a third party product ConversationOne to develop the solution. This provides me with the ability to develop on a single platform and push the solution to Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Facebook Messenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not a "developer" so some of the more technical development is a stretch for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill, of course! There is a version live right now, however we are working on updates this month that will improve the breadth of services before the application deadline. The improvements we added for this challenge are the side effect information and management modules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, as a company I am proud that we have a booth at the Collision conference in NOLA this May and we will be attending VOICE Summit in NJ this July.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future is VOICE! This will change how we interact with technology for years to come. Based on the work done we will be looking to expand our team to include a clinical content expert to help with research of content. The technical platform is pretty solid and we will grow as we add content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rheumatoid Arthritis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The RA skill is the first implementation of our Diagnosis Navigation Platform. The platform will support many different diagnosis, RA is just our first early adopter group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the skill we will focus on Healthy Lifestyle by delivering content for daily activities, such as exercise, healthy eating and emotional well being. This will be pushed to patients every day encouraging changes to behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving forward we will include medication reminders and prescription refills which directly address adherence
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally Surveys &ndash; which will integrate with the EMR to collect information on patient Quality of life, via a RAPID-3 or PAS, PHQ-9 Healthy Days, to measure progress before and after implementation of the solution.
