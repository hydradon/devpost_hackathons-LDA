                    Our team met on the hackathon EdHack in Mail.ru, where we build the first version of our solution and won a price with it.

                    ViaReal is a virtual reality educational project. We are making
                    <strong>
                        laboratories in VR
                    </strong>
                    to make science closer to the students. Our product is for the schools, which
                    <strong>
                        don't have any laboratory equipment
                    </strong>
                    or want to provide
                    <strong>
                        too expensively
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        large-scale
                    </strong>
                    experiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The technical part of our solution is very simple. We are using
                    <strong>
                        Unity
                    </strong>
                    to visualize all in
                    <strong>
                        HTC Vive
                    </strong>
                    . Our main feature is a
                    <strong>
                        real physics
                    </strong>
                    we use in the labs. It gets students the opportunity to provide the experiments in the
                    <strong>
                        real-time
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are going to run into
                    <strong>
                        "Your track"
                    </strong>
                    challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We won at the EdHack hackathon in "Educational project" nomination, were finalists at
                    <strong>
                        Imagine Cup Russia 2018
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        . We also participated at **WFYS 2017
                    </em>
                    * in Sochi and build the Optics laboratory for
                    <strong>
                        MSU Physics Department
                    </strong>
                    for the
                    <strong>
                        Festival of Science
                    </strong>
                    .

                    Now we are going to expand the Russian market, which is very conservative and controlled by the government.
