                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Registration times are mean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses UCLA website data to detect when classes open up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python. It was harder than it sounds, UCLA registration site is super duper messy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The relevant info doesn't directly appear in the page source. I had to intercept network communications via inspect element and figure out how to generate the correct URL.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    I finished?

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn more stuff for hackathons.

                <p>
                    Add more subjects, didn't have time to add them all.
