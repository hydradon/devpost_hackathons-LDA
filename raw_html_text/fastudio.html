                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, i was once a fashion designer and most challenge i face then was that when clients come to get a dress for themselves, i have no portfolio to showcase my work to them, and many ask me hw sure are you that you can get me this particular design. But with fastudio all my designs are setup in the cloud, i just forward my public portfolio link to them for them to feed their eyes and make decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fastudio solves the problem of looking for a qualified fashion designer to get your work done maybe when you move to a new area or other African countries and also helping and empowering the local fashion designers setup their portfolio and connect them to their potential clients (sew on the go)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fastudio was developed using the MEAN stack JavaScript web technology with Angular2+ for the frontend,  nodejs and express.js for backend hosted on heroku PaaS and mongoDB with mongoDB Atlas as DaaS with cloudinary used for storing all designs uploaded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenge i faced was migrating from mlab to mongodb atlas as i was once an mlab fan. Also i had challenges with internet connectivity as that is one of the major challenges developers face in Nigeria.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to be a mongoDB user,  and successfully setting up a mongoDB cluster on mongodb atlas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major thing i learnt was how to maximize the various mongoDB cursor for data manipulation. 
I also learnt how to integrate all the MEAN stack frameworks together efficiently and how to use cloudinary for storing data and image manipulation and verification using twillo service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fastudio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of machine learning capabilities to generate accurate measurements for clients based on input data without stressing the designers. Also empowering up coming fashion designers.
