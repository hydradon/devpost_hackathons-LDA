                    Caption This is a website application that aids hearing impaired students in understanding course materials. The website will be an open-source platform where students can upload videos of lectures and students can contribute close-captioning to these videos, where they will then be utilised by their hearing impaired peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Students will be notified through the Disabilities Resource Center (DRC) if there is a student in their class that has a hearing impairment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once given the professor's permission, students in that class will have the ability to videotape the lecture and upload it onto the web app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anyone in the community can add closed captions to the video (they can caption the entire 2 hours, or choose to caption only 2 minutes)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The closed captions will be flagged for a moderator to review.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once approved, the moderator will indicate that the video has closed captions, and students with disabilities are free to watch the video!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After watching the lecture, students will then be able to rate the quality of the closed caption video on a 5-star scale.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a video is rated less than 3 stars, the moderator will flag the video and open the video up for a re-caption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the event that a lecture does not have closed captioning, a speech-to-text function will be implemented, until it can be replaced with closed captioning.
                    </li>
                </ol>
