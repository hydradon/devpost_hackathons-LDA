                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The waiting times at the uOttawa gyms (and never knowing when its busy!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app tracks the capacity of any room using computer vision, and displays the capacity on a web app as a percentage. Each person who is identified is given an ID, and thus we only track when new people enter the field of vision of the video input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python + OpenCV library, Django
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between our program and the web app, as well as accuracy of the counter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the accuracy issues, implementing OpenCV for the first time in a project together, and learning how to set-up a web app with Django!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How powerful computer vision can be, the importance of having a strong team, and the power of collaboration (especially w/ fellow hackers - s/o to those who helped us run our test cases!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    And a LOT about web app development!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Person Counter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some other applications we thought of for this program were...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integration with security cameras (possibly snapshots of faces using feature detection?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integration all over uOttawa to help students find out where the busiest parts of campus are at each time of the day
                    </li>
                </ul>
