                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project addresses a pain point that is experienced when I had to bring my motorbike or my dad's car for servicing/maintenance. Have you wondered why a cars has to be serviced every "X" miles/kilometers? 
Well, I did. It does not make sense to me that servicing had to be determined by distance and not the car's physical condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if there is a way to identify the cars' condition? 
No surprise! The answer is yes. Professionals use car Diagnostic devices to access the car's condition. These devices require skills and experience to use them. It not for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While ideating about how to bring the solution to every car owner, CarDoc surfaced. CarDoc is a hardware-software solution that will aid car owners to save money by gathering pieces of information from different components of a car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CarDoc has 2 parts.
First is the Hardware with a processor and sensors that get fixed to a car. This hardware/device will gather data from the car and push it to the cloud.
Second is a Web App that displays insides gathered from the Data collected over time and advice the users when the car needs fixing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, the hardware used for this project should be Raspberry Pi attached to a Car Diagnostic device. Due to resource limitations, the dummy data are generated by a Python Script (GPIO Disabled). The data is pushed to firebase by the device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software will retrieve data from firebase and performs a quick analysis and recommends the user on the next set of actions. As of now, the analysis is a work in progress.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideation for this problem took longer than expected. As such, there was not much time for implementation. Only if I had all the resources required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New to Firebase. The fact that I was able to integrate Firebase into my project is a great success.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a better understanding of firebase and other Google Cloud Platforms.

                    </strong>
                    This product will close the gap between Car and Car Owners. Understanding the car will enable car owners to use their cars efficiently and save money.
