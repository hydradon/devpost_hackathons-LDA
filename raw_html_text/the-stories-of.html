                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can read about stories, but silent words can never carry emotions in the way that a voice does. You might have a very personal story that you want to share, but you want to preserve your anonymity. Maybe you are curious about how things were in a different time, or what it was like to live through a major event. 
The Stories Of is a platform where anyone can share their personal stories, and learn about others. Just like you would go to the library to read about the world, The Stories Of is a library of human experiences.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Stories Of is a platform where you can submit or read real stories from real people. 
When you contribute a story, you can do so in the format of audio, video, and or text.
When you want to listen to a story, you can search for stories of a specific subject and or time, or just browse the library. You can like and comment on the stories.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Wix Code to build a beautiful website with minimal time and added a little Google Translate for extra functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wix's Website Editor doesn't allow more than one user per project at a time, making it very hard to work as a team. Also, we were often limited by what we can do with Wix without a premium account. We couldn't even bypass the problem by implementing the desired feature ourselves because we didn't have access to the source code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered the amazing capabilities that Wix Code offer: a few clicks replaces lines of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Stories Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having Wix premium has heavily limited us in our implementation. Eventually, we want to offer our users the features (ex: recording and uploading audio from mobile) that we have omitted in this version of The Stories Of.
