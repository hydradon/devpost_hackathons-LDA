                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game called big fish small fish that we played in primary school after breaks to refresh our thinking. In that game, we follow the audio input from the game organizer. But the organizer will try to confuse us with his actions as well as flipping the meaning of the instruction he gives. In the game we developed, we follow a similar approach with the help of features available in the Bose AR Frames.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a set of instructions, namely Left, Right, Front &amp; Back. In this based on the instruction, the player needs to tilt his head in the respective direction. The confusion element is added in the form flipping the activity which the player needs to perform based on the instruction. Ex. If a command like Left and Right are flipped comes, then the player needs to tilt left, when he gets an instruction Right and vice versa. Front and Back will remain as it is. With increasing levels, the pace of instructions increase &amp; also the flipping commands come randomly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity and Bose SDK for this. As we wanted this to be more of an audio-only game, all the required commands were converted speech and played on the Bose AR Fames speaker. The instructions and data are also displayed on the screen for reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we built a game on unity. Hence, the major challenge was to figure out how to use Unity and Bose SDK to suit our goal requirements. Once we got a hang on how to use Unity, then the work progressed quickly.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a game, using an AR product within a short span of one day is a thing we would be proud of. Overcoming the challenges and seeing the idea which we thought of, getting successfully executed was the icing on the cake.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a game from scratch!. It was also a steep learning curve, with a new software learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Left is Right
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further steps would be to add more modes in the game.
1) One of the additions would be to exploit the stereo speaker and have spatial sounds which will add to the confusion. 2) The flipping pairs can be changed from not just left-right &amp; front-back to other combinations like front-left etc.
3) A memory game, where the direction to be followed will be listed out and the player has to remember it and then follow the sequence. Ex, If Left-Right-Back-Front is the sequence, then the player has to tilt his head accordingly in the sequence.
4) Even further, the flipping commands can be added to the memory game.
5) Another addition would be, adding direction like 'left-front', 'back-right' etc, instead of just left, right, front &amp; back.
