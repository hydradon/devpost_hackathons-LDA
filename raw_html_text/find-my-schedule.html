                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students ourselves, we know all too well the struggle of building a good course schedule. Very often, a course that we've added prevents us from adding other courses that we need. This leads to hours of manipulation and frustration as we try to fit all of the courses into a schedule. Even then, the end result can be sub-optimal.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads in a list of courses, finds all non-conflicting combinations and displays them on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the web tool almost entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we struggled with implementing the user interface in HTML and CSS. Additionally, finding an interesting problem to solve with our project was difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of designing an app that will be useful to our peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to better understand the limitations of client-side operations.
                </p>

                    What's next for Find My Schedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will link with school APIs to include full course catalogs. It will also expand to calculate semester-by-semester plans.
