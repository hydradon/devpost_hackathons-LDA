                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College application can be hard for first generation students, especially the ones who are financially challenged. Even in most progressive state like California, there are thousands of students who fail to join or graduate from a university. About 16.4% of Californians, i.e, more than 6 million people, live under poverty line. Since education is the key factor for escaping poverty, we wanted to help the unprivileged students get into college in an affordable manner.
