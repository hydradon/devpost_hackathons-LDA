                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group member is a t-mobile user and uses t-mobile tuesday for its rewards system. That member pointed out how lacking the app is and how it is mostly limited to the rewards. However, even then, the rewards were lacking. There was a time when tmobile offered lfyt to users in Texas when lyft was not even a thing in Texas. We discussed with each ways to improve the experience of the user on the tmobile app with a better rewards system and user experience. The result of one of our group member's frustration inspired us to program a solution about this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product serves to add functionalities to allow tmobile Tuesday to better serve its customers while being able to collect data that can improve user experience
There are two parts to our program
First part is building a community including
-general chat
-customer service
-implementing this to tmobile Tuesday allows us to take advantage of the rewards system
Second part is gathering data from our user
-the chat stores the things discussed by the users and can collect data using it
-we take the data and send it to tmobile service and organize it using charts
-the data will allow tmobile to better understand the customer and give them better rewards and services.
-setting to turn off privacy

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used HTML,CSS,JavaScript and its libraries,Jazz
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we had a hard time with Jazz, our team had difficulties with the navbar in Jazz's web template which caused us a headache to solve when we finally realized it was because of a bootstrap Jazz implemented. We also ran with issues setting up the api with Jazz so we gave up on that part. Also, we had to learn how to program our discord server accordingly so we can utilize it. Another challenge was finding the right libraries for javascript.
