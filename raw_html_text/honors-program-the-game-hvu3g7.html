                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the vibrant, upbeat community of Honors, and wanted to give back to the community with something guaranteed to make them laugh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that simulates the college life of a not-so-ordinary SIUE Honors student. Your goal is to graduate in 4 years, but the school constantly throws its many challenges at you. Navigating the school won't be easy! From classic platformers to puzzles to boss fights, this is a game you won't forget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as our game engine coded with C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was merging our work together. We each worked individually until the end, which proved to be challenging when merging it all together. We also are all relatively new to Unity, and had to learn how to build a project many of us had never had experience with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game turned out quite exceptional for something many of us had minimal experience within a 2 day period. It has a lot of unique gameplay levels and a refreshing art style. It employs visual cues from SIUE's campus and themes such as the large goose population which many students can relate to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity, but more importantly, we learned about planning, working with others, and performing under pressure. Integrating our thoughts into one coherent game has been exciting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Honors Program: The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honors Program: The Video Game is the next smash-hit on the video game market. Just you wait!
