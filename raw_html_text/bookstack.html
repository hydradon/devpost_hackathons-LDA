                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows its quite annoying to go through facebook search to try and find the textbooks you need, but some people don't, and we want to change that and make it easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app collects data from facebook (and eventually will expand for other sites) to easily search for textbooks, and can also allow you to filter for only the textbooks you need by uploading your course schedule from QUEST, making it a seamless and easy experience to connect you to the people who are selling the items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using node.js and angular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to do webscraping, and trying to make technologies do things they aren't supposed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a parsing algorithm that looks through the pasted information from QUEST and simply makes a list of courses!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots and lots of javascript and how time intensive and annoying styling can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bookstack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're aiming to integrate a lot of things into this such as gaining statistics so that we can track supply and demand of textbooks, creating or using a better algorithm for finding the correct textbooks, and adding data from other textbook sellers and resellers in order to make this a more complete experience for our users. We want our future users to want to use our app to find the best possible deal and save as much money as possible.
