                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going to work, managing kids, taking care of the household, personal skill development...a woman has multiple tasks to take care of. We observe the constant struggle of time-management and goal tracking around us all the time. Therefore, we decided to dive into this problem and creat"Smart Diary".

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Smart Diary" is a Smart Goal tracking which allows the user to record their goals which could be health, fitness, career or personal development goals. Then our algorithm keeps tracks of the goals and provides daily reports and send reminder text messages of progress and recommendations to the user. So this keeps tracks of goals, boosts confidence with a recommendation and motivates them to pursue tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Web interface using HTML, CSS, javascript that collected the information about the user goals using Typeform. Then we built a Typeform survey, where the user can track their daily goal progress. We connected the Typeform results to a Google Cloud function, which pulls in the results of the survey. The function then parses the payload, and computes the user's progress made for that day. The client makes a GET request to the Google Cloud function to obtain the progress value. The client then plots this value on the front end to show today's progress. We are further planning to use Twilio to send reminder messages to the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time developing a full stack framework and Google cloud, so we had difficulty connecting frontend to the backend and using Google Cloud functionalities. But the mentors were very helpful so we were able to solve the problem and learn.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the accomplishments that we are proud of are: Learning about Google Cloud platform, Developing a working website, and attending amazing workshops all in one day!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to hack a website and connect it to the backend. and connect various API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Diary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using voice instead of text then use Natural Language Processing to extract information. Further, use Machine Learning algorithms to track the goals that are able to produce realistic charts and recommendations. In addition to this, improving UI/UX to make it more user-friendly. We believe our app can greatly help women achieve all their goals and become successful.
