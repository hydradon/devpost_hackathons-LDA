                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanting to improve a programming language we already know or learn a new one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps a library of code samples (algorithms and data structures) to allow you to come back and practice as needed until it's fully learned. The library is organized by language and algorithms for that language are shown for you to choose from. Then you can type the code and see if you recall it correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WPF C# project for the desktop version
Android studio for the mobile app
HTML/JavaScript/Perl for the website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming sufficiently familiar with the mobile environment to replicate the functionality. Also implementing the account and library functionality on a web server.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe it's a solid idea and will continue to develop it for anyone it may help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build using WPF instead of the old drag and drop windows forms in Visual Studio. Learned more about app development.
                </p>

                    What's next for Assert Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to polish each incarnation, add Mac/iOS and Linux versions, and publish for anyone to use.
