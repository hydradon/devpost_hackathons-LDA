                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members, Nicko, received a housing citation for his house for allowing his grass to grow too long while he was attending school. He didn&rsquo;t know there was code for grass height in the city rules. In addition, we believe the city&rsquo;s pre-existing list of codes are too obtuse. Therefore, we decided to create a website that would make it simpler for homeowners to track their properties and criteria for those properties.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web portal allows homeowners to register their properties. The web portal provides active citation information from the city. Homeowners then assign tasks needs to be completed to their tenants. Tenants complete their tasks and report via web portal. In addition, the main portal provides simplified, basic code information for properties.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We employed Django as a backend framework to construct a web app with the create, read, update, delete (CRUD) features. We also enables the Master/Detail function, allowing the users to view more information that they may be interested in.  HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were utilized to develop frontend web pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges in linking the css with html through Django, in addition, there were times when the model would not properly transfer information from front end to back end in Django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn a new set of syntax in a short period of time to attempt to finish our project. Most of the team members came to the hackathon with very little knowledge of how to use Python in web development, and during the event, we discovered many things that we were not previously aware was possible. We were also able to overcome the challenge of one of our team members leaving early.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate backend and front end together using Django, as well as host it in a virtual environment in python. Most importantly, we learned how to distribute teamwork equally among members, and how to give the right work to the people fit for the task. Even though we were inexperience, good organization allowed us to finish.

                <p>
                    Integrate more personalized housing checklists, in addition, for those who are renting properties out to tenants, allow tenants to access and check off requirements the same rental properties. There will also be a way to apply for property registration digitally through the portal.
