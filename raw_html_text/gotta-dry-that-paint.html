                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was a young boy I used to be forced to paint, over and over and over again. I watched paint dry for 20 years. So I decided to create an app to alleviate my pain. GottaDryThatPaint.com is a real labor of love. I have never felt more connected emotionally and spiritually to a project before.
