                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The natural catastrophes have increased in Latin America during the last years, causing several deaths in different countries. Emergencia is an application that provides the rescuers more precise information about the victims, and also the victims have new alarms, all included in the phone, that allow them to ask for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emergencia will be connected to a national server that notifies areas of risks for the following phenomenons: volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and hurricanes. If one person is in a danger area, intermediately a button is shown in the screen of the cellphone, waiting for the person to notify her state after the disaster. If the person notifies a OK state, then a map with the location of people in danger will be displayed for a possible collaboration. If the Person does not confirm an OK state, then the rescuers are notified with the last position reported by the cellphone, also the mobile activities sound and light alarms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android application is in communication with a centralized server that contains the information about the natural disasters. For the server php and mysql were used to process, store, and share the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let the application running in background, and only be displayed in case of emergency needs further work since was not possible to complete for this time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have an application in constant communication with a centralized server that makes the user interact with an application, as it will work in an emergency case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we learned about the low number of applications that exists to help people in case of emergencies, there is a great area of opportunity to contribute in this area.
In technical details, the usage of mobile's sensors and actuators, was well as the communication with servers is something all the time need to learned due to the low experience in andorid platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergencia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep growing in the collaboration of the community, for example, people could report disasters still unknown by national institutions.
