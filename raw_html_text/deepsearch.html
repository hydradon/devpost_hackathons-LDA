                    Sonobi's Social Blog Dataset was enormous and contained very interesting information about the user base and their activities. I wanted to use my data mining and analytical skills to extract the useful information out of the dataset
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The program uses Python's external library Pandas and Numpy to logically organize the data into DataFrames which allow easy data extraction and manipulation. A number of functions provide various statistical analysis and are easily scalable
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Python, Pandas, Numpy, HTML and a lot of energy drinks
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Since time was extremely limited and I was the only member of the team, data cleanup took a lot of time. Most of the problems emerged from the "nan" values in the dataset.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    So far, information about 26811 bloggers is in the DataFrames from which any data can be extracted or added easily
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I have practiced my Python skills and learned a lot more about Pandas and Numpy
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am going to make the project open-source so that other people could use it to read, sort and analyze their datasets easily. If issues arise, I will keep improving the code.
