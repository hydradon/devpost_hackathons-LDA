                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4/5 of the team are international students and it is a little awkward to approach people when making new friends, especially because our English skills aren't proficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you make an account, you have to add your hobbies and a bio which can help others approach you through similar interests. After logging into your account, you will see a map where it shows all the people who are within a 30 feet radius from you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for GUI &amp; total integration and Firebase for authentication of email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GUI was a bit of a problem and our initial design was very different from our end result. Additionally, reading from the Firebase real-time data base was a challenge. Lastly, our map is being refreshed with new users every 20-30 seconds instead of being in real-time.
                </p>

                    Getting real time updates to work, improving the GUI, integrating messaging and profile pictures, including the exact location of a potential friend (in front or behind you).
