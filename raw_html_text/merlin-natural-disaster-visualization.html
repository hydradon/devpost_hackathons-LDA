                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hurricanes are an increasingly serious problem due to global warming. We want to improve response times and response execution by providing analytics to governments and aid organizations.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Satellite images are segmented by a machine learning algorithm and classified into destroyed/intact sections. We find the area of destruction and multiply by the prices corresponding per those areas at those areas.
