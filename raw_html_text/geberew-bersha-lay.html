                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no aggregated data for the small holder farmers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farmers are having low productivity due to the lack of proper knowledge of farming. Soil fertility, humudity and temperature sensors will be used to check the fertility of the soil in order for the farmers to make sure the soil is ready for plowing. The location sensors will help us know how big of a land the farmer has. All the aggregated data will help us in getting prepared with the amount of inputs needed for the farmers, the amount of yield to be collected which will eventually help us predict other necessary factors like logistics, insurance and banks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data collection happens on the field which will be delivered via sms or internet. Which will get to the cloud and get back to the farmer and extension worker via sms or internet.
