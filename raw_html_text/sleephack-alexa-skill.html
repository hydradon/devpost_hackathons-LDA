                    The idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone sleeps. It's pretty important, but most people don't know how to do it properly; there's more to it than just lying in bed and hoping for the best. I've always had an interst in the idea of 'sleep hygiene', but have found that many people don't know what it is, let alone how to do it properly. With good sleep hygiene, I've found that I fall asleep faster, sleep more soundly, and wake up feeling more alert and ready for the day. Thus, I wanted to build a skill to share these tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides many random tips and hacks on how to improve all aspects of sleep, including how to fall asleep faster, how to wake up feeling better, and how to sleep more soundly.
It is built using an AWS Lambda endpoint written in Node.js, and the Alexa skills kit. I used my previous experience with fact skills to build this one faster and with less hassle.

                <h2>
                    The future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The obvious advancement of the skill is to add more tips. As well as that, there is the possibility of adding timing functionality to help track how much sleep the user gets each night. Additionally, seperating the tips into categories ("falling asleep", "waking up", etc.) may be sensible when more tips are added, to make it easier for the user to get the advice they want.
