                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently wrote a program to solve Sudoku puzzles and was inspired to begin working on something similar for chess, a game that I enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently allows for two players to play a game of chess together in terminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the program in a .cpp file using c++, the code is class and struct based, with an emphasis on a game class that holds most of the functions / variables for the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating valid moves for pieces that could be anywhere on the board, determining collision and blocking of movements, as well as managing the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to write more complex code than is usually expected from my classes, and being able to utilize and design the code I made to be reusable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to color code text, manage larger classes and handle more complex data structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RvB Chess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More testing needs to be done to verify that the pieces can and will only perform legal moves.
I also plan to add a basic chess engine that would allow for a player to face against the computer.
