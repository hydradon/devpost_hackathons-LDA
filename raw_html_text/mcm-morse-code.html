                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Is there something that represents technology and visions at the same time? Well, we found Morse Code! You will sense the beauty of Morse code after your words, phrases or sentences are translated and visualized in our web project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translating words, phrases or sentences into Morse Code and visualize it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eclipse Dynamic Web Project, including MVC model (model-view-controller), Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translating Morse Code! Also specifically we couldn't get audio to work properly in Java so we ended up using JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Users can not only see their Morse Code, but also HEAR it! 2) It has a beautiful user interface and is developed solely by three girls who just started coding for less than a year!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Enhancement of Java, JavaScript and MVC model 2) Implement visual and audio files in a Java project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Morse Code Mechanism (MCM)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a bot that can not only translate Morse Code, but also interact with the user! Also we are looking into a platform that could support our java server application online
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Morse Code Mechanism (MCM) first made its debut at a small Hackathon about a month ago.  We managed to accomplish a lot with the first version of MCM, but we wanted to improve on what we had and expand MCM's functionalities.  The link below is just one of the ways we have improved MCM-by moving it from our local server and putting it on a domain that everyone can see using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  Although it is not perfect and there are plenty of bugs that we are still working on regarding audio and online live deployment, with these improvements we are able to create a representation for a language that is typically only audible.
