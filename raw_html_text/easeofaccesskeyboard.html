                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help out the visually impaired type - as typing is the prominent way to communicate through technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an Applet that displays JButtons with custom ImageIcons, and when pressed - the keyboard will say the letter that is pressed. This way the user can experiment and type with the applet open and learn the  location of all the keys on the keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a problem in embedding the Applet into the actual webpage because the class file could not be directed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we could help the blind learn how to type on a keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement sounds inside applets and embed Applets into HTML code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EaseOfAccessKeyboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can potentially run this alongside, say Microsoft Word, so the keyboard would say whatever the user is typing in ANY application.
