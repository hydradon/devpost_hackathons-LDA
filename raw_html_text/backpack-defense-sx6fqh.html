                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a solution the the unfortunately widespread problem of theft on college campuses.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon turning the device on, an alarm will trigger if the device is removed from its original location.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino Nano paired with an accelerometer. We used the Arduino to measure how far the accelerometer had traveled, which would in turn trigger an alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, the accelerometer would produce unnatural values when at rest. Because of this, we had to calibrate the device. In addition, we needed to avoid small movement values from impacting the device, which would cause accidental triggers. Using calibration and a little bit of math, we were able to successfully avoid these issues.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully completing a project and building it with a team. We think the idea is very applicable to students and could be widely used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We received hands-on experience with bread boarding, coding, and soldering. We learned teamwork skills while exploring innovative solutions to our problems.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, there was only one type of speaker offered at the IdeaHacks, which we would hopefully replace with a louder one. With more time, hopefully the project could be streamlined and made even more compact.
