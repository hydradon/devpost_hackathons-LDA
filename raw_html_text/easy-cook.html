                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all been there. We find this pretty recipe from Facebook on our phones and start cooking. Your phone timeouts after a minute, and you try to unlock your phone using your fingerprint but your phone refuses to accept it because your fingers are covered with flour. You try to type in your passcode and now your screen is unresponsive. We wanted to fix that so we made "Easy Cook"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an Alexa Skill that runs in the cloud that reads out recipes to you. You just say "Alexa, open Easy Cook". And then you can ask it to find recipes as well as browse through them. The cool thing is that it gives you instructions step by step and you can ask it to go next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Alexa skill by drawing out the intents we wanted and then used those to figure out all the different uttering. We found a website that provided good recipes and made a scraper in Python using Beautiful Soup, and coded the service in Python as well and uploaded it to Amazon Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had used Alexa before so the interface was very new for us. It took a while to read through the documentation and learn how it worked. AWS Lambda was a tough one to understand and make it work. The debugging was pretty hard for Alexa.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we made a very usable Alexa skill.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a completely new interface - Voice User Interface. It was really fun to experiment and code for it.

                <p>
                    We want to make a companions iOS app to upload the recipe.
