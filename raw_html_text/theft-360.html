                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laptops get stolen very often at UCLA libraries, I wanted to solve this problem once and for all. What better way than to do this at a hackathon which forces you to do as much as you can in 12 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just place your phone on your belongings, any motion to pick it up (however gently) will be detected. Or enable the pickpocket mode and place it in your pocket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ignoring taps. Detecting actual movements. Getting info from the accelerometer and proximity sensor. Watch connectivity is a challenge I still have to overcome
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accurately detecting movements, distinguish between consecutive taps and a swift movement. Making it alone so far in this project in 12 hours. Being able to give it a decent design in such a short time after designing the UI in Sketch.
