                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to use the Nest Camera to help firefighters find victims in a house fire efficiently, but due to hardware and internet malfunctions we decided to focus on the post side of these events; finding funding to help these victims rebuild their homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Donate Stream allows users to donate money to a cause via a hash tag or a tweet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used the Twitter API to access certain tweets associated with the donation fund, the Capital One API to access financial accounts, and the Twilio API for notifications and authentications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet was a huge struggle and setback. We wanted to use the camera, but we also wanted to be able to create something despite our setbacks, so we focused on a software approach. The Capital One API took alot of team work and problem solving to get through, but thanks to the lovely mentors we were able to get basic functions working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to adapt to a new language and use of API calls, which is the basis of our apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot of problem solving skills, how to use Python and integrate it with API's, as well as how to work as team in terms adapting our ideas and skillsets to the limited time frame that we had!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Donate Stream
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue to have our app fully deployed with full integration of the Twitter, Capital One, and Twilio API; aiming to help non profits and donation funds use social media to collect funds for their cause.
