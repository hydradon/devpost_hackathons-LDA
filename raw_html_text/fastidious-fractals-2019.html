                    We were inspired by the beauty and majesty of the naturally-occurring order.

                    This website provides a simple and elegant way of learning about fractals and how they work.

                    We built this website by dividing up the work and collaborating based on our strengths and weaknesses.

                    Isaac: I ran into difficulties with the formatting of the header and iframe elements of the page where the auto-align didn't align the header's image correctly and the frame wouldn't connect to YouTube.
Tori: I struggled with the understanding behind some of the artificial fractals, especially when explaining Mandelbr&ouml;t's set.
Ben: Having virtually no prior experience with javascript, I struggled to learn the functions and limitations of the canvas element. Thankfully, Isaac took care of the web layout. I ended up pulling an all-nighter getting the engine done, but DANG was is cool to see a dragon curve pop outta nowhere. I wish we'd spent a bit more time making a UI that shows off its abilities.
Jenny: I have never coded in javascript before, and although I look at tutorials, it is still very confusing. Whenever Ben gave me a problem to figure the function for, I had to research about it and then try to implement it to our code. I would have be able to help out the team more if I have known more about the language and understand the equation better.

                    Some of our greatest accomplishments are the graphic design of the website, the depth of the information provided, the ease-of-access to the refactored code that can be used in many ways to create practically any dynamic fractal.

                    Over the course of the creation of this project, we learned the extremes of amounts of stress and sleep deprivation that humans can withstand while still functioning properly. We also learned about the decentralized nature of fractals, the complex mathematics behind them, and their importance in ecosystems and industry.
                </p>

                    We hope to reuse most of the code from this project for more advanced future projects and potentially games.
