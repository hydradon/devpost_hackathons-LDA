                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this app to help ensure that resources were getting into the hands of people that truly needed them. Seeing organizations pump hundreds of thousands and even millions into the c-level executive's pockets and re-selling resources for a profit is something that pulled heavy at our hearts. While working in the environment of a hackathon time and resources are limited, we plan on continuing the growth of this project to help alleviate issues in our community, as well as ensure that when people who are better off going to help, that they actually help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where it matters is an application that allows users to find smaller local organizations that contribute a larger percentage of resources to the people that need them to donate to. Many large organizations give high salaries to many of their c-level executives that account for a large percentage of monetary donations. We hope to empower users to ensure that when they donate that they make it count.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application to call to an API of charities with the necessary data points to best inform our users.  However, we had challenges calling to the API due to technical difficulties responding to the GET actions.

                    Future Features
                </h3>
