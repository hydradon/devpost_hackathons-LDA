                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about how America has an obesity problem. Much of this could be attributed to the fact that we underestimate how much exercise we have to do to burn off how much we eat. If people knew it took, for example, an hour to walk off that donut, maybe they wouldn't eat donuts every other day.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters in the number of calories the user consumed or wishes to burn, along with the user's age, height, weight, and gender assigned at birth, and the program tells the user how many minutes of different activities the user can do to burn off those calories.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult using graphics in Java, especially creating text boxes that could accept user input, clickable buttons, and formatting everything. We are currently still unable to make all of the text line up nicely.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of coming up with an idea and executing it.

                <p>
                    Having a more aesthetically pleasing UI; expanding the program to determine something like how much food the user should eat, based on their physical traits and lifestyle.
