                    We are inspired by the rapid pace of innovation and the evolution of the workplace. With constantly evolving technology came new ways to work and learn such as working from home, collaborative online projects, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), and digital freelancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, freelancing has for the longest time been just a part of the gig economy that serves to generate a side income, and we feel that this is a wasted opportunity. It can be so much more. Driving from our personal experiences, in this competitive and highly skill-centric economy it is extremely tough for students to get meaningful work experience which, alongside being a source of income, also develops their professional careers and enhances their skills. Such opportunities are rare and hard to get currently, especially for students without relevant experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, our platform, ANT, will capitalize on the rise of the gig economy, and the increase in corporations hiring temporary labour, by connecting the two. We will offer students an opportunity to build their portfolios using meaningful real-world digital marketing projects and also give them offers and recommendations to improve their skillsets.

                    This website is built from scratch with the help of HTML, CSS3, Javascript by using the Bootstrap 4 Framework as the Front-end. While the Backend is supported by Django. The Hackathon Challenge for us is to incorporate Microsoft Azure as additional support to our Website that supposedly will help in cloud management and other SEO tools for this website.
