                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As cars become smarter, their built-in functions can integrate more and more AI-like features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The smart dashboard prompts the driver in the event of low gas to refill up by providing nearby/affordable gas stations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing GM's SDK, Google Maps API, and MyGasFeed, calculate the nearby/affordable gas stations based off real-time location data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding what the final idea was very time-consuming, as we jumped back and forth between ideas until we finally settled on the dashboard application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team and learning how to build an Angular application using a new SDK and other APIs in conjunction, particularly because our team was comprised primarily of first-time hackathon attendees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fuelr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After being able to locate gas stations and filter based off price/proximity, the application should provide a smart interface using TTS in order to engage with the user and determine whether or not to begin navigation towards the gas station. As a smart dashboard, other features, such as trip duration detection, can also be implemented in order to improve driver experiences.
