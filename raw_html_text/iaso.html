                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doctors without Borders is a truly amazing organization. There are also many other organizations like it. These groups risk their lives to travel to dangerous areas to provide help to struggling communities. We wanted to mitigate this risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Iaso is a platform that allows files of 3D scanned patients to reach doctors across the world. It exists on a mobile platform as volunteers are more likely to be able to use it on a mobile platform. Doctors that work with organizations will be able to communicate to the volunteers and review the models of patients, and provide a diagnose. Iaso effectively links areas of high risk to medical care they would otherwise not recieve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Photoshop to design all the assets and then implemented them in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not entirely familiar with Android Studio so it took a huge amount of time just to get situated. We also didn't have a 3D scanner on hand! So we learned about photogrammetry and created a temporary workaround for an otherwise project-ending roadblock. The tests we ran used lower detail model, and it went well. In the future, with higher quality equipment available, we'll be able to do a lot more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI is extremely friendly and easy to use. We found an incredibly cheap workaround for 3D scanners as well for testing, which we thought was very resourceful as otherwise we would have to switch our approach or abandon that idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D Scanning technology is truly a glimpse of the future, and even though our platform will be of great use for nonprofits in its next stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Iaso
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on getting more involved in 3D scanning and the associated technologies. We're going to experiment with automatic analysis of change between scanned models to detect anomalies such as melanoma extremely easily without a human opinion.
