                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to do something interesting featuring hardware
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sketches lines, in the future I intend to add support for svg files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A linear actuator from a printer was one axis, the other being made of 3d printed paper rollers to move the paper driven  by a continuous servo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    many challenges with 3d printing and getting the encoders working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It moves and draws
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino interrupts, 3d printing, cad, some circuits
                </p>
