                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to tackle a pressing issue in our city, thus we chose the unsafe streets for biking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our data would be used to help the government find ways to improve the commute system to accommodate bikers and it would be used ass an app for the public where people would be aware of dangers in their path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used tableau to collect our data. We used google slides to pitch our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have that much time to implement our idea which really took away much of our ideas potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea because we believe it could really make a difference in the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little more about how to compile data and to analyze it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BikeSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to implement it.
