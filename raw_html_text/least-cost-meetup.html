                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had numerous experiences where we wanted to meet up with friends in various group chats. It can sometimes be a laborious process finding out a centrally-located spot that meets our requirements and objectively considers the travel times of each participant. This idea spun from that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participants can provide their current or manual location and give meeting spot criteria (i.e. restaurant, coffee shop, pizza parlor, etc.) which filters a point of interest feature layer. A geoprocessing service identifies the times for participants to travel to each destination that meets the point of interest criteria, then presents these options in a list ordered by the least summed travel time for all participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is exposed in the form of a web app which can be visited via a URL. The user begins by either A) setting up a new meetup, or B) choosing to join an existing meetup. A "meetup" is comprised of the following: 1) a name, 2) a place type (to filter the POI layer), and 3) a list of users who are users to that meetup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a meetup is set up and entered, a map displays the locations of all users for that meetup as well as a single -returned POI feature whose travel time would allow everyone in the meetup to reach that destination in the least time possible.
                </p>
