                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recycling is very important as waste has a huge negative impact on our natural environment. A lot of people may not have adequate information on how they can recycle items around the house. So I decided to make a skill that could teach people how to recycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recycle Me is able to tell you how to recycle certain items. You can say, "Alexa ask recycle me how to recycle batteries." and it would tell you the steps needed. Recycle Me can also give facts about recycling which shed light on the severity of what waste that is not recycled is doing to our planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Alexa Developer Console to create the front-end and I used the sample fact project from Alexa to build the back-end on a Lambda function
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently trying to figure out how to use APIs with my lambda function. So that has been a challenge. Finding a good resource for information about recycling has also been a challenge. I would like to make the information vary according to the user's location so that it is more useful. I have also added Alexa Presentational Language to make visual experiences for Alexa-enabled screens though I would like to make the visuals more engaging and attractive
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am glad that it currently works and doesn't return errors. Getting to create an Alexa Skill has been a big achievement and I feel that this skill is something that can really help people recycle better.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learnt a lot about how to create an Alexa skill from this and I am still learning. I would like to learn more about creating lambda functions and APL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recycle Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to use an API to fetch data from and create a quiz about recycling. I also want to make suggest recycle centers near the user's location, adding better visuals and more items that a user might ask.
