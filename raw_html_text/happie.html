                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago we attended a talk by Neil Pasricha, the author of
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Happiness-Equation-Nothing-Anything-Everything/dp/0399169474" rel="nofollow">
                        The Happiness Equation.
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his talk, Neil outlined five activities that you could do everyday that would increase your happiness, and the science behind them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These things were:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Taking brisk nature walks. (they have to be brisk!, 3/week)
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Journalling
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Random Acts of Kindness
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Meditation
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Gratitudes (recognizing things that you are grateful for, 5/week)

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Happie is an iOS app to stay on top of these activities. It will send reminders, and keep a streak of your consistency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using swift. We decided to employ pair-programming enabling us to work closely together for the entire development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both of our first delves into iOS development as well as pair-programming! We were able to follow closely with many of Apple's tutorials to learn the steps we needed to make our idea a reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were only able to get to Hack Western late on Saturday, so we had a time crunch that we fought by working through the night. we are happy with the results.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Persevering through the night! Creating a functional app with no previous iOS experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The power of thorough reading!

                <p>
                    We're sending it to Neil (after a few revisions)! Hopefully it can serve as a tool for the people he talks to, enabling them to incorporate his lessons into their lives.
