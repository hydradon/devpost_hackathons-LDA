                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Catch is like PokemonGo for music. As consumers start spending more time using their device in the real world, apps like PokemonGo and other proximity-based media services are catching on like wildfire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Catch allows record labels or artists to place songs in the physical world using latitude and longitudes. As users come nearby, they are alerted of a song nearby. Using the heading reading from the BoseAR headset and the location from the user's phone, Catch allows a user to 'catch' a song by walking towards it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they movie toward the song it gets louder until they can finally catch the song and collect it.
