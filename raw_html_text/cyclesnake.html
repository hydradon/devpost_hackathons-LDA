                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just came to hack and have fun while learning new technologies (Sokect.io and Containers!!!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a multi-game mode snakes application that works in real-time and allows two people with an internet connection from around the world to play CycleSnakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS for the UI and Canvas. We used JavaScript to control our snakes and dynamically load the fruits and we used Socket.io to send data between two players in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A really complex problem we ran into was that when hooking up our express.js and node our socket.io connection was hooking up to the hidden server (bin -&gt; www) that was running instead of our main app.js server that was running. Finally, after 9 hours of self trying, 3 hours of a mentors assistance and one more mentor helping for 6 minutes we solved it and regained hope!
