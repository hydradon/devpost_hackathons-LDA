                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someone jokingly told Zach to incorporate a pinky into our project idea, and we rolled with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to find users who have similar goals and matches them with each other, who can hold each other accountable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native, Javascript, Expo, and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the framework/learning the framework took more time than expected.
Connecting the database with the app was very difficult given our use of Expo which proved to cause more problems than it solved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React Native, we created a logo, we didn't give up even though we were strongly considering it, we made a beautiful interface which could be a full-fledged app given more functionality, incorporated forms, sign in, and creation of a profile,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use React Native, Javascript, Google Cloud Platform, and Expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pinky Promise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would implement the functionality that we were planning, such as the matchmaking feature, implementing a database, and messaging among matches.
