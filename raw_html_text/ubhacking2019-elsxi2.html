                    Everyone's heard of RateMyProfessor, but no one ever thinks about the hardworking TAs that do their best to help the class run smoothly. Now, those TAs have the ability to see how they are viewed in the eyes of their class- whether or not that is a good thing will be determined by the class.

                    I've always been interested as a TA to hear what my students think of me. And students seem to love using RateMyProfessor as a tool, so why not make an equivalent tool?

                    I learned that reading and writing files are not the best way to go. It's incredibly painful and tedious, but unfortunately I didn't have time to set up MySQL or MongoDB.

                    I think that working by myself was a big roadblock to getting further along in the project. In addition to this, I had to leave for a few hours, which gave me even less time. However, I did enjoy being able to have the freedom to do what I wanted, which would have been more difficult in a group.
