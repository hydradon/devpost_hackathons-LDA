                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired to make UBC more inclusive. We have friends who are colour vision deficient and we wanted to make academic resources more accessible to them. We then wondered how technology can be used for this purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UncolouredPDF is a webapp where users can submit PDFs which have graphs or images that may not be very accessible for colour vision deficient people. We then return that PDF with updated colours which are easier to perceive for the users. We then extended it to PPTs and any JPG or PNG image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React for our front end to accept a PDF, PPT, JPG or PNG. We then convert it to a Numpy array and use a convolutional filter to change the colours. The algorithm we used is called Daltonization. We then convert it back to the original file format and the user is able to download the modified file. In addition, the users are also able to preview the modified file online after it has been processed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were new to React and had some trouble setting up the upload and preview features. We also spent some time supporting the various file formats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully implement the file upload feature to allow users to upload a PDF file and view the processed colour-blind-friendly file in the browser through a PDF viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React and Flask. We also learned about colour spaces and the need to make resources more accessible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UncolouredPDF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tool can be made to a Chrome extension for easy colour changes online. It can also be integrated to Google Drive on resources stored on the cloud.
