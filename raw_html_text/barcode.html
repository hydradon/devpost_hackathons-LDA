                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this system with a human-focus, so that guests do not have to take their credit cards out each time they try to purchase a drink, but also so that bartenders have an easier time tracking whose tabs are open or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generate a QR code to be printed on wristbands that guests wear until they wish to close their tab. The bartender has the capability to scan an individual's QR code and see their metrics but also metrics generated on aggregate to measure total social factors in the bar.
                </p>
