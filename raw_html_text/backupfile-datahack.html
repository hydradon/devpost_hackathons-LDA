                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was both Pandas and Jupyter Notebook themselves. Since this was our first time experimenting with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we tried to build our data set research inside of the provided BCycle.ipynb Jupyter Notebook itself. Though our approach and results were rudimentary, we were able to utilize the provided Pandas and Folium with the Jupyter Notebook to extract the data that we desired.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We compared the dates between different years of south by southwest period, and dates between differences of south by southwest period and end of south by southwest period.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We mainly used python to built this graph

                <p>
                    The bicycle usage during the special date and other date, and difference of usage in location by year and year.
