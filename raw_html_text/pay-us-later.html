                <p>
                    Team faced a lot of challenges, since the technology that we've used was not familiar at all to the team.
Team learned to use new technologies such as FFDC and GUI and VEU only during the short time of the Hackathon.
Team work and corporation was impressive, team joined forces for the hackathon mission and work was divided by all team members. Mohammad worked on the back-end, Chen worked on the front-end, Shira worked on the GUI, Boaz worked on the video and Gila worked to identify the APIs,  design and business/commercial aspects.
