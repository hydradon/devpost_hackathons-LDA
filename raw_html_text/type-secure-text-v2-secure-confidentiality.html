                    <strong>
                        Type Secure Text
                    </strong>
                    - I see a flaw with this activity in terms of Security and confidentiality. This allows the end user to see the password while typing in the actual control, if the control is non password/masked field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have created a activity to overcome this challenge with the help of UiPath. First it will identify the control type and then only it will type the password, otherwise it will not,

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this activity with the help of UiPath, Visual Studio, VB and C#.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I found challenge in adding the Indicate Control to my activity.

                <p>
                    I got a chance to improve the UiPath as its growing and i too. It gave me a new life.

                <p>
                    Overcoming the NetworkCredential(null, SecureString).Password - this should be avoided.
