                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by stories of car crash fatalities due to preventable human errors like fatigue and distraction, as well as the unrealized value of your phone mounted in the car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dashr identifies you and the road as you drive, to sense when you are fatigued and falling asleep, distracted and not paying attention to the road, going too fast and running a stop sign or red light, about to hit a car close to you, and alerting you to the issue via audio alerts and sounds. It runs completely in the background, being built for access and non-intrusiveness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built it over three days through development of machine learning functionality, constant ideation, and late nights with early mornings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized early on the core functionality we needed to develop for any general use of our app. As such, we worked on developing those but constantly ideated on the pitch; re-evaluating, re-assessing, and pivoting. We had to do that a number of times before we reached a final problem, final solution, and final business strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never stopped working, and never stopped thinking. We worked to maximize efficiency, dividing tasks to where they made sense, and constantly re-evaluating and getting the input of others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the value of efficient work, as well as taking advice from different people, but also how to filter for the right advice, rather than taking any that came our way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dashr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are interested in this idea, and are considering taking it to market.
