                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the merger of two real-world pain points: On the one hand, our fellow Egyptian teammate was eager to try healthy homemade specialty food and on the other hand, we wanted to get to know new people and make friendships in the city we recently moved into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With foodr, we connect people to cook together while sharing their stories, thoughts, culture, and laughs. As technology develops, we grow further apart, so we believe it is our duty to bring communities back together, just like the old times through gatherings of neighbors!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Technology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the development of our mobile app, we used Flutter,  Google's brand new cross-platform frontend framework. Flutter is directly integrated into the Google ecosystem, making it easy to develop in Android Studio while giving us full access to Google Cloud's incredible functionalities. Our choice for the database was Google Firestore, this incredible product offers the full power of traditional database systems with much more usability, efficiency in querying and extremely well-integrating with our stack. We used Firestore to store user information and the gathering events they create.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To collaborate effectively on the development process we actively used Github to track and organize our progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it is our first time using Flutter we ran into the obvious beginner problems. We had to read a lot of documentation and learn a lot about its architecture and how it works but in the end, it all perfectly worked out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud to have a stable working MVP. It was possible to accomplish almost every aspect we originally planned and we didn't have to cut back on any of the features. Moreover, we're extremely thrilled that our team was able to bond and work together without having nearly any internal conflicts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We definitely had fun in every second of the 24 hours development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Effective collaboration. We also were able to learn an entire new Framework that was only released recently, in just one day, and build an entire functioning app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to follow the idea through and continue to work on the project. Who knows? Maybe we'll even launch the product someday soon!
