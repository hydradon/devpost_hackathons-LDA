                    What it does: You play as Bernie Sanders in the year 2024. Barack Obama will be your mentor through this journey on fighting Donald Drumpf.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We mainly used RPG Maker VX ACE.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We started with using Unity and with a different type of game, but we realized it would take days for us to finish our project. So we switched into a more simpler RPG style game created with RPG Maker. RPG maker was hard to work with, for example, Obama sometimes would not speak, characters would loop commands from previous scenes and levels.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Actually finishing our project despite an extremely late start.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: To have a plan before coming to a hackaton to decrease chaos.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Feel the Bern: We can include more storyline and gameplay in between the three current levels for more satirical goodness.
