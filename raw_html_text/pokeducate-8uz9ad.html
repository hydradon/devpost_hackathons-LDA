                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a website for middle school and high school students to have fun and also to learn more about the basics of programming and Software Engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Pok&eacute;mon API and the player plays quizzes relates to programming and Software Engineering to evolve and upgrade his Pokemon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sublime-Text IDE to code in Javascript and to design and edit in html and CSS to create a website that uses Pok&eacute;mon API to accomplish our task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all working on different segments of the website and the most challenging part was to integrate them all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no practical experience in any web development programming languages but we worked together and made our own website within a day. We were very proud of our accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about web development programming languages and also ho to divide tasks among ourselves, work in groups in limited amount of time and produce results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pokeducate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for Pokeducate is more quizzes more Pok&eacute;mon and actually creating a journey of learning of software and programming concepts through an easier and fun approach that kids are fond of.
