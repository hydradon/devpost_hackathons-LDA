                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Question numero uno on the hacker's guide, which is incentivizing the private companies to pursue sustainable business practices. We felt that informing consumers of the impacts of their purchases is the most efficient way to accomplish this goal, as consumers tend to favor goods from manufacturers with good intentions. Consumers also would boycott companies that do not operate ethically or environmentally conscient, thereby encouraging companies to step up their act.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You first log into a react-native app, then scan a barcode. The barcode then gets sent to cloud firestore, where it is then displayed on the user's web page. There is also a snapchat log in option on the website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had 2 primary parts for this hack, the react-native app and the user webpage. We used Javascript and expo's firebase and barcode cv libraries for the app and we used firebase auth and the login kit from Snapkit for the frontend and cloud firestore for the backend of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into lots of problems in both the making of the react-native app and the frontend of the website. One react-native firebase toolkit was not stable, causing us to run into many problems until we resolved it via downgrading. The Snapkit API took us a while to get started as we found only limited documentation but we played around with the toolkit until we figured its capabilities.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being on time, seamless integration of the front and backends of our hack.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Important technical skills, especially in react-native framework and cloud firestore.
