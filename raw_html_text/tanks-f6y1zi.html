                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to tryout game Design with Unity and was planning on making something cool with teammate but decided later on to just start out small and learn how to even use Unity. This was mostly copy and pasting templates and learning how to use code and Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically features 1v1 tanks game with a couple of glitches with the movement and connecting the missile but it works for the most part
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A LOT of tutorials and downloading some assets online that assisted with most of the layouts and models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of code troubleshooting I had to do and the fact that not everything worked first time around
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually successfuly pulled it off and compiled a game that kind of works.
                </p>
                <h2>
