                <p>
                    We are a group that very thoroughly enjoys playing computer games. We got the idea for this game from sources of inspiration such as
                    <a href="https://www.factorio.com" rel="nofollow">
                        Factorio

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game! You can play it!
In this game, you build pipelines to deliver materials to the goal. Things can get quite complicated later on in the game!

                <p>
                    This game was all programmed in

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The road of game development is almost always a bumpy one. There were many bugs and glitches we ran into along the way.
The most frustrating mistakes were always caused by faulty merging using git. Our group lost many an hour and bore countless frustrated grimaces due to accidentally deleting work or duplicating code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a product. We are proud of being able to turn this rather complicated idea into a (at least partially) playable game. We are proud of being participants in this wonderful event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many  different things along the journey of this project. We  learned may specific details about how to use our tools more effectively - how to display sprites in Processing, how to play sound files, how to draw sprites, design a tutorial in a game, how to compose music, and any other things, as well.
                </p>

                    What's next for Yipes!!! Pipes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will probably leave Yipes!!! Pipes where it is after this hackathon. This was only meant to be a small project in the first place. We have no plans for the further development of this game.
