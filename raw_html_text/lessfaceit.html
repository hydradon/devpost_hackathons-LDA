                    A website created for HackRice that uses facial recognition software from Microsoft Azure to provide a doctor/patient login portal. We used Edge to run our website (some functionalities do not run on chrome).
                    <strong>
                        Less Face It
                    </strong>
                    is made to encourage doctors to put "less face" into "IT" and come to a reality; "let's face it" - they spend too much of their time on the technology that causes less interaction with their patient. Our website aims to increase doctor/patient interaction by doing all the technical stuff like logging in and identifying patient info using a Facial Recognition API by Microsoft. We implemented our current knowledge and learned along the way to create our final product!
