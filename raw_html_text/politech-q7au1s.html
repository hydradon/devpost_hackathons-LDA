                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a time when NYC voter turnout and registration has reached unprecedented lows. We aspired to create a solution to the issues that constantly plague citizens on election day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows citizens to leverage data about their local politician and community to influence change and stay informed on the issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using Android Studio and NYC Open Data. We also used Gliffy to build the UML and the Balsamiq to make the Wire Frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out what we needed to create first. Once we wrote down our ideas, things became simpler and we thought about what we actually needed to solve the specific problem of voter awareness in NYC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together as a team. Challenging ourselves to learn new languages and create something that can really help out the community in a tangible way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make API calls using Android Studio and parsing data in JSON array thanks to our friends at CUNY!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PoliTech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding our team to bring this vision to life! Ideally, we want to start signing people up to register to vote on our app and getting some test data to further improve the MVP.
