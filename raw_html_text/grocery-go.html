                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Living in a household of 10, feeding that many people over the course of a week was hard to do without buying food that would end up going to waste, or not buying enough to last the whole week. This app provides a quick and easy way for heads of large households, hermits who live at their desks, or a young couple living on their own for the first time to buy the right amount of food and cut down on waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulls together household size and budget from the user, along with nutritional information and data from the Wegmans API in order to build the optimal shopping cart for any size group be it a newlywed couple or a family of ten.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One's cart is also compatible with your Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself was built in Android Studio to be compatible with Android devices running Oreo and above. After configuring a database of recipes and store locations, we applied them to configure shopping carts based on whatever dietary preferences the user selects. The XML-based UI was built alongside the classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a custom web service with google cloud app engine to keep track of recipes across multiple devices, allowing an Alexa interface.
                </p>
