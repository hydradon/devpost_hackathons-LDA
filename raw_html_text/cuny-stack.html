                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration comes from great professors coming and going from the CUNY schools. Understandably, universities have more funds than CUNY schools. So, it would be great to have a archive of all courses and materials. In addition, a search function similar to Quora or Stackoverflow would improve our student's study routine. Simply googling would give you answers and resources outside the scope of our courses.

                    Admins benefit by seeing fresh content from professors. This is a partial solution to cheating. By having professors use new content(exams quizzes) every semester, students are always on a similar playing field. 
New professors benefit by being able to look at pass content to construct their curriculums as a pose to from scratch.
Students should get extra credit for maintain the site with good questions/answers and additional resources.
