                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe the age of dApps is here. We built this ecosystem to allow developers to raise funds directly from Investors and get feedback on the dApp developed. This platform allows developers and founders to grow their credibility. By submitting their project on the immutable blockchain, investors can do an assessment on the delivery as it is described in the whitepaper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a common platform for dApp developers to publish and promote the cool new prototyes, MVPs and alpha version of their dApps. Early birds eager to use dApps can find latest projects here and get opportunities to earn 'airdrops'. Plus, investors can pitch in with their funds on projects they are excited about. All this on the blockchain in a decentralized manner. Plus, projects submitted on the platform can also serve as proof of ownership of the dApp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a smart-contract in Solidity that we deployed on the Ethereum Rospten testnet. Via this smart-contract dApp developers can publish their dApp's development and funding status on our dAppMap. We use a script that constantly synchronizes the website's local database with the Ethereum blockchain via an API by Infura (

                        https://infura.io/
                    </a>
                    ). The website is written in Python using Django with Bootstrap on the front-end.

                    Code from before the Hackathon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The file
                    <code>
                        event_watcher.py
                    </code>
                    was based on code written before the start of the hackathon. This file synchronizes the data from the Ethereum blochchain with the web application's database.

                        We lacked skills to use the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, so we resorted to building upon Ethereum.

                    <li>
                        It was a real challenge to recruit and convince developers to work on the project.
