                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know of many people who often feel depressed, and they just want someone to talk to. I wanted to make an assistant to help provide just something to make you talk, just to get your feelings out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It Tries to get you to talk in depth about your feelings, until you start to realize why you feel the way that you do, and can help you feel better. It also tries to match your emotions to act more sympathetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry pi and connected it to the google assistant api, as well as the cloud speech and dialogflow api's.
The case was 3d printed and servos were mounted to simulate expression
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program came out more sarcastic at first, making you feel worse than when you started. Also starting up the device still requires a monitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The case looks adorable, and we sucseefully connected it to the cloud speech API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware hacking takes a ton of time just for the modeling and construction.

                <p>
