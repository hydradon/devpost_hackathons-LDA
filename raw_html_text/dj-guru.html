                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you look at applications, be them for PC, Mac, Android or iOS, you'll find innovation around playing with a DJ kit, but there is a lack of innovation around teaching people the foundation on how to use these tools and learn the concepts that a DJ needs. We want to take on that challenge and build a learning platform for how to learn how to DJ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a platform on which to learn how to become a DJ. With an progressive learning plan and availability of both in-house lessons and community contributions you will have a simple track to DJ greatness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web platform is written on the Angular.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ensuring an engaging user experience that makes learning fun and encourages frequent visits. Learning is infinitely more effective with frequent use (frequency being ideally daily visits to the site) and so we wanted to capture the right parts of enjoyment with the right level of challenge that keeps the experience satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Validation from people excited to learn and utilize the platform. Music is such an important part of my life and I'm so proud to help bring more music to people's lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next step is a public alpha to be announced in the upcoming months.
