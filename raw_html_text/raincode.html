                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use existing data/relationships in code to create art for the Art &amp; Technology category of the hackathon.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone can use the service (soonTM) by visiting our (currently private) website, uploading some C source-code an generating art! While creating these pictures, we aimed draw inspiration from the "Brainbow" while staying somewhat true to the nature of the source files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project is built in Java and HTML/PHP. Code analysis and art-generation happens in our Java application, while user interaction happens through a web frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we met during this project were distributed over a wide array of topics. We have had to fight with interpolation, the parsing of C files, and last but not least web-development, as we were very unexperienced in creating web services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Team communication was great! We quickly decided on a project we want to complete and have been on schedule from that point on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating art that looks good while being based on source code, is NOT easy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BainCode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this app, so that we can easily expand it to more languages later on. Playing around with settings for for creating good looking Brainbows is fairly easy and allows for a lots of tinkering with the code.
