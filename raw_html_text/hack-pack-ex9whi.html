                    Our team was interested in encouraging reuse of packaging materials for various ecommerce uses. We focused on Meal Kit Subscription services, and Grocery Delivery services as they seemed to produce the most packaging waste, and had the highest potential for reuse.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our solution provides a reusable, foldable, mailable, recyclable outer pack which allows the Meal Kit Subscription provider to recover the outer pack for reuse.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Inspired by collapsible products, and rigid air filled packs, our designers set about designing a foldable pack that meets USPS standards for drop box compliance.

                <h2>
                    There needs to be a strong financial incentive for companies to participate, and it needs to solve two main customer needs - Low effort to recycle/reuse, less need for storage of packing materials.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hack Pack? - We're looking to partner with a Meal Kit Subscription startup to run a pilot program with our Hack Pack prototype to gather better #'s, and refine logistics.
