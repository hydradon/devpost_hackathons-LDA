                <p>
                    The modern music industry is awful, it is extremely competitive and unfair. For example, more than 90% of musicians are

                    , and moreover, artists get only 12% of the money the

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides, technology has significantly changed the music business. As a result, the ballooning increase of convenience for consumers has rapidly become a bust for musicians trying to make a living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Bette Midler has written some popular music. She

                    that she made $114.11 on 4,175,149 plays of her work.

                    Problem #2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The YouTube and gaming industries are similar to the music industry, but in addition to the same problems, they also have a problem with finding music. All videos and games must have music, but most novice YouTubers and game developers cannot buy it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decentralized networks allow for the creation of free platforms for distributing content, and cryptocurrencies allow for the creation of fee-free payments for artists. BentenSound uses both technologies and both problems to solve them both &mdash; on the one hand, YouTubers and game developers can use absolutely free music for their videos/games, on the other hand, musicians will gain promotions and donations without fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a video of a young YouTuber that used a free song can go viral, and as a result, they can share the popularity with the musician. Or a young game developer that did not have money while developing their first games can become successful, and as a result, express gratitude to a musician and share their revenue.

                <p>
                    Right now my main goal is to engage as many new musicians as possible. But in addition, I am working on improving the overall UX: add filtering by genres/moods/themes and optimize work with blockstack (I have plans to add backend-proxy to speed up downloading of tracks).

                <p>
                    In the future, I have plans to increase potential revenue for musicians: First, I want to add the possibility to create and sell merchandise (like t-shirts, mugs, etc.), and then I want to add partnerships with
