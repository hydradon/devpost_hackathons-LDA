                    This project was put together for the Challenge Post Summer Jam 2015 challenge. After deciding to participate in the challenge and peruse the available datasets, one of the first sets I noticed was the Farmers Market location data. In the Research Triangle
  Region of North Carolina, where I live, we are blessed many farmer's markets in and around the Raleigh-Durham Area.

                    Knowing that many of the publicly available data sets from the government are focused on poverty and income equality, I deciced to explore the connection between the farmers markets and public transporation. More specifically, does the Go Triangle transit
  system service enable low income inhabitants to visit and purchase fresh, locally made, and healthy food options?
