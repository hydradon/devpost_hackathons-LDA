                    Every day, 2,500 US youth abuse a prescription pain reliever for the first time, 15 million people in the US - of which 4.4 million are aged 12 through 17 - abuse prescription drugs daily, and about 38% of overdose-related deaths result from misuse of pills. Quite obviously, there's a problem. Granted nearly everyone has heard about this issue, but not too many truly realize how sheerly widespread it is. In order to work towards the betterment of domestic welfare (particular within youth), we've created the MedSafe: a coded pill bottle meant to prevent misuse of prescription drugs. In order to open the bottle, you first need to fall within a certain time period. The MedSafe allows for flexibility regarding whatever chronological interval your medication needs to be taken. Since the last time it is opened, the bottle sets a timer until the next time it can be opened. For example, if you're supposed to take your medication every 8 hours, the bottle won't allow you to open it until 8 hours from the last time the cap was undone. In order to open the bottle itself, you input a custom color-based code of virtually unlimited length. The bottle would be operated by a figure of authority (e.g. a parent, guardian, nurse, etc.). Overall, this device will hopefully discourage any intent to take advantage of prescription drugs, prevent those with previous abuse history from continuing to do so, and ultimately, increase the well-being of our society.
