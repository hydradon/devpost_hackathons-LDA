                    PeriodBot is a chatbot that can conduct recurring orders automatically.
It includes a calendar where you can mark when orders should be shipped and can connect to your Amazon account to find popular products that may appeal to your likes or shopping patterns.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built PeriodBot using Javascript, Gupshup, IBM Watson, and the Amazon API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of our team had previously worked with IBM Watson or the Amazon API, we struggled to make it functional in the chatbot.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chatbot is fully functional(short of actually placing orders) and uses sentiment analysis to communicate in a conversational approach. We were also able to complete this hack in the designated time period and worked well as a team.
