                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main reason that inspired this idea was the constant food waste experienced at the FIU campus by us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a station that takes a picture of people's leftover food to be shared on social media and later picked up by hungry students/faculty staff for free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Qualcomm dragonfire microcontroller to control the webcam and do the automatic Instagram posting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automating the instagram posting, using a new microcontroller, and make a stand for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a meaningful project and being able to fully implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most micro-controllers operate very similarly. Used python for the first time.
                </p>

                    What's next for FoodForAll
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use machine learning to classify food and send emojis accordingly.
