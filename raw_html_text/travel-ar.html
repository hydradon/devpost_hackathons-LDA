                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend Damia, recently went on a trip around the world. She started in Australia and went around China, Nepal, India, South Korea, Indonesia and few other countries.

She learned about people's struggles, experienced life with the locals and learned about their culture. Seeing her Facebook posts inspired me. I was pumped to do the same!

The only problem was that all I had was 100 bucks in my bank account and an iPhone.
That&rsquo;s why I decided to build an app which would let me travel in AR.

You can download it here -

                        You can turn the globe with your fingers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is an ARKit app, so you can walk around the globe.

                        There are multiple videos to watch for any given region.

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and ARKit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ARKit is pretty new and there aren't as many resources to develop for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tested it on over 50 people to make sure that the user experience was intuitive. I use my app daily while having dinner to travel the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UX is very important. Initially people had difficulties in using the app but by making minor adjustments, I was able to remove any confusion users might have with the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Travel AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal is to sell the app to Expedia, Airbnb or some major company and use that money to actually travel the world.
