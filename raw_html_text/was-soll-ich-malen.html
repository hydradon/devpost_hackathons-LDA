                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have two children. When they get bored, they always ask me what to paint. Most of the time I was surprised by their spontaneous request. So I thought to myself, collect a few painting suggestions and let the children just ask Alexa what they should paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the kids ask alexa, what do you want me to paint? Does Alexa greet the children according to the time of day and shows them a random painting suggestion? If a child does not know what to paint, it can also say gallery (Galerie) and an overview of pictures is displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use node.js and APL as the programming language for the design. The code and the bid files are hosted in the AWS cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this skill I worked with APl for the first time. First of all I had to think myself back into the material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What do you want me to say? Well, I'm a little proud that I managed to put the skill into practice with APl.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned that even small things please my children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Was soll ich malen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought I'd replace the many pictures that the skill knows with pictures of children using the skill. So the kids can inspire each other with Alexa. I don't know exactly how to do that yet. Because there are also special rules for kid skills. At the moment, children get a discreet hint when they ask for a motif that doesn't yet exist that their parents could send a picture to my e-mail address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, with the help of my daughter (9), I think about including small malt tutorials. She can draw relatively well. But this also takes time, because your school education is of course much more important.
