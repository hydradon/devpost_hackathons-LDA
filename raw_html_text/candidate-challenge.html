                        Keep first mocks very low-fi - we drastically had to do last minute changes to 2 screens after testing yet spent so much time with details like adding checkboxes/fields etc.

                        Refining the problem statement. We initially wanted to address both optimizing job search and feedback challenges of the hackathon, but focused on the latter due to the OBVIOUS lack of feedback feature in job search websites.

                <p>
                    Successful team alignment  -  We all took turns in sketching, prototyping, testing, iterating (everyone's sketch app/google slides were up in case one of us has to run out and test and/or synthesize key findings and plop on the deck.) This contributed greatly to arriving at decisions on the product roadmap, and feature prioritization.
