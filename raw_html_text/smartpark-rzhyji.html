                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a social cause for the general public. Spending hours searching for a vacant parking spot is simply a waste of time. It inspired us to work towards this project and do something for the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the person find a vacant parking spot in a parking garage, or somewhere in the huge parking lot. It helps to save a lot of time for the person to find a vacant parking spot and navigate him/her directly to that particular spot.
