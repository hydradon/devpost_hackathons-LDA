                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lost our friends way too many times while skiing, snowmobiling, snowboarding, and hiking. After experiencing this and hearing about numerous groups getting lost in the backcountry we decided to make a heads-up display to aleviate these trials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a compass and GPS to give a real-time augmented layover to show your possition relative to other recreationalists with the BuddyFinder and relative to your starting point or waypoint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of soldering and fighting with GPS and I2C libraries. We created our own addressable LED strip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GPSD stopped working half way into our project for seemingly no reason. We also had a lot of trouble with I2C libraries for our compass
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The form factor of our prototype is satisfying along with the functionality of the LEDs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt lots about soldering and using I2C
                </p>

                    What's next for BuddyFinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a cheaper and possibly simpler implementation
                </p>
