                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create a project that we felt excited to make an impact within this modern day and age
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through the programming languages of Java, HTML, and the programming software of Sublime Text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned team-building tactics, by incorporating our wide range of skill sets, knowledge, and experiences by creating an application which fosters innovation and change.
                </p>
