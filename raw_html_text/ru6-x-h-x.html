                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, we received free Rubik's cubes from eBay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to take a picture of all sides of your Rubik's cube. It then sends it to a backend that solves the cube for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jay implemented a rudimentary client-side image processing algorithm that&rsquo;s showing 80%-90% accuracy for identifying each cube face&rsquo;s colors in ideal conditions. And all in Swift!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ismail used Haskell and Scotty to build out the backend. The solver uses a naive brute force algorithm to "solve" the cube.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jay - The algorithm is at 80%-90% accuracy but this can be improved with time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ismail - The algorithm is brute force so it will only actually be able to solve the last two steps of a cube. Change to this algorithm will be made in the future when there is more time.
                </p>
