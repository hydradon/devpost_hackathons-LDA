                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part funny prank, part useful tool. I ran across the http.cat website and I wanted something that would easily show you http codes in a fun, clever way within our Slack team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monitors Slack messages for anything that looks like and HTTP status code. It then replies with the image URL from the http.cat website which will be inlined by Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was originally built using Spark as a microservice running on Heroku (easily extensible to any other similar platform). I adapted it to run on AWS Lambda, which was a very simple exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a very simple service, there were not too many challenges. Adding the AWS API Endpoint was a little tricky, but I figured that out by following the examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were some challenges writing the parser as it had to handle things like numbers over 1000 with commas (e.g., " I raised $300,404" shouldn't get a response, while "Got an http 502, and crashed the app" should). For these things I wrote tests with JUnit to ensure the parser worked as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how simple it is to build microservices. I went through the whole process of configuring a Maven build, with JUnit tests executing on every build and automated deployment when pushing to GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for slackcat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to have the ability to search for an unknown code. For sample, using a slash command in Slack, you could do something like "/slackcat not found" and it would reply with "
                    <a href="http://http.cat/404" rel="nofollow">
