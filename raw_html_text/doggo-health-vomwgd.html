                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dogs don't have the same amount of healthcare as much as humans, even though the available data is almost as much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives the dog owner a full-suite of products to take care of their dogs health by providing them with all their healthcare data, giving access to book appointments, find other dogs in the area, and most importantly, predict a potential high-healthcare risk of the dog and notify you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it over the last couple of days by building on top of the Whisper and kinship APIs by creating an Android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The factors for the heart attacks for dogs needed a lot of research in terms of understanding what kind of framework we need to create to do the emergency response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built out a fully functioning product that takes care of the health of the dog in under 48 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pet care tech is not explored at all as an industry -- and we can take this forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Doggo Health
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating partnerships with Kinship to help implement this ontop of their product.
