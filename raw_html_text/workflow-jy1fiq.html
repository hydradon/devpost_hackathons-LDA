                <p>
                    Life is full of complex and entangled "workflows". We wanted to bring a change into the monotonous chores that people perform on a daily basis and effectively automate these tasks with ease.

                        WorkFlow
                    </strong>
                    performs activities as depicted in a hand-drawn flowchart by the user. It lets the user write the tasks that he desires to perform in the form of a flowchart and scan it in front of his/her computer camera. Based on the flowchart symbols used in the diagram,

                        WorkFlow

                    identifies the desired tasks and commands the system to perform them in order. From opening a webpage, listening to songs on YouTube to sending emails to recipients and updating your Task list,

                    We modularized our approach in building

                    and both of us started off with the component modules of the application. Initially, we used OpenCV3 alongside Python to detect the image boundaries in the flowchart diagram captured by the camera. Due to the inability of morphological processing to effectively identify the boundaries, we used the Google Vision API to detect object boundaries and the text within. Based on this data, we processed the text and classified it to perform the desired action. We also used the Google Gmail API for the Authentication and integrated it with
