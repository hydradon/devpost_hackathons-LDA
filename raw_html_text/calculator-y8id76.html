                    Progressive web apps allow users to cache parts of the application at their first visit so that they can access them and utilize them offline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used as many learning resources as we could (blogs, videos, documentation) to learn how to create the applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges: Hosting was difficult at first, as well as learning how to get the Javascript to communicate with an API that we previously were inexperienced with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design, functionality, as well as uniqueness in that it not only helps users by computing their problem, but it also gives them a random fun fact about the outcome!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next? Further utilize service worker capability to cache majority of site.
