                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first grouped up, we were talking about simple apps/games that went viral. Cookie clicker was one of those apps, and one of us came up with the idea to do the same thing, but with a cowbell.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You press the space-bar a lot and buy stuff.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built with the Unity engine which uses C# for all of its coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us on the team knew anything about C# or Unity, so we had to teach ourselves literally overnight throughout the creation of this using Youtube and Unity's website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud that we taught ourselves C# and Unity for this. We are also very proud we got the "+1 hype" text to appear correctly. We believe it was the hardest part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better cooperate as a team, and we strengthened our programming skills dramatically as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Android support and a few more features we didn't have time for today.
