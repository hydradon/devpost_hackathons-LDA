                </h2>
                <p>
                    EHR (Electronic Health Records) Need in India: The current status of the healthcare sector in India is associated with low public spending (1% of GDP), high out of pocket payments (71%), a high level of anemia among young women (56%), high infant mortality (47/1,000 live births), high maternal mortality (212/100,000 live births).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This highlights the need for major reforms in the healthcare sector. Though information and communication technology (ICT) cannot work as a panacea, it can provide a cost-effective solution to improve the quality and coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indian doctors are in the process of adopting electric health/medical records maintenance online. It not only gives complete information about the patient, about his previous medical history, and also saves time while providing treatment, as going through the medical record doctor can get in to fast conclusion on what treatment to provide immediately. Indian government is taking consideration into maintenance of health records online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proliferation of mobile phones and the availability of high-speed Internet offer the possibilities to provide healthcare services in rural, remote areas of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UIPath Automation Suite brings in a variety of tools that when integrated with EHR platform can enable the effective delivery of quality healthcare at speed and help reduce the maintenance costs of record keeping, enable better care coordination.

                    We wish to mention that integrating and sending medical reports using NuCypher protocol required lot of mentorship from Bogdan Opanchuk and Dr. Michael from NuCypher. They helped us at every step of implementing NuCypher whether it was installing the correct versions of requisite libraries and tools and helping us running the re-encryption protocol. We wish to thank the EthIndia community and fellow participant hackers, who helped us learn and implement our idea in a fine way.
We also spend a number of hours trying to learn effective ways of utilizing UIPath Tools, Python Snippets with EHRS platform to enable improved care coordination, cost effective maintenance of records and faster process management for cost effective healthcare delivery. We found the Edureka tutorial (
