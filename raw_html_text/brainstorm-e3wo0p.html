                    Brainstorm is the premiere tool for mind-mapping and collaborative creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal for Brainstorm is to have a dynamic online environment for collaborators to share ideas in a cohesive and organized way. The structure of a Brainstorm consists of nodes and connections between those nodes, to demonstrate how different ideas and goals connect together. The contents of each node can be edited to hold any rich text, including images and code snippets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current implementation of Brainstorm does not include an online collaborative functionality. It is fully client-side and the user can add and delete nodes as they please. In the final version, users would have accounts and would only be able to delete their own nodes. They would also be able to save multiple projects and revisit them as desired, and invite others to collaborate on their projects.
