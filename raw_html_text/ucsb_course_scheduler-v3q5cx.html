                <p>
                    As a college students, we have the recurring problem of wasting time defining our schedules at the beginning of every quarter or semester. Most students want to minimize break times between classes to enjoy their free time, extracurricular activities and organize extended study periods.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user lands on the home page and searches for the classes required for the semester or quarter. Then he will select classes that he must complete in the current quarter and elective ones that he wants to take. By clicking on the organize bottom, the page will lead the user to a scheduling dashboard showing required and elective classes sorted by the least amount of break time during a day for a week. The user can block time for extracurricular activities in the "Extra Activities" section. The user can then drag the bottom to indicate the time where it wants the schedule to minimize for break times during the week based on the extracurricular activities, required and elective courses. Once the user sees the desired schedule, he or she can select it and a print-out version will be available.

                    Front was created using Angular 7, TypeScript and the Material UI framework.

                    We ran into the blocker of creating a dynamic search feature for searching courses.

                    Course scheduling is a pain at UCSB. You need to make a list of courses and constantly check and parse different department pages without being able to see how potential sections fit together.

                <p>
                    Our project pulls data on all courses from UCSB for the winter 2019 quarter. It then uses convex optimization to try and narrow the possible space of all potential schedules. We then found an iterative solution to ensure we could implement all combinations (leave no stone unturned).

                    One of the team member&rsquo;s went out of his comfort zone in terms of learning a new frontend framework. Learning from students from different schools and academic backgrounds.
The time efficiency in our timing validation.
Effective use of pandas to break down course schedules.
A mathematical formulation that can allow expansion of this idea to large datasets.

                    I learnt that asking for help earlier on the hackathon would have yielded better results in terms of troubleshooting errors.
