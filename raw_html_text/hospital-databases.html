                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with the challenge of Best Hack for Aiding Natural Disaster Recovery Efforts by Booz Allen Hamilton. We decided that one of the most important aspects of recovery efforts is being able to provide proper care for the wounded and dying. Often a lack of resources prevents hospitals from properly performing their job. To help fix this issue we wanted to create a database only accessible by hospitals. They would use this database to update their own inventory and view the inventory of nearby hospitals. This would allow them to find the resources that they need and request them from one of the hospitals in the database rather than placing an order with their provider and waiting for a shipment. The goal is that this database could help save lives of those affected specifically by natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database allows hospitals to update their inventory and look at/ search other hospitals inventories. This helps them find supplies in emergency situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use MongoDB to host our database. This decision was made because we knew that we would be able to access professionals that work on this database while at bitcamp and work out any difficulties we encountered. We also liked how it is user friendly and updates in real time. It also works well with HTML so that we were able to design the site the database was hosted on to look how we wanted. We coded most of the project in javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with MongoDB. It had been a while since any of us had coded in HTML or Javascript. We had difficulty organizing the project. MongoDB is hosted online and wifi was a little unreliable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real-time updating of the database. Interactions between HTML and Javascript. Ability to build a working database that catches errors in input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with MongoDB. Learned more about the functionality of databases. Refreshed Javascript and HTML skills.

                    What's next for Hospital Databases
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add supplies by ID only
Email other hospitals through SES on the database
Both personalized and mass
White-list IPs for security
Verify that a username is available
Verify that the ID and item name match
Remove user option
