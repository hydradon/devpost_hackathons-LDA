                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all go to the doctors for fever, flu and any other sickness that you might have gotten. But can you honestly say that you taken the prescribed medicine on time ? Are you really helping yourself by skipping the pills ?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea hopes to be the start to a revolution where QR codes will be printed on the front of medicines for those who are taking to scan as they are taking them to let the doctor know that they're taking them. If they forget to take their medicine, they'll get a gentle reminder to do so.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a whole variety of tech stack to build this idea to make sure its available on all platforms.

                <p>
                    There were plenty of challenges, one of it being, hosting the python script on the cloud.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud by the very fact that this proof of concept is workable and we've gone around asking if people think that this is a problem worth solving. As expected, 79% of the interviewee thought that it was !!

                <p>
                    We've learnt that a dynamic team allows a project to be accomplished in less than 24 hours.

                <p>
                    We've discussed and think that approaching healthcare, and especially private clinics to pitch this idea and see what the mass market thinks.
