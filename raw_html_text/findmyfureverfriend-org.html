                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were discussing some ideas for awhile and had not come up with much. Suddenly I thought about a local animal shelter I volunteer weekly at near IUP. I knew some of the board members, so it was not too difficult to get permission to use info from their Facebook page. We all agreed this project would be the most doable for our skill level (the four of us are all freshmen).

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web page shows information about various dogs and provides users with the option to fill out one of two forms: a form to adopt the dog and a form to schedule a visit.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website uses objects stored in a bucket in the Google Cloud project we created. The objects consist of pictures of dogs and short descriptions of the dogs as well as the main html file. When grouped together in html format, they form the source code for our domain:

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally planned to use Google Cloud's Vision API to process photos of dogs and determine breeds. However, none of us were able to understand the tutorials with our current skill set and decided that we would not have enough time. Buckets were also somewhat difficult to understand at first, but we were able to get the hang of them.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As freshmen, we are glad that we were able to submit a working project for our first ever Hackathon. I personally am proud of myself for learning html within the brief time period (I know it is a relatively simple language, but I personally have not done any web development manually before today).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can all agree that the main thing we learned was how much we did not know and how much there is out there to learn. Two of us talked with one of the representatives of Google about preparing for internships, and now we have a good idea of the path we should take in the near future to stay ahead of the curve. We all learned a good amount about the Google Cloud platform, and some of us talked about using it again for next Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for findmyfureverfriend.org
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the owner of the page, I may mess around more with the html and Google Cloud and see if I can make something better that the organization can actually use efficiently in the future. My other teammates said they will do more research to better prepare for the next Hackathon at which we may have a similar, yet unique concept.
