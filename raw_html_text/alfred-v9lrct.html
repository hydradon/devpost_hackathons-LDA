                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping in mind that how busy our lives are getting now-a-days time management has become one of the most important aspects of almost everybody. Wouldn't it be great to have someone who can help you do that? Something like this can help you have sufficient free time and even maintain a great social and work life balance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alfred is a smart time management service, which enables the user to have a very own personal assistant which can schedule meetings, suggests free time that can be utilized, enable other people to book meetings with you and can do much more potentially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried maximizing the potential of twilio by setting up a virtual assistant on a phone number. The twilio phone number can then be used as a personal assistant which can allow other people to book meetings with the user, if the person's meeting request clashes with the user's other commitments, then it suggests the person with optimal alternatives. It uses Google Calendar's API to get the user's schedule, create event, and delete event. We have used wit.ai to add NLP into the assistant as well, which makes the conversation a lot more human friendly. The whole backend of our project is written in python and the database is a mongoDb.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some problems implementing the different APIs but we were able to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully added a smart virtual assistant over a phone number, which doesn't even need any mobile application to be used. All you need is a phone number to interact with the Assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the potential of AI in the workplace and how it could possibly be a major part of everyone's life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alfred
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is the possibility of implementing more functionality to the AI. It could be used to schedule different kinds of events and optimize the schedule of a specific person.
