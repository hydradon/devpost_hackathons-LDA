                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of crime data out there, and its hard for police officers to make sense out of it, simply by looking at an excel sheet. With proper visualizations they could get the jump on potential risks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes CSV crime data and loads it into a database. A web based front end then makes calls to the database and visualizes the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with a Django backend server and a Javascript/HTML/CSS front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the database to properly serve the desired informations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a few decent visualizations working well and the backend database is rather robust. Given more time we could have created a lot more visualizations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the difficulties of analyzing large data sets and the different challenges that come with trying to organize that data into a database.
                </p>

                    What's next for WhoShotWhom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could expand what we have from this hackathon and bring it to other hackathons to make it a more robust, coherent analytical tool
