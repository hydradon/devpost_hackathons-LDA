                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of Augmented Reality is huge. Pokemon go was released a few months and cerated a huge spike in interest in Augmented Reality. The original idea was to find your parked car using AR, but I felt like I should challenge myself and built a restaurant/cafe finder!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept in general goes a long way. Image a student who can't find their class on the first day of school. Simply open the phone and look around. The same goes for parking, finding stores in a mall, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open the app to find restaurants near you. Hitting the Googles button will open a camera, displaying info about each building you see and your environment around you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using Android mainly because I've been doing a ton of Node and iOS lately. I used a camera vision library to apply Augmented Reality and connected to the Google Places api to get the points of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality was a huge pain, but a great payoff. I spend over 4 hours finding the right resources and libraries need, also learning about the concept in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did something with camera vision. I had time to play with things like fake detection and 3d mapping, so I will definitely research more of this in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't done an Android in while so it was fun to get back into it. I learned at ton this hackathon, things like Augmented Reality and Retrofit (An http library, i'm used to Volley).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dinAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think dinAR is a great concept, and I would love to make a much better algorithm for the Augmented Reality. The current  library has a poor use of matrix projections and accelerometer uses. I would love for it to be as nice as Pokemon Go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of that, this would be a general
