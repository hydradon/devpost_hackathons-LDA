                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to attempt a hardware and software challenge. The idea for the project was something that was useful and also convenient. Bike locks are useful to secure your bicycle but we felt there was an easier way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple bike lock but it connects with bluetooth to a phone app. Once the user is close enough, the button can be pressed to disarm and arm the lock
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a servo motor to rotate the lock into place. We used a raspberry pi to communicate between the servo, button and bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had size constraints on the 3D printing. We had hardware failures and had to adjust the servo to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plan ahead for solid works and budget time beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bluetooth Bike Lock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is much to be improved and acted upon in the original plan. We can implement 3D printing for design aesthetics and also include more complex passwords for the app.
