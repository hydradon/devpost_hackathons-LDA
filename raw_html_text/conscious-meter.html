                    Our inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by the theme of Hack Davis to create a project targeted for social good. Utilizing the high resolution real time data provided by OSIsoft on the energy consumption of this campus, we came up with the idea of
                    <strong>
                        Conscious
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conscious is our web application that analyzes WiFi and electricity consumption data and creates a report of energy usage per hour for individual users present in a building. Our aim is to interpret user relevant information from the high resolution facility level data that's being generated in real time. 
/?using the data collected reaching it to the single user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built
                    <strong>
                        Conscious
                    </strong>
                    on a python and matplotlib infrastructure. We communicate and analyze the time series data from OSIsoft web IDs. This communication includes locating the exact location of useful data and normalizing the data. We found the time stamp and value for each energy consumption of each building the most useful for our purposes from OSIsoft data sets.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the early stages of development, we faced a challenge with Grafana post method implementation. We decided to take a step back and use python in order to move forward with the project and meet the hackathon's time limit.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of
                    <strong>
                        Conscious
                    </strong>
                    because it accomplishes the task of reaching out to the users with the information that inspires a better practice for lowering energy footprints. Analyzing large data sets such as the ones provided by OSIsoft is an overwhelming task, however we learned how to take a specific feature from this batch of data and put it to use.

     - Integrating the percentage of renewable and non-renewable energy used during the user's stay at a facility
     - Adding a waste generated by user API 
     - Improving data set prediction accuracy by eliminating false readings
