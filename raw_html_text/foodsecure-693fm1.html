                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Having conducted research in lower income, minority communities, it's been made clear to me how much of a problem food insecurity can be. The USDA describes the problem as twofold. Not only are over 40 million Americans unable to get access to a grocery store, but even if they had access they would be unable to afford it. As a result, these Americans often resort to other, less regulated ways to get their produce such as through fruit stands and farmers' markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, farmers face their own set of problems. Farmers find themselves at the mercy of ever-changing consumer demands and the majority rely heavily on farming subsidies to stay afloat. In addition, half the total food waste in the US happens at the farm level, due to reasons such as the food simply not being pretty enough.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    By connecting the producer directly to the consumer, we are able to solve all the aforementioned problems. Imagine that 1000 residents of LA County buy milk once a week. If all 1000 residents commited to buying milk every Friday for 3 months, then we would be able to lower their costs due to mass buying. The farmers would be happy because they have guaranteed customers for the next three months, and the consumers would be happy to get better access as well as lower prices.
