                    Website:
                    <a href="http://speaky.club/" rel="nofollow">
                        Speaky.club
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users tell Speaky (using text or voice in their home language, or by submitting a photo) what they want to talk about in a foreign language. Speaky responds with a selection of words and phrases in that language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help users master this foreign vocabulary, Speaky then creates custom flashcards. These can be reviewed later, or the user can enter a &ldquo;Quiz&rdquo; mode that intelligently adapts as the user progresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built two ways to access Speaky: 1) a text service using Twilio, and 2) a Facebook Messenger chatbot to make it easy for the 900 million Messenger users to access the service. We are using IBM Watson&rsquo;s translator API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One challenge was that image recognition was not always spot-on. (We are using Microsoft Cognitive Services.) We adapted by suggesting possibilities that the user can select from in their own language before getting the translation.
