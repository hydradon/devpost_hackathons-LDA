                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Professor Castilla's interactive artworks and aspired to replicate those experiences in a messaging app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in a room goes to a website. One person sends a message to the server. The server randomly chooses one person in the room to send the message to. Then, that person's phone plays a sound at a low pitch. Whatever phone's closest to that phone and able to hear that sound will then pick up the message and play a sound at a higher pitch. The process continues until all the phones in the room have picked up the message, while the sound played gets progressively higher. Once the pitch reaches a pre-set maximum, all of the phones will play one sound together. A new message can now be sent and the process continues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a server-client framework with node.js and socket.io, then used the Wad library to recognize a sound's frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our group had previous experience with Socket.io
Lack of sleep

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our fully functional program

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a server-client framework with node.js and socket.io. We also learned how to use the Wad library to recognize and produce sound of uniform pitch.

                    What's next for Mockingbyrd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will go on to live out our dreams of being Computer Science majors, except for Nabeel, who studies physics (&ldquo;a more pure science&rdquo;) and thinks that he is above CS.
