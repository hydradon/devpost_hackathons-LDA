                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app. We used the 2 "Open Weather Map" APIs to get the current and future weather conditions. We used Java and XML in the Android Studio to make the front-end and back-end of the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially not able to call the API, but we figured it out. 
We were initially not able to make a good layout using Relative Layouts, but we figured it out.
We had difficulty in sorting and sifting through the huge JSON Object that contained the API, but we figured it out.
Finally, we struggled a little bit with adding icons and pictures to our project, but we figured it out

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn and understand Android Studio and calling APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Android Studio, Calling APIs, JAVA, XML

                    What's next for Wear Weather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to improve the layout and make Wear Weather more efficient in terms of logic.
