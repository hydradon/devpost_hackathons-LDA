                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to make connections with large health datasets from fitness trackers, but due to the lack of cross-platform support for some of the major brands (...Apple...) we decided to seek out other existing large sets of data to manipulate, leading us to statistics on major world issues and charities associated with them.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects people to charities that support causes they care about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mobile app with react-native for the mobile application itself and used ruby-on-rails for the RESTful backend services that access our postgresql database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time ensuring our navigation stack hierarchy followed industry standards and was well organized. We also spent copious amounts of time researching and implementing APIs to access charity and cause information. A lot of those APIs are served by under-budget organizations with little motivation to provide the data in a meaningful manner.
                </p>
