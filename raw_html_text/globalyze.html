                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to take advantage of innovative hardware along with hard-to-digest public data available to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Globalyze displays city data on an interactive globe in virtual reality. No keyboard input is required, and the project is
                    <strong>
                        100% interactive
                    </strong>
                    . There are multiple modes to visualize the data: weather, hackathon, Yelp, Twitter, and apocalypse. Given the modularity of the modes, this app is intelligently extensible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was separated into two parts: the visual aspects in C# for Unity, and the data end in Python/Flask integrating APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hashing the idea out took a long time - we began our journey with the idea of a pet rock simulator and, after much contemplation and discussion, the project evolved into the global analytics app it is now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop a project that is applicable to a diverse range of settings. SDHacks was also one of our teammates' first hackathons, so we are extremely proud that we could come this far together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to split a project into modular and distinct tasks, which was crucial to this project as the project had two core parts that needed to be executed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Globalyze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky's the limit! Modes and APIs can be added flexibly as the user desires.
