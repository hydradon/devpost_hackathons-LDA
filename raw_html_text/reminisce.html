                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this project stems from my interest in accessing old memories with friends and family. With this application, I can look back to any date and read past messages with any person.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Purpose: Open any saved message from any date. Simply type in a date to begin. After reading over all the messages from that date, type in any unique part of the title to open all the messages with that phrase.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using Bash and a GUI library called CocoaDialog.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a newcomer to shell-scripting, I found learning the language in a few hours to be quite challenging! I struggled with opening files with a particular name, but ultimately figured it out with the help of various documentation and other peers. Finally, I worked with a new library named CocoaDialog which gave me some interesting outputs from time to time, but was able to parse through them and achieve my intended result.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning shell scripting was difficult, but I'm proud I was able to create such a program and even develop a GUI for it. Furthermore, it was my first solo hack-- I worked along to create this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bash is an interesting language. It might be easier to do everything in Python!
                </p>

                    Implementation in another language(such as Python) in order to add more GUI elements and parse through the titles of various messages.
