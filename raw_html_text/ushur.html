                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for ushur came from our own experiences with productivity, especially when using apps like Gmail, Slack, and Trello. We had difficulty finding files that we wanted and we struggled to keep track of the different tasks that we had due because it was hard to manage several projects at the same time. We often spent excessive amounts of time completing mundane tasks like responding to emails because we were too stressed to think straight and we wanted to remove these bottlenecks from our schedules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ushur pulls tasks from your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Trello accounts automatically and it can sort tasks based on the deadline, the type of task, or the contact that's associated (e.g., email Carol). Simple tasks like "respond to Carol's email" will have suggested replies under them, which allows users to respond to people by simply clicking an autogenerated reply. It helps people breeze through simple tasks and also lays out the larger tasks that need to be completed. The simple interface minimizes potential distractions and we wanted to emphasize few key features so that it would actually make people more productive, rather than distracting them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, specifically node.js and react, and HTML/CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered difficulties using the Slack API and were not experienced enough to be able to use natural language processing (NLP) to detect tasks in emails and Slack conversations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team of three includes two first-time hackers with little to no experience with programming. We learned to use GitHub, Atom, Cloud9, command line, node.js, and various APIs over the past 36 hours and were able to develop integrations with Google, Trello, and Slack services!
