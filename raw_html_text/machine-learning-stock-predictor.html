                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a website that would be used to predict information that can be used in the real world. Seeing how stock investment is a huge part of the financial tech industry, we designed a predictor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizes machine learning and various API's to predict future stock prices for various companies. The user can type in multiple stocks and get graphs about past data of the stock as well as popularity on twitter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end was programmed with the python flask library and the front end was made with bootstrap and charts.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges in allowing multiple stocks to be shown as well as processing data to show its trend with its corresponding predictions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a fairly clean front end, that is very easy to manage and use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about both the uses of machine learning and its real-world implications, as well as the use of open-source visualization software/libraries.
                </p>

                    What's next for Machine Learning Stock Predictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .To build a more user-friendly front end and possible give users the ability to create an account and manage what stocks they are watching, as well as send them notifications when a stock is being talked about on twitter or for variations in its price differential. We also hope to add the ability to give more in depth data analytics.
