                <p>
                    Stockbroker visualizations make much more sense than the typical banking app "Balance: $". This app will give people much more control over their own finances and spending decisions. Additionally, in the tips section, the app makes recommendations to help the user save money, which can be monetized through advertising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives a couple of different ways to visualize your financial life, then gives recommendations to help you meet your savings goals. The app breaks down the user's finances into several different graphs and charts, then provides the user with tips on how he or she can do better in the future.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Swift iOS app and a web application that takes data from our custom python/flask API which in turn draws from Nessie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a frontend proved difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a good system for managing the Nessie data, bundling it, and handling it with our custom API. Our recommendations system is also very useful. Our analysis tools are actually helpful to the user, and provide the user with a visual depiction of the state of their finances rather than simply showing them a number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rosi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuing to build on the analysis tools we provide to users. Possible machine learning integration in the future.
