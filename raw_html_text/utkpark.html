                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many other college students, we have always had problems finding parking on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app find the nearest vacant parking garage based on the amount of spots left in each lot in UTK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through utilizing Google Maps API, and Android development Studio, we used Java to build the application and it multiple features such as path finding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into plenty of issues when it came to the implementation and editing of the API's used within our program. Another challenge we ran into was to try to include all the features in our model into the working prototype of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to fully utilize the Google Maps API to find and mark the lots on campus for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build an app for the Android mobile platform from the ground up while integrating API's to help accomplish our goals. We also learn how to utilize the best aspects of each teammate to build our app most effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UTKPark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for UTKPark would be to do auto-tracking for the lot capacity through using image-recognition on cameras that could be set up at the entrance of each lot that would track the cars leaving and entering each lot. The cameras can then retroactively update the capacity of each lot in real time.
