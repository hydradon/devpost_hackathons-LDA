                    URL is web.cs.sunyit.edu/~alberta1/HackBU/index.html
Below it wouldn't let us enter it there because it didn't include "www" or "http://"

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expensive Textbooks...

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is more of a proof-of-concept, that connects students to other students on the same campus, and allows people to sell their used Textbooks to incoming students for a much cheaper (potentially free) price. This website also shows the required books for each course provided, unique to the two colleges chosen for the proof-of-concept (BU, and SUNY Poly).

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used web design (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery), and SQL. We were originally trying to use php and mySQL to connect the database to the webpage, but things got too complicated for 24 hours so we made it with static data in the html page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated above, we couldn't manage to connect the database and the website within 24 hours, so we used static data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more php and sharpened our web design skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly learned php, as stated above. I don't know about the rest of the group, but I personally (Anthony Albertina), learned I love hackathons and want to attend/learn much more. Somehow, I even enjoyed staying up for 24 hours straight coding! I learned I love the fields of Computer Science/Information Systems, and will probably have a career I love!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Book Relay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this seems to be a good idea to others, it could develop into a website for all colleges, with database entries for all courses and book requirements. Also, it would store the current local bookstore price to show how much students will save shopping at book relay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Note*
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to store the website and sql page on our college server at web.cs.sunyit.edu/~alberta1/HackBU/index.html, because we felt that would be faster than using domain.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Points for improvement
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We were trying to add user input, but didn't have enough time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to the time constraint, we were not DRY proof (Don't Repeat Yourself), and the javascript/jQuery could be very much trimmed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One bug I couldn't get out was when you select "CS240", the entry would appear, and then when you change to a different course it would stay there. If the code was cleaned up this could be easily fixed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
