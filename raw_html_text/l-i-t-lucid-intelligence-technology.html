                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans a user's face, and then using facial recognition, tracks the user's eyes and their rate of fast and slow blinks. Comparing the rate of the two, the program decides whether the user needs to stop and rest or continue.

                <p>
                    Using python and the dedicated libraries necessary.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In poor lighting situations we find it would miss or misinterpret a blink, but it would not interfere with the rate so badly that it would not stop the program from doing its job. Just need an answer for better lighting. Also at first it had trouble registering blinks from people with small eyes, hence why we added the scan feature. Variables change depending on the user's eye shape.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually be able to implement facial recognition for the first time, EVER. Most of us had no experience in python or facial recognition, so able to have a working program after the 12 hours is amazing.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and its object oriented libraries. Being able to build a script that takes in live data from hardware input and being able to do something with this data and push something out to the user.

                <p>
                    Implementing a way to track the eyes in dark situations and improving ways to prevent human error.
