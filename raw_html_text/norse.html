                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had 3 Vives!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One person is the Hero who is in a first person view with locomotion. Two other players are the Gods. One is Freyr, who is helpful and wins if the Hero is successful. The other is Loki who wins if the Hero fails. The Hero starts on his journey and must rely on Freyr to build out his path to Midgard. Meanwhile Loki can place several traps along the Hero's path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, 3 Vives, 2 Vive Trackers, 3 amazing artists, and 3 incredible coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a system for snapping together blocks to form a path was very difficult in Unity. Getting the IK rigging to work well with the models and the situation also took several hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The feeling of looking up to see to Gods deciding your fate. The feeling of looking down and seeing another live human running through the path laid out and the realization that you control their fate! The grid system we created for placing blocks to build the path was a major accomplishment!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rotation is hard and IK isn't much easier!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Norse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking at building it out and playing with some of the mechanics to see how much more engaging it can be.
