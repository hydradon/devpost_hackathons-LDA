                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were browsing different types of media for our project to try for inspiration, when we came across a 3D video from one of our team member's friends. There was no way to navigate around or see what could be important&mdash;we saw this as an opportunity to hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leap through Space is a controller to navigate through 3D video using hands and a Griffin Powermate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Leap Motion and Griffin for our input, Unity for gesture algorithms and collision testing, OSC to send data from Unity to Open Frameworks, and Open Frameworks to map 2D video onto a virtual 3D object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because there were so many layers of transferring data, we had a difficult time testing and making sure things were compatible. We would have to completely sort out one bottleneck before we could see if another could work with it, which slowed us down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to get Leap Motion to send data across computers was a big win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of libraries out there are deprecated, and sometimes you just have to deal with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leap through Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a much higher fidelity physical prototype
