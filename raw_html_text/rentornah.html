                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning trip logistics calls for upfront research, booking and balancing travel time and money spent - precious resources while traveling. Facing a similar situation while planning a trip to Hawaii with his parents, one of our teammates came up with the idea.

                    Rentornah, pronounced as rent or nah helps you and travelers alike compare modes of transportation, bus uber and car rentals to the places you'll visit during your trip. It solves the problem of doing research on bus routes, uber rates and car rental rates by displaying all of the info in one place - saving you time and helping travelers decide how best to get around a city.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized these APIs:
Expedia's Things To Do, Hotel Search, Car Search and Region Suggestion API, Google Maps, and Uber's API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web application is built with React and Reflux, styled adequately with Callemall's Material UI and compiled together with Webpack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members learnt varying different versions of React, so it was extremely annoying to consolidate our code, share ideas because of the plethora of things that were deprecated, changed or down right unsupported. Call-em-all's Material UI, although being a nice React framework for Material Design components, was unnecessarily difficult to style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to ramp up and code in ES6 for React,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Come prepared with a well thought out idea, problem, solution, business value, and rough design concepts. Always control the scope of the project.
Work in small bits, and always strive to get to a minimal viable product: a skateboard is better than a half built car.
Know when to say NO to new ideas or spins on the original plan.
                </p>
