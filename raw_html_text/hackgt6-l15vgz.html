                    We wanted to make something cool. Something none of us had ever done before, and learn from it. Coincidentally, one of us bought an echo dot in the past few days, so we decided to play around with our shiny new toy. We used tools like neural networks for natural language processing and generation, tools on the cloud like AWS Lambda and EC2 for hosting our code, and finally an interactive experience with our users using Alexa. Granted there were challenges both for us, and the technologies we were using, but without a doubt we all learned a lot from this experience.
