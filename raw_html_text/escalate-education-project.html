                    One major problem in modern classrooms is that teachers only teach at one pace to a class with students with different levels of previous knowledge and skill. This application was created to ensure that students who are having trouble do not fall behind in classes. To do so, this application assists teachers by allowing them to monitor the progress of each student in their school work to determine which students they should focus their time and resources on in class.
