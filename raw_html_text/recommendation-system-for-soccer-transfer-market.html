                <p>
                    The math works. Over the course of a season, there's some predictability to baseball. When you play 162 games, you eliminate a lot of random outcomes. There's so much data that you can predict: individual players' performances and also the odds that certain strategies will pay off.

                    In 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100+ years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games by applying sabermetric methods.
There are many models for different games but I didnt come across any such paper or article which tells us the method to create a model for soccer transfer market recommendation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It aims to provide transfer market recommendations based on the player's potential and recent performances that would help the team perform better (with given constraints).

                <p>
                    Step-wise Method
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. Predict the market value of the player based on input feature 
b. Predict the Form of the player based on his last 5 year performance 
c. Derive an equation for Impact Score of the player (combination of player potential and recent history)
d. Calculate the MVP of the player which is a function of Market Value and Impact Score
e. Use constrained programming to come up with a set of optimal recommendations for the transfer market.

Constraints - Budget (Market Value + Weekly Wage), Squad Size, Player Position
Challenges - Trade-off between quality and quantity
Trade-off between positions (attacker vs defender)

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a. DATA (more than 90% time was spent on data collection)
b. 1-1 Mapping between different datasets (Manual annotation) - ~ 2 hrs to run once
c. Important Data points missing for calculating impact score (match-winning goals/assists, penalty wins, accuracy etc)
d. Incomplete Data in FIFA (not all clubs in Top 5 are listed)
e. No PRIOR Work for Model Creation and lot of constraints
f. Manually creating different functions for Impact Score.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its very hard to model real-life events to a mathematical model. Collecting data is one of the most challenging tasks of machine learning. I learned to experience the effects of regularization, bias-variance trade-off on real data-sets and see how to tune different hyperpaprameters.

                    a. Getting the time-constraint working to get the optimal solutions
b. Collecting more data points to improve our Form Accuracy
c. NLP on Football Commentary to infer important events of a match
d. Applying Game Theory (Online Learning Theory) to implement strategies against specific teams.
e. Optimized-Squad Selection and strategies based on Frame Analysis and heat-maps.
