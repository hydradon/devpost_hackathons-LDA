                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    people who get into accidents (on the streets i.e. a shooting) may require medical attention faster than by calling an ambulance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Application to allow the public to have quick access to anyone who has medical, first aid, or CPR training when needed
A free service that stores the information of doctors, nurses, paramedics and other trained individuals as 'helpers' on a server if they choose to register as a 'helper'. Any member of the public can use the help function from the app, however they would be encouraged to enter some medical history in case they are unable to communicate a their situation to the doctor coherently. (i.e person with stroke collapses and can move but cannot clearly speak, the medical history helps)
When someone pushes the help button on the app. Their location is gathered via GPS and sent to the server (firebase). The server will then notify doctors within a certain area of the person in need. Help Me will immediately prompts them to accept or deny helping the person, while showing the fastest route to the person on a map. If they accept, the person in need is notified (eases their mind).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone with the app can call for help even if it is not for them. It is also more immediate than calling an ambulance (but it is not a substitute)

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Android studios, Google firebase platform for push notification, and the Here.com API , server, and location utilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used android studio, Google Firebase, or Here.com's map API before, and so everything we did we had to learn and build from scratch. We under-estimated how much time the idea would take to complete and in the end we were unable to complete the project's server. We also learned that there are technical challenges in push notification itself and that the current push notification platforms such as Google Firebase do not guarantee 100% successful delivery.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to achieve push notification of a user and calculate fastest route between helper and person in need of help.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use android studio, Google firebase and Here.com's location API. Also learned about using APIs in general
