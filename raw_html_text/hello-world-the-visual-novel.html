                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a lighthearted game that people could laugh about while poking fun at our own degree.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive story telling game with branching paths that allows the user to pursue

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ren'Py, a visual novel engine that uses Python at it's core with several built in tools to make the process easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build the game with java and JavaFX at the start, but could not get it working in time. To solve this, we used Ren'Py to build the game.
Also, the .zip file of the game was too large to directly upload to github, so we had to move it to our repository and commit it to get it on github.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a branching narrative revolving around fun characters with unique traits using an unfamiliar toolkit.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to create variables, methods and eventually entire programs in Ren'Py.

                <p>
                    Additional characters with longer routes, to flesh out both the personalities and the world the game is set in.
