                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is estimated that worldwide, nearly 44 million people have Alzheimer&rsquo;s or a related dementia, with only 1-in-4 cases medically diagnosed. If detected early enough, one can explore treatments that may provide some relief of symptoms and help one maintain a level of independence longer. There needs to be a solution that allows at-risk subjects to be monitored for dementia without taking their dignity.

                    Insight quizzes users on a variety of engaging, short-term, trivia-style memory questions and tracks their performance over a period of time. This information can be displayed to show if poor performance is simply a matter of everyday forgetfulness or cognitive degeneration.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using a Meteor backend, storing our data in a Mongo Database. We used React on the front end to create a clean user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this hackathon with the intention of learning some new frameworks. We had never worked with React or Meteor before and there was indeed a learning curve. We are proud of the way we toughed out the work and managed to complete a functional app with brand new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a clean app using state-of-the-art technologies that provide a clean interface, crisp data visualization, and a resilient back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to learning two new technologies, we also loved the ability to collaborate with and meet other students from other universities and create an app that targets our senior citizens, an important set of our community that is only growing.
