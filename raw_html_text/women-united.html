                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own life with our classes and our all girls engineering living learning community. Having a group of student and teachers there to support your gave us this unyielding confidence to tackle anything that comes in our way. With the Douglass Living Learning Community, we were able to discuss things we go through with peers and alumnae who have previous gone through them. We were able to get there knowledge and support to be able to handle everything..

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple platform to share your story and ask for advice from other women in STEM. This will encourage women to join and stay in the STEM field.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MongoDB to make a database and we used Node.js as our backend and frontend.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first time doing any project with websites and javascript and node.js we had to learn everything and took a lot of time just understanding what we were doing. Then to the actual setting up of the database and server was another challenge because we have never done anything like this. Lastly we also had to learn javascript( a basic amount) and how to use node.js
