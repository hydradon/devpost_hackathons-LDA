                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the data visualizations shown on the webpages for the city budgets of Oakland, Philadelphia and Boston.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project consists of an interactive Sankey diagram detailing the appropriation of budget for the 2015 fiscal year for the city of New Brunswick, New Jersey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Data Visualization API to create the Sankey diagram, and experimented with various D3.js functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to adjust the Google API, so that we could have more freedom over the Sankey diagram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to quickly create a functioning data visualization for a large amount of data, that greatly resembles the products that we were attempting to recreate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the proper choice of design and programming tools can reduce a difficult task into a more manageable one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NB Financial Data Visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on creating a database to hold various city expenditure statistics, and auto-generating the Sankey-diagrams for the future.
