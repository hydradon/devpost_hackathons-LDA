                    I was trying to implement Deep Q Learning in

                    , which runs in the Bizhawk emulator and requires a Windows installation of Torch via Lua. It took me 24 hours to manually install this torch library, so with the remaining time I decided to build a Windows binary installer for users who need to use Torch on Windows.

                    In my installation of Torch, I used 7 different command prompts to manually determine dependencies,

                    In my attempt to build a binary installer for Torch, I used C++ libraries to automate downloads, building, and testing.

                    Managed to go through long, messy, and incorrect instructions and actually made the library work. Github master pull requests are often approved even though they might break builds.

                    Open-source projects, even those built by the likes of Facebook can be terribly unusable.
