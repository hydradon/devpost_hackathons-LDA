                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The new Rutgers laundry app, SpeedQueen is really poorly coded. It's very glitchy, and people have even reported it as being easily susceptible to hackers stealing personal data, and that it can steal money from people's accounts without actually doing a laundry cycle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely nothing. But it doesn't glitch out or steal your money so it's better than SpeedQueen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python 2.7
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is much better than SpeedQueen.

                    Not much

                    What's next for ReliabilityQueen:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hopefully Rutgers will adopt it in place of SpeedQueen, but who knows?
