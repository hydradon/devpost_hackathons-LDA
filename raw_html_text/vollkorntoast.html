                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you shop on a mobile Device, you don't want to search around -&gt; you just want all the ingredients for your recipe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It compares the Product you put in your basket with well rated recipes over the API from spoonacular . Out of that it predicts what you want to buy next from the different categories.
You put Toast Bread and Cheese in your basket so it might guess Ham and Pineapple for Toast Hawai. It presents you those ingredients as a recommendation. So you complete your basket much faster.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with the Data form the HelloFresh Data Challenge. We translated them and enriched them with Data from the USDA National Nutrient Database.
Scraped nutrition data from the MyFitnessPal site to have a bigger database
We took most liked Recipe Data over spoonacular API. 
We didn't have enough time to build the whole Front End, so we improvised and built a Mockup.
