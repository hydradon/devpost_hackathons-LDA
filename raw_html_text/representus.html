                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people do not know their government representatives such as their mayors, state governors, senators, and house representatives. With such little knowledge on their representatives, people will only hear about politicians who have the power and money to expand their influence. Representus provides an easy access for people to learn about the government officials around them as well as the ones around them who are running for office.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Representus provides one single application that has information on the user's government representatives from the local area to statewide. The application will search through its database for information on the government officials who are near them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React.js to make our website easier to navigate. We also used the CSS framework, Bootstrap, to further stylize our website. In order to store the data of people running for office, we used Firebase to store their information on a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulty using React.js because we did not fully understand the syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together as a group to create a working application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React.js and CSS frameworks to  improve our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Representus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect the Paypal API, so users can donate money to any politician they want. Also, we want to include a location services API such as Google Maps, so the user can quickly use their location to find government officials around them.
