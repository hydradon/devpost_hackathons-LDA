                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I interview some Business companies that  uses SMS as their main ways of communicating 
their business endavour to their clients,customers etc. The response I got was that SMS could have been the best option
against Email Messages, if there is a way to Store, Warehouse  SMS Text Messages and Multi-Media Files
already sent to their Customers devices,desktop applications for future retrival,Editing,Resending and for other purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proffessor Mike Filler in my school who owns a Shopping Mall also Point out that SMS text Messages seems to be a use and throw away data and thus does not store data unlike Email while some Business specialist in my vicinity  who owns Butticks, Large Supermarkets, Agriculturist etc complains
that their customer services recieve thousands of SMS text Messages in a day and that scrolling of the phones in search of SMS,
sorting of the sms text Messages and Media Files in order to be able to respond back to their customers is time consuming and
sometime absolutely impossible in a high traffic SMS reception environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr &amp; Mrs. Richard Moore who owns a construction Company where I did my Industrial Training as a IT. Scientist points out that its
true that SMS is faster than Email in terms of real time messaging but they still need to have all their SMS Messages stored
somewhere in the could as a data where they can get it anytime anyday. He also points out that the SMS Messages should be sent
on 1-to-1 basis(ie Peer to Peer sms text messagings) with caging process that prevent for instance  prevents
                    <b>
                        User C
                    </b>
                    from
having access to conversation that exist between
                    <b>
                        UserA
                    </b>
                    and
                    <b>
                        User B
                    </b>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Dad points out that if an SMS app could be built to meet up all the functions above,it will make the app most suitable in
                    <b>
                        Ticket System
                    </b>
                    because since sms is a realtime messaging protocols and the app also provides one to one SMS Chat
communications, it will make tracking of Messages,complains, issues etc on Tickets System very easy on each Users(Customers)Uniquely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I  Learnt from Inspiration and Interview above
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have seen reason why many companies are using Emails as means of communication with their customers and Clients as oppossed
to using SMS which provides faster realtime messages. I also learnt that:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A.) Every Company, School, Organisation needs their SMS Data/information to be stored somewhere in the cloud where
it can easily  be retrieved,edit, further process or even resend.
                    <br>
                    2.) I learnt there is a need for communication contuniuty especially in Tickets System where a Customer ask or sent a complain and the issue has to be tackled my sending a follow up messages in real time.
                    <br>
                    3.) I also learnt that a company can have more than 1 million customers and there is a need to have to 1-to-1 message exchange which only SMS peer to peer technology can provide.
                    <br>
                    4.) Many More ......
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is on my mind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SMS Chat Messenger is a messaging service built on sms technology Powered by Whispir.Io
                    <br>
                    The More I looked at Whispir.Io technology, the more I think of Whispir SMS not only as way of sending just text messages
and Media files to users devices but also as a database for data storage(Eg. For Schools, Companies, Transportaions, E-commerce etc.).
                    <br>
                    Thinking of it as an SMS Chat messenger. I apply the ease of mobile messengers to Whispir SMS's protocol,thereby creating a universal communication platform available to anyone with an mobile number. (as opposed to Whatsapp/FB Messenger closed networks)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that allows Sending,Re-sending,Tracking and Sharing of sms text messages, Multi-Media files eg Photos via Peer to peer(1-to-1) sms Protocols
Eg. between one user and another, between a company and its clients etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to use the app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.) Create one time registration using your mobile contact and then login.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.) Sending and Sharing of SMS Text Messages and Media Files can be accomplished in 3 ways stated below:
                    <br>
                    A.) Search the user you want to sms to from the
                    <b>
                        search box using her mobile number or names
                    </b>
                    . once the user is populated,
click on the user and navigate to the users profile to start sending sms via 1-to-1 sms chat protocol.
                    <br>
                    B.) You can also send SMS by clicking on
                    <b>
                        Add People
                    </b>
                    Button, select the User you are looking for and start sending sms
                    <br>
                    C.) You can also send SMS from your
                    <b>
                        friend list
                    </b>
                    .
To do this you can either search the user from the
                    <b>
                        search box via mobile no, names etc
                    </b>
                    or click on
                    <b>
                        Add People
                    </b>
                    to send
                    <b>
                        friend request
                    </b>
                    to that user, when the user acceppts your request, He or she automatically appears in 
Friend list and from there you can start sending SMS and Multi-Media Files.click on
                    <b>
                        Load More Button
                    </b>
                    if you need to load more friends..
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    3.)SMS Alert Components keeps track of SMS Notifications that were sent to your devices. You can reply sms messages sent
to you using this option.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.) SMS History: Keeps timely Tracks of all the SMS text Messages and Files you sent to your friends, customers etc. 
It provides with option to edit, resend and delete already sent SMS text Messages and Files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What happen when you sent a File(Eg. Photo) to Recipients via the app.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The files get sent via the SMS Chat System immediately so that the recipient can see it if he or she is online.
                    <br>
                    But because its an uploaded file not just a text message, whispir does not currently
have a way of sending the files directly to recipient devices. So what the app do is to send the files full link to the Recipient devices via Whispir
SMS. The recipient can then download the file by typing the link on a browser or by clicking on adownload button within
the app (SMS Chat Messaging System).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The App can easily be integrated into social network, businesses, Transportations,

                <p>
                    Building a Peer to Peer(1 to 1) SMS Chat Technology is very hard to accomplish. combining Files Sharing with text messages
is hard as well. Online and offline presence of each user is also hard to accomplish
