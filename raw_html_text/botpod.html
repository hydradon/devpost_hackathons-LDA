                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of bottles get landfilled, and recycling is an imperfect, highly energy intensive process. We want to up-cycle used glass and plastic bottles. Hydroponics (growing plants in water without soil) is an easy way to grow plants indoor without mess and requiring less care than a regular plant. The BotPod combines both principles: to use up-cycle used bottles into water &amp; nutrient vessels for growing small ornamental plants or culinary herbs indoors.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A container for hydroponic grow substrate, insert into the opening of used bottles to grow plants and herbs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We rapid-prototyped with Fusion 360 and 3D printing.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had no prior experience with Fusion 360 or 3D printing.

                <p>
                    Successfully learned and applied Fusion 360 and 3D printing to create a functional prototype.
                </p>

                    What's next for BotPod
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will explore the option of adding IoT capacity to the BotPod to make it smarter and refine the design to use less material and to be able to fit into more bottle types (currently fits glass wine bottle &amp; PET soda bottle). We will also study the potential market for this type of product.
