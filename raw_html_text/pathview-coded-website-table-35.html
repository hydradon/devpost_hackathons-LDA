                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students interested in STEM, we all have been applying to summer internships. Unfortunately, there was no way to know what internships were available to us without having to look low and high for different websites on the internet. Often times, we would look through the whole website and then find out that we were not eligible to apply. We decided to create PathView to combat this issue, by creating one website that has all of the internships that are perfect for a user based on their basic information and interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PathView is a service website which allows high school students to discover different summer programs accessible in their area. Our company name, PathView demonstrates our main goal, helping people easily view and discover their career paths! The younger generation are our leaders, we believe that preparing them for the future, gives us a brighter tomorrow. PathView answers the prompt very directly- it helps our community by giving students clear opportunities to enhance their passions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PathView is an extremely organized and accessible website! A student can find desired programs with only one click of a button. The first home page asks the user one main question: the subject the user is interested in. The page then takes you to a variety of programs within your area. You can then choose a desired program after customizing the search engine to your preferences. On the left side of the website, it gives the user the choice of the program location, and price. After the user chooses their desired program, they can click on it and it takes them to another page with a variety of important information, such as costs, eligibility, and resource websites! If desired, you can even submit an internship for other people to view and apply to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to code the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had a good amount of experience with HTML, so we were learning how to code in HTML as we built the website. This caused a lot of hiccups along the way, and places where we were not sure about what to do next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we accomplished a whole coded website with HTML with no prior experience. We worked as a team and we are proud of our final result!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned different platforms of code such as HTML and CCS. We also learned man y new presentation techniques such as Spark Slideshow and Video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PathView
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more features such as different internships in other locations.
