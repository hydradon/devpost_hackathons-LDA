                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holiday season is coming up but it can be tiring standing in long lines and you could be missing on the next biggest sale at another store.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans the store ID, allows you to start scanning product UPC codes, puts them in a virtual shopping cart and you can pay using PayPal or VISA.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build an android app which required Java and Android studio. Also we had to use a database and OrchestrateIO provided a database as a service which allowed us to easily store data in the form of a dictionary. The backend is hosted on Amazon AWS and is built using the Flask framework for python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a secure payment system was a struggle as no one had experience with that before. Android Studio was also difficult but a learning experience nonetheless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't get much sleep (haha). As a team, we're proud we were able to finish this hack in a short amount of time and still learn a lot about android app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make a request to connect front end to backend. Do not drink too much redbull! Get some sleep next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CHECKOUT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, CHECKOUT can be scalable and have a better UI. Adding a more secure payment system and expanding it to countries beyond Canada.
