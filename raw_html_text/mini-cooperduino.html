                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Free time and a dream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gutted a mini Mini-Cooper RC car and replaced it with love but more importantly a bluetooth adapter and Arduino board. Now we use our phone to control it with the gyroscope as if it were a steering wheel.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering the board and soldering it outside against the elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It works! And has three user modes to choose form which function super duper well. You are going like the way it runs, I guarantee it.
