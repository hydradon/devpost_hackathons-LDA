                    talked about their causes and we realized lack of funding is a real need a lot of charities are struggling with.

                    Cents of Purpose is a web app that allows users to sign up with a credit card and round all their purchases up to the nearest dollar and donate the change to a charity of their choosing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js for our backend which incorporates the Stripe and Plaid API's to round all credit card purchases to the nearest dollar and charge the difference and send that change to the users selected charity .  We used React to handle our front end, which displays the available charities and allows users to see a statement displaying all their donations to charity.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about how we could best use our skills as developers to help the community and these charities representing groups in need.  After much discussion, we decided creating an app that generates additional funding for organizations that are already established and offering direct help to the community, would be the most impactful way we could help.

                    We are proud of the progress we made in our backend and incorporating the Stripe and Plaid API's.

                    We learned a lot about Node.js and React.

                    Next steps for our project would be to allow users to set preferences in advance and donate to different charities every month automatically without having to manually change their settings.
