                    The Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last week, while we were planning a gathering for our friends, we chose a restaurant that one of us frequented: a restaurant that served the best sushi in the state (in my opinion). To our dismay, several of our friends told me that they preferred a change of restaurant due to dietary preferences: we didn't realize that this restaurant wasn't vegetarian-friendly, nor was it keto-friendly. After this experience, we realized that food can unite us, but it can also highlight our differences.

                    The Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to spend Dubhacks working on a platform that casts individuals with food restrictions into the focus, and not simply an afterthought. Our platform, Oregano Online, focuses on restaurants and other dining spots that cater to individuals with dietary restrictions. Moreso, future implementations include allowing the rating system to only factor in ratings that deal with the reviews that concerned a specific food restriction. We used a React boilerplate and set up a React app which renders the webpage. The frontend was designed with HTML, CSS, and React, and the backend is intended to be created through Google Sheets.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges along the way. One of the most significant of these was that the DNS would not properly propagate to Domain.com. Additionally, even getting started was difficult: the server didn't want to comply with our requests.
However, after this weekend, our team has both improved our understanding of Javascript, domains, Github, and React, and also, we have gained a newfound understanding of how difficult finding restaurants with food restrictions can be.
