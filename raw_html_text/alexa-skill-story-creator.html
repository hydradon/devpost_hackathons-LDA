                </h2>
                <p>
                    Story Creator is a random story generator. In this skill you can either select a story or Alexa will select a story for you.
Alexa will then ask you for 3-5 questions and then use your answers to generate a fun story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think fast and speak clearly! If you take too long or stutter Alexa might mishear you and include her own goofy word.
This Story Creator skill will provide hours of family fun. Right now we are providing 10 pretty good stories and we will be updating the story line with time.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Build it using Alexa developer console, Lambda Function and APL in nodejs

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Since APL is a new concept, we came across few issues related to APL like SpeakItem command with the AutoPage command not giving the expected output. Testing was also very hard as developer console was not reliable.
