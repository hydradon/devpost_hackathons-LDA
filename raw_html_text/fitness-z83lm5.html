                    We have made a website to help people come up with the perfect exercise routine just for themselves, so it saves them from wasting time trying to find premade workouts online to work on a specific body part. We used HTML and CSS to program the website, which we taught ourselves at the beginning of this event through a Code Academy course. We all are athletes who strive to be in shape and ready for our sports season, and with this efficient and motivating website, we and all other people desiring to exercise certain muscles can achieve their goals.
