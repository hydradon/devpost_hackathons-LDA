                <p>
                    Inspired by how hard it is to keep awake in the early hours during a hackathon. A VSCode extension which will alternately encourage, threaten and assist you as you work through the night.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is built primarily in node.js. The VSCode extension is built using VSCode's own tools, the phone interfacing is provided by Twilio, Twitter's own API is used in combination with a lightweight Chrome extension, and the majority of the code runs on a Google Cloud server attached to domain.com domain lookalivesunshine.tech. Coffee machine controlled by a Raspberry Pi with software written in python.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Difficulty getting Twilio to make phone call using a pre-recorded audio file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pushing Twitter code server-side proved quite complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that, on a software side, all the stages have at least a basic implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of us had node.js experience, and even that was minimal, so the vast majority of the node.js code.
How to use the Twilio and Twitter APIs.
