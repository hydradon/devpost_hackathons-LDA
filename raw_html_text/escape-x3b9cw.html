                        Simply, an interactive story mode game, where user receives multiple options and scenarios and must choose between given choices in order to attempt to achieve the best possible ending. It is possible to lose the game and be forced to restart.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -As beginner programmers, we used Java and implemented the use of multiple while statements and if loops. Used try and catch blocks to add text delay and also added different class and called them from the main method in order to have sounds and noises.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At the beginning we had problems with implementing noise, however with the help from one of the organizers, we were able to get through the problem and continue hacking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Honestly, since we're still newbies, we are just proud of being able to attend and learn as much as we have. We're also proud of being able to finish out first project in a hackathon.
