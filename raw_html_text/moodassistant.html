                    How we built it

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems that Google Home development documents changes a lot. The team seems to have quite important change on default fulfillment recently and almost all the examples and documents we could find are a little bit out-of-date. We have to do it on our own. The frontend team had a lot of struggle with relatively unfamiliar concepts like async.
