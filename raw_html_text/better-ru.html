                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make navigating around essential Rutgers website tools easier. We also wanted to have an easy way for students and professors to report cyber bullying, sexual harassment, drug abuse or any other negative issues that they are aware of. People will also be able to anonymously send tips to administrators at Rutgers University.

                    Our website contains links for all kinds of tools such as Blackboard, Rutgers News, Events, Campus Maps, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and a link to healthy foods around campus. Our website also contains a survey that allows users to interact with administrators anonymously or directly.
