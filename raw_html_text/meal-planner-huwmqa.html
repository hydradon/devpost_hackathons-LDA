For our hackathon we decided to build an IOS app which was designed to help students at Brown University manage their meal plans via recommendations that would maximize their food experience at Brown. We personalize students' experience by allowing them to create personal accounts via Google Cloud's Firebase. 
In order to implement the app, we utilized React Native and Firebase. 
Also, to truly personalize each user's experience, we tracked user history regarding what dining halls they visited and food they ate. We stored and analyzed this information to make the best recommendations to the user.
