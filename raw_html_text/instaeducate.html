                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the wealth of content on the internet, which can often make research difficult, especially for students. We wanted to make it more
                    <strong>
                        accessible for everyone
                    </strong>
                    , information one simple search away from being discovered. Time should not be a limitation to your learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InstaEducate summarizes resources... essentially,
                    <em>
                        putting the world at your fingertips.
                    </em>
                    We wanted to address the following questions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        What information would be most relevant to users in the current world?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do we want to present this information?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the present-day is so busy, how could we give users important information that they would be more to retain?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask web framework (working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and the News API Python library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, we had difficulty using web APIs, however after much trial and error we were able to use them effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our problem-solving skills and dedication in figuring out the API, in spite of the difficulty it presented. We are also proud of our idea, because we spent a lot of time brainstorming about how to make it most efficient and effective for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of the team, it was our first hackathon, so we learned how to collaborate on a project that has global, real world implications. We learned how to effectively divide the workload depending on each team member's strengths, and how to help each other out when we encountered difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaEducate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a login and registration system so users can save articles and share them with other users, to make InstaEducate even more collaborative. We would also like to refine the system so that it includes more specific topics within each category. We thought it would be interesting to include a section where users, volunteers, and mentors could write their own articles.
