                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The club.

                <p>
                    The project uses two myo armband sensors to record the position of the arms relative to each other at the end of the dab, as well as the acceleration of the dab motion. This data is put into an equation in order to generate a score out of 40 for your dab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project mostly using C++, since the myo armbands SDK were in C++. In addition, we used the Amazon AWS to host our website -
                    <strong>
                        demo.trevormccann.com
                    </strong>
                    , and used node.js and C++ Read to integrate the C++ code with the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we were planning to use the myo armbands to sense sign language and output that cross platform. However, we quickly realized that given the myo armbands design, this was not feasible. It was difficult to change ideas at that point given time constraints, so we were incentivized to try to incorporate the myo armbands somehow to our project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to successfully translate the raw data from the myo armbands into useful parameters for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the SDK of the myo armbands, expanded our C++ skillset, and learned how to use Amazon's AWS platform.
