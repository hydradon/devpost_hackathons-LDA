                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to write a tool to help developers
                    <strong>
                        write better code
                    </strong>
                    , something about using the Roslyn compiler and its Diagnostic API to analyze code and provide rule-based feedback and correction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that proved too difficult :(
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I made something much less ambitious, slightly more fun, and
                    <strong>
                        infinitely
                    </strong>
                    more useless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Also I just really wanted to use the
                    <a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/" rel="nofollow">
                        Closure Compiler
                    </a>
                    )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As always, step 1 is parsing. I use Closure Compiler to parse a JS file.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        an aside, you might be wondering why js? Because Closure Compiler parses JS, and I want to use it, that's why.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    I wrote a simple compilation pass that will print to stdout every time the compiler meets a variable name node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e.g. when parsing
                    <code>
                        var x = 1
                    </code>
                    , the compiler will print something like
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        VARNAME NAME x 1
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My language of choice for analytics is python, it comes with the fantastic library pandas. So the strategy here is to use python to start a subprocess that runs the compiler (jar file) with the right arguments, and capture all the stdout of the subprocess. We can then easily parse this output into a list of strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We transform whatever output the compiler emits into a list of variable names, i.e. from
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>VARNAME NAME x 1
VARNAME NAME y 1
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    to
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>x
y
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    So at the end of this step all we have left is a list of strings, and these strings are all the variable names used in the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can now do some magic on all these variables. Well, not really. I just wrote some simple string processing functions, I call them
                    <strong>
                        Analysis Engines
                    </strong>
                    , that try to capture interesting facts about the variable names. For example, length of the variable names, number of times a variable name was used, most popular prefix, most popular subsequence. From these we can ascribe characteristics to programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There characteristics are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        concise / verbose depending on the mean variable name length
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        camel case or underscore case depending on the style of the variable name
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Closure Compiler. I'm glad I have dug slightly into the source of the Closure Compiler, and wrote a
                    <a href="http://ngzhian.github.io/blog/what-the-heck-is-google-closure-compiler.html" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    about it too. That is a complicated piece of software. I took about an hour or so trying to get it to print the things I wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was using pandas. It is another complex piece of software, very very powerful, and I didn't that much experience. So I had to spend some time digging into the documentation wondering how to get the results I wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front end interaction took some time as well, I lack design skills but I didn't want things to be unusable. So I went with a minimalist look, just like my blog - black and white, some typography, font weights, font sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is probably thinking of what kind of metric about variable names would be interesting to us programmers And how to present this in a fun way. I went with the sarcastic comments, hopefully that's funny...

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio integration to sms you when the analysis is done. I did that and it worked in like one try. Two reason for that, I had used their API before, and Twilio API and documentation is just plain awesome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UX of the app. There's not much UX, but I did try my hands on it and made it such that buttons and text disappear/appear as necessary so users wouldn't be confused by it, and by users I mean just myself.

                    More about Closure Compiler. Recently I've been really interested in compilers and programming languages, so I have been finding excuses to work on something related to them. If I couldn't be hacking on the compiler or the language it self, at least I can use it do so something
