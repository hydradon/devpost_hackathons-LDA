                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After pursuing the internet as one does, I found the Instagram page for ForEva Strong, a baby with SMA or spinal muscular atrophy. This baby, named Eva Batista, needs treatment that is only available in the US for the steep cost of 2.1 million dollars. While I can't contribute much financially to this goal, I chose to take a different approach and consolidate their information into a more user-friendly environment to increase the likelihood of user participation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a simple website using Wix, an online website editor. The website itself contains the introduction to Eva's story including some very emotionally invoking images. Next, the website outlines what the cause is for and what the user can do to help. I tried to streamline the process between donating to gofundme, sharing the page, and hosting events. The next section of the site contains a contact box for users to directly email the gofundme coordinator, Eva's mother. The final section sets up a subscriber list for the family. I chose to include this because I felt that the family was losing user participation from lack of updates and with a subscriber list, the Batista family can email users new information regarding Eva's treatment and upcoming events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the sake of time and ease, I built this website using a simple website creator Wix. I also feel that long term this site will be beneficial to the family because it is something that they can pick up on themselves to regulate their own website after I notify them of the creation. Wix is meant to be easily understood which makes it a cheap, effective option for the Batista family to utilize in supporting their daughter. I used my general knowledge of file converting and style to create a template for the site that I thought would maximize user traffic and best benefit Eva's cause.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really proud of the aesthetic design of the site because I feel the muted tones really encapture the softness of infanthood but the message itself still rings true. I will be even more proud of this website proves successful in increasing the donation amounts that the family is receiving as recently the numbers have started to plateau.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned so much from this project, but mostly I learned the importance of community. I spent hours over this hackathon scouring the families Instagram and Facebook for information regarding Eva. With this research, I found the endless outpour of love and dedication of the Batista's community. I truly believe that their goal of $2.1 million is reachable with the power of the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ForEva Strong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next? I hope to unveil the website to the family soon and offer my services at upkeeping the website until they can learn to manage it themselves. I believe this website is a good solution to the families consolidation problem because it brings all the elements of their campaign into one space for users, rather than spreading them across platforms.
