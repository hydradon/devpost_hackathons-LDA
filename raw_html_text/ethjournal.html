                <p>
                    A decentralized peer-reviewed journal dapp on Ethereum

                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The existing process of publishing papers to academic journals involves a near-monopoly of publishers which basically act as middlemen and make the profits from a published paper. Additionally, there is very little incentive for peer reviewers to review the work of another colleague trying to get published. As a result most papers take more than 2 years to publish, and have on average ~2.3 peer reviews. We thought that this was a system that could benefit from decentralization, by replacing the publisher with the ethereum blockchain and solidity smart contracts, and introducing incentives for peer reviewers in the form of ethereum and/or reputation points.

                    What it('s supposed to) do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, a user can download or submit paper on the site. A special editor role is used to review submitted papers, select quality peer reviews, and determine whether the paper should be published, rejected, or needing revision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ETHJournal, in it's current state, consists of 2 smart contracts; one for the Journal itself, and another Paper contract used by each paper an author is publishing/has published. The Journal contract contains the logic for what a user should be presented with when they open the ETHJournal site. It contains 2 address arrays, one for authors and another for editors, and a mapping of paper addresses to booleans. If a user is neither an author nor editor, then they have only read access to the papers and the ability to sign up as either an author or editor. However, a user accessing a paper for the first time will be charged a one time transaction fee. If a user is an author, they have the ability to upload a paper and send it to an editor to get it published. An editor would be notified of the new paper and the Paper contract would select 3 unique authors, who did not author the same paper, to peer review the article.
