                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed and implemented an application that responds to HTTP requests from a server to send text messages.  Specific messages and phone numbers were given in a text package with the HTTP request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a simple HTTP server on the phone application.  It receives a request from the Qualcomm server, which was implemented with the google cloud.  The phone application keeps a log of requests and visualizes them on the app's interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members of our team had any Android development experience, so simple syntax and error reporting proved to be a challenge.  We also ran into many issues connecting our server to the google cloud, and many more issues connecting the cloud to our phone's server to send HTTP requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the amount of unguided learning we were able to do in such a condensed period of time, and creating a clean user interface for visualizing the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we had no previous android development experience, nor any experience with the google cloud, we had an immersive learning experience.  Most of our learning was through the debugging process, which was arduous yet rewarding upon success.

                    What's next for HandSPASMS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that HandSPASMS could serve as an adequate model for a final product that could soon be shipped.
