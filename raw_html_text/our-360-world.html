                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team visionary David, has spent the last two years of his life granting children in hospital wishes. For the kids who aren&rsquo;t able to step outside of the hospital, he brings them the outside world with the gift of VR. This brings many people great happiness as it empowers the powerless with the joy of the most simple of life&rsquo;s experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a wish granter and a content creator he often finds it hard to scale his wishes, because of the lack of a platform to source, share and curate immersive and rich content. He&rsquo;d also like to share this content without the bounds of language translation and to create an easier UI for VR users who don&rsquo;t have the physical ability to hold the VR wand or to see a menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hope and vision of the team was to build a platform for David to help with the health and wellness of not only the children he is helping in Toronto, Canada but for children everywhere. He wants to be able to create a curriculum to &ldquo;Train the Trainers&rdquo; so that people anywhere can request, upload and share VR content that can be localized for a memorable immersive experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In building out the specs for the platform, it became apparent after receiving feedback from the many subject manner experts and mentors is that what we were building is beyond an education tool, and really a platform to enable deployment of an immersive, accessible curriculum for multiple Sustainability Development Goals outside of education. This is why we think we&rsquo;re directly addressing SDG 9 Industry Innovation &amp; Infrastructure. One of the key opportunities listed under this SDG is to &ldquo;Impact and expand upon the achievement of other SDGs (e.g. Job Creation, Better Health, Better Education)&rdquo;, and we feel that our platform does exactly that.  This is how we came to the name of our project, Our 360 World.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our hope is that not only can Our 360 World affect kids and patients in hospitals, but also refugees, natural disaster crisis sufferers, and enterprising kids who want to learn the skills that are most relevant to them, and taught in an immersive yet localized format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our 360 World leverages many existing Facebook technologies to provide a robust and simple platform for users to consume both curated and discovered VR content.  Upon onboarding, a user signs up on the web app or a mobile app using Facebook OAuth to create an account with a simple onboarding. Upon connecting, the app looks through the groups (and pages coming soon) they belong to which feature VR content.  The content is indexed and tagged using image recognition to better understand user preferences. After selecting the content groups and categories which are most interesting to them, they can start their VR journey with a non-stop feed of live and video-on-demand content.  The app detects the user&rsquo;s language by their voice and translates the video content into their native language while also providing subtitles for the hearing impaired.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Consumers - These are the end beneficiaries of who will be consuming the VR content. It could be children in hospitals, persons with disabilities, victims of crises, kids in schools, adults learning new skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creators - these are the people who are creating 360 VR content to be consumed on the platform. Examples include teachers, caretakers, architects, enterprising young artists, trainers, and caretakers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Curators - these are people who may create an layer of organization or curation over VR content to provide more meaning, context or certification. These would likely be partner organizations who want to create curriculums to complete a series of VR experience and gauge the retention and success. Examples of these stakeholders are schools, cities, disaster relief orgs, hospitals, therapists, and private companies.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a team of 9 who quickly fell into natural roles. Many of which fell into familiar roles, and some fell into roles which challenged them with solving new problems.  The product team worked together to provide a rough overview of functionality with some light wireframes. The dev team did an architectural break down of the platforms we&rsquo;d have to use and the resources we&rsquo;d need to build it out. They identified what we could agree was our MVP, and we identified a number of stretch goals. We had a good idea of the technologies we wanted to use, but not all of them worked out. We had a great split of work committed to the back-end, front-end, and special projects (like AI &amp; language processing). We got on a roughly 3-5 hour sprint schedule and had regular check-ins with the entire team to talk about successes, address blockers, prioritize features and to re-allocate resources in order to move on. We used almost the entire ~46 hours of the hackathon to continue to build.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had a number of technical challenges in which we had to seek out mentorship from the supporting Facebook developer team. There were a lot of technologies we explored and wanted to utilize but felt that we had to pivot. The technologies we looked into but didn&rsquo;t use were PyTorch, React360, AWS Sagemaker, Messenger, Wit.ai. Aside from the usual technical challenges, we also faced challenges with app permissions. Understanding that we can't get certain permissions for public page content and group content approved in a short timeline, we were limited to just pull content from groups we created and are the administrators of.

                        Lack of infrastructure in the developing world and post-crisis. Don&rsquo;t expect VR headsets can get deployed everywhere, or that there is any guarantee of connectivity or even power.

                    <li>
                        Train the trainer and secondarily, incentivize the trainer. This helps to localize messages and content for those who are culturally far different than what we know as the world we live in. People from other cultures will respond better to content product or curated by people who are more like them. If you can find a way to incentivize the trainers, you can get a network of people who are not only creating content, but also producing or localizing it and teaching others how to consume it.

                    <li>
                        Lack of a single source of immersive VR content for anyone anywhere. While YouTube may enjoy an advantage as a &lsquo;discovery-first&rsquo; platform for video content, and Twitch for live esports and gaming content, Facebook with Oculus is the clear frontrunner to be the go-to content aggregator for VR content. While the discovery of VR content on Facebook isn&rsquo;t as natural as those we have talked to would like it, we are hoping to encourage the contribution of VR content to Facebook, while being able to curate consumption and discovery of it to users everywhere.

                        Focus in one area before we try to boil the ocean. Focusing on supporting an existing partner like Wishplay in the category of health &amp; wellness with education as a natural next step.

                <p>
                    After an amazing hackathon working together, the team wishes to keep the project moving along, understanding this truly could be a v0.1 for a truly functional product. Feedback from mentors was encouraging to say that there is a future and a market for this product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will continue on to build out our website and try to gauge interest from third parties across many different industries who are interested to partner up to try the platform. If interested and traction are encouraging, we will incorporate and make the fundraising rounds.  We have come to understand that it will likely be important for us to focus on a lane rather than trying to accommodate many industries and use cases at once. So it&rsquo;s most likely to first address Health &amp; Wellness or Education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we feel that we accomplished an amazing amount of functionality, we have a long list of stretch goals we&rsquo;d like to accomplish. We feel we already have a road map to sustain another year of development and improvement.
