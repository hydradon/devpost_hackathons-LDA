                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were sitting for two hours until we realized that we had no other ideas, so we went with this little project in order to try to help our fraternity automate some tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organizes announcements, recruitment, chores, dues, and members into a GUI that is all stored within a MySQL database. You can add and remove things from the database through the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, and tears. Also, MySQL, Java, and JDBC with Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MySQL formatting was a challenge, as well as linking all our functions to the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually building a system that connects to the database and correctly deals with all the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned better coding practices, and I should've started testing much earlier. Planning ahead to make all our functions work with the GUI would've also been helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fraternity Management
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to continue going with this software in order to actually help our fraternity organize some of our odds and ends, since we don't really have any dedicated software for this kind of thing, except for using spreadsheets. We also thought this software would be more useful as a phone application, so we may look into that type of integration.
