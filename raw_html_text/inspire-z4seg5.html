                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this app after seeing many problems in the real world. We wanted to develop a unique and simple way to stop online harassment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides motivational quotes and phrases, has a message board/forum to talk about issues, and a funny page to cheer you up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and eclipse to prototype and create a storyboard for our app. After storyboarding, we coded to add some of the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had lots of experience with android programming, so we had to learn it on the spot. It was time-consuming, but we eventually figured enough of it out to build a basic app in one night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to make a semi-complete app in one night, or at least a prototype that shows the basic functionality we wanted to achieve. This was not very easy, so that is an accomplishment we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of android programming and figured out how to deploy a real app in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inspire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a functioning database for the quotes and forum, so that our app will not get repetitive and boring over time. Also, we want to develop a sleeker and cleaner look so that we could attract more users. Eventually, we would like to develop an iOS app.
