                    The Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life as a developer is tough &ndash; who doesn&rsquo;t know the problem: after a long day at work you&rsquo;re coming home and you promised your girlfriend you would cook something tonight.
Time is short and you didn&rsquo;t had time to think about what you would like to cook. At home you look into your fridge and you find some leftovers - you know there is some paprika left and some chicken - and where there not as well some potatoes in the compartment?
Writing the most creative code is not a problem at all for you, but creative in cooking &ndash; let&rsquo;s look at your mom&rsquo;s cookbook to find a recipe &ndash; after a couple of minutes you give up, annoyed by finding recipe!
Here comes HelloFridge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With HelloFridge you can scan all your ingredients  with your IOS device &ndash; it will recognize which left overs you can use for which recipe and will give you a suggestion what you can cook. Happy end &ndash; your girlfriend is impressed &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to take her out to dinner and also important you could use your left overs from the last time  - at the same time it could be that HelloFridge is creating a shopping list about things that you could need for the next days and is sharing it with online grocery stores &ndash; you only have to click on the Order button and everything will be delivered on the next day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HelloFridge-App utilizes a simple three-step-process:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Scanning
2) Recognizing
3) Suggesting
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trained our object recognition algorithm with 15.000 labelled images, out of which we labelled 4.000 ourselfes in the last 24 hours. It works like teaching a child how the world works: You point with your finger at something, and tell him what it is and what it can do. Out of this data we&rsquo;re able to detect fast and reliable what ingredients are left in your kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app scans the world through the lens of your smartphone-camera, and detects your ingredients without you having to take photos of it. You get an instant feedback on your camera view and a list of ingredients without klicking not even one single button. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re only three swipes away from a recipe that fits your ingredients.
