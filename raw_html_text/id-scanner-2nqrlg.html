                    One of the team members recently had a problem with his faded ID card image when he went back to his home country so we wanted to solve the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It digitizes the ID card pictures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity engine with the Vuforia extension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to get Vuforia to properly display the image.
