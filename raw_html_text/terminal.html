                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy making games, and we wanted a deeper level of teamwork. We thought that adding "coding" into the game would make it even better.

                <p>
                    Terminal is a two person co-op game that relies on a user input from the keyboard and a joystick controller. By working together they can can pass through multiple levels

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Lua using the Love 2D engine

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was one of the biggest challenges we faced over this hackathon, having only 36 hours to develop a game, required teamwork from all aspects of our group. From our art designer to music and our programmers we worked around the clock to make sure that the game was functional and fun.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playable game that has currently two levels to play through. The teamwork and knowledge we gained through multitasking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management and communication were key to making sure that all factors of the game were being considered. Especially for the programmers when pushing their code individually to the master git branch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Terminal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely more levels, more commands, and we would furthermore continue making graphical and musical improvements.
