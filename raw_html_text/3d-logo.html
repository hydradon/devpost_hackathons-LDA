                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really liked the SoHacks logo and looked for ways I could further improve it, and then I came up with the idea of making a 3D model that's ready for 3D Printing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can also be used for 3D printing or laser cutting/etching the logo. I estimate it'll take about 3-4 hours to finish printing the model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used OnShape over the course of about 7-8 hours to innovate the logo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just happy that I finished the logo, it wasn't very easy at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to recreate logos in OnShape and learned from the many mistakes I made on my journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Logo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm looking forward to 3D printing this in the future, it should come out nicely!
