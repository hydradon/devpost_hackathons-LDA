                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many UC's have pledged to be carbon neutral by a certain date. Our members have a passion for sustainable design and want to help the community and the world far in the future. We wanted to make it for any community member who wanted to see the average energy outputs for a building. We also made it as a very quick tool for Facilities Management at Davis to use to target upgrades and revamping of certain building in insulation and other optimizing.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes the thermodynamic data from OSIsoft; the amount of electricity, heat, and AC in kBTU, the outdoor temperature in Rankines, all versus time, taken at 2 minute intervals. We had access to two years of data and averaged it across the two years and then the seasons to allow the user to see the energy consumption for a specific season and specific type of building, like lab or community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using sublime with a python compiler. We utilized the kivy module to create a GUI compatible with app development. We also utilized the data given to us from OSIsoft with the help from the jupyter notebook they gave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble making an idea to start coding for. We are not CS majors and have relatively small experience. Learning how to use kivy was challenging as it wasn't very intuitive and took up a lot of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to learn more coding and survive our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use kivy and more ways to extract data using pandas.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Hello, world
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to use this experience as a learning lesson and push ourselves to learn more and be innovative.
