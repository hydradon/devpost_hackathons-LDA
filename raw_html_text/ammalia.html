                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By attending the Health Panel held at TreeHacks, we had the opportunity to listen and better understand the needs of the health industry. Afterwards, we consulted with a surgeon, who mentioned that while scrubbed in and sterile in the operating room, it is very important to reference the scans containing important details relating to the surgical operation to avoid any mishaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ammalia is a Leap Motion assisted app that allows medical professionals to easily view and manipulate scans while scrubbed in, sterile and ready to perform a surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion controller tracks the professionals hands using infrared cameras, motions such as swipe, grab and pinch were some of the movements integrated in our application. Authentication and database storage are made possible by using the Dropbox API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Primary use cases
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in &amp; sterile in the OR.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Working with the Leap Motion API was difficult since a limited number of our team members has experience with JS and front-end development in general.

                    <li>
                        The gestures are very mathematically dependent so programming and calibrating the sensor was difficult to perfect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had to utilize the help of the mentors available to us to get the Dropbox API to work correctly but we were able to get it working eventually.

                <p>
                    Ammalia has endless possibilities as it can be applied to various industries including medical, engineering, mining, etc..
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase different health record data points that pertain to the patient being showcased (i.e. name, age, background, etc).
