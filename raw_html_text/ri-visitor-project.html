                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many visitors to Raffles Institution (RI) often felt that the registration process was lengthy and annoying. They often had to get out of the car and hand over their IC in return for a visitor's pass. This could cause extra confusion as they may forget to return the pass, and safety concerns arise as the security guards have control over the visitors' IC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 2 parts to this project, contained in the /ri and /pre folders in the repo, respectively. The /ri portion registers visitors who turn up directly at RI. It reads their IC barcode and gives a QR code which can be printed out. The /pre portion is for pre-registration of visitors. Right now, the two parts are not linked, but they will be in the future.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the /ri portion we used Flask to serve the app, as well as HTML, CSS, and a
                    <strong>
                        lot
                    </strong>
                    of painful JavaScript. Libraries we used include QuaggaJS (for barcode reading), SQLAlchemy (for storage of particulars), and PyQRCode (for QR code generation).
For the /pre portion, we built it completely out of HTML, CSS and JS with no external scripts. Backend has not been implemented yet.

                <p>
                    We can't count with all our 6 hands the number of times our Javascript broke.

                    Don't give up. It's always worth feeling good when your code suddenly works.
