                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came from an anime character who programs an AI automatic email reply bot called maid-chan which then becomes more and more advanced. I wanted to create an AI that can interact with the user and hopefully combat loneliness and depression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, our version of maid-chan can load different animations and hold a conversation with a user as well as translating it's outputs to speech using text to speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GUI was built using Java Swing and using the wizard Window Builder. 
Text to Speech was built using external libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems arose trying to install modules for python to use text to speech as the module that was being used had actually been deprecated.
Did not have a graphics tablet to draw our own art. Had to use gifs off of the internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text to speech works well
GUI has a nice aesthetic and the layout of the windows are well structured and designed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to convert text to speech.
How to design a well structured and aesthetically pleasing GUI.
How to get the number of screens that a person is using and how to find the length of the toolbar and appropriately align the windows so that it is in the bottom right corner resting above the toolbar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Maid Chan - Waifu Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of a menu to allow for selection of chatting.
Implementation of self learning AI to allow for more varied chatting (see replika for more info).
Allow Maid Chan to access emails and social media and store them all in a local area so that it is easier to find important information and talk easier to people. (Try to combine all social media messages into one user interface)
More interactivity with the user - i.e. use mouse to give headpats etc.
Add a jealousy meter so that maid chan can act jealous when reading emails etc. (changes interaction with user)
Add existential crises to character to make her seem more real and break fourth walls.
Add more idle animations and other animations - and use  a rng to determine which animations show at which time based on formulas and circumstances.
Add a progress bar for when the application is loading
Combine all three windows into one icon.
Tweak the design slightly.
