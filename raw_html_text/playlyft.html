                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no better way to discover live music than to live it yourself. However, finding live events and planning your way between them completely distracts from the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playlyft scours live events in your area for you and generates an itinerary allowing you to navigate through the night and experience local talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as Playlyft is opened, a customized schedule for the evening is generated that highlights the artists to see with travel times between the venues pre-planned for you.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a hybrid mobile (android) app using Ionic with a serverless architecture built on Amazon Web Services in the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a city like Austin there is a lot of data available to sift through. One of our challenges and our greatest value proposition is being able to sift through the data and create a night that completely satisfies the user's musical taste and preferences.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the work we have in crunching data for a big event like SXSW which has a lot of data available
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about using AWS API gateway and AWS Lambda as well as using ionic framework and deeplinking with Lyft.
