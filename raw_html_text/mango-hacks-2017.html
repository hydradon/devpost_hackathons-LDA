                    The project for the Mango Hacks 2017 hackathon held at Florida International University from Febuary 24, 2017 - Febuary 26, 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is to use a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, an LED strip, and the IBM Watson API to take the lyrics of a song
and display it's 'mood' on an LED strip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project's overlying theme is the ability to mark any song with a wholly unique color, specific to that song. The color would not be chosen by random choice, but instead be generated through the examination of the tonal mood found within the song itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project incorporates various aspects of the IBM Bluemix platform to meet this goal. Node-RED is used to interface the twitter API with the CloudantDB to store specific tweets of interest to the project. Furthermore the IBM Data and Analytics tool for Twitter Insights is used to examine a set of specific tweets for a certain criteria. Lastly our project demanded for the examination of blocks of text for the under-lying emotional meaning. We used the IBM Watson tone analyzer to examine large bodies of text to achieve this goal. With the tone and mood of the lyrics established we can then communicate through the raspberry pi, to an Arduino to flash an RGBLED strip to the color of the music. To have multiple inputs we set up the amazon echo using the IFTTT interface we set up the ability for Alexa to write to a drop box file. This allowed use to have a text file of what the person said which allowed us to find the lyrics and ask Watson for the analysis to show the RGBLED strip color.
