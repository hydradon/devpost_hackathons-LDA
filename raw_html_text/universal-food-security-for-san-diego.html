                    I had a prior commitment and will not be able to attend but have submitted some initial information to stay in the program for now.  The idea was inspired by an interview County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher gave during the campaign about underutilization of the SNAP program and how its expansion would be the quickest and most direct way to address the issue while bringing about $800 million into the regional economy each year.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Universal Food Security for San Diego
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to explore more deeply the disparity between the record unemployment happening seemingly at the same time as an increase in poverty and food insecurity to see if there are flaws in our data or assumptions.  I am particularly interested in people who may fall into this situation to see if that can be forestalled.  I don't think it is a good idea to define the problem until it is well understood or to propose solutions prematurely.
