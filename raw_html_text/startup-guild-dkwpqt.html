                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by our work at startups.We needed a tool to stay motivated and organized at the same time .So we developed a game ... Well not really a game , but with the feel of it , a guild!
We're team 42 , so it's not hard to get inspired .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a platform that is aimed towards start-ups and smaller companies who work in the IT industry. The platform is a hybrid for those who love gaming, but still want, and have to get their jobs done. On this platform, teams will be able to easily set up work distribution by giving out quests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using our best knowledge of the frameworks we usually work on . Two of us had done the front-end part and one has done the back-end . We had designed everything from scratch,   with the help of some design mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenge was to finish this web app in time for presentation . But we ran into other challenges like loosing time thinking about the design or brainstorming new ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud because we finished and deployed the app in time .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop a better teamwork , and gained some new coding skills .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Startup Guild
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a start, we will use it  for our own purposes ,because we are a part of a startup too ,  and maybe in time we can host a complete version and make our web app accessible for everyone .
