                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our friend Alessio's failed attempts at using tinder to get a date, we knew there had to be a better way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application lets you find dates and suggests a dating venue based on both of your common interests. It uses the Google Distance Matrix to find the distance between you and another potential suitor. Once you've found a match, we use the Google Places API to find possible date locations within proximity of both of you. You can then choose one of these dates, and the other person can either decline or accept it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Kivy to create the various screens throughout the application. We then tied in events from Kivy with the various Google API's to display all of the information to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us came in with only python experience. In order to make this project work, we had to learn Kivy, Buildozer, Google API's, mongoDB and several other tools. Kivy and its particular Widgets were particularly difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully integrating the Google API's with the application and having algorithms that properly formatted data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides all of the technical stuff, we learned how to integrate each others work into a cohesive, functioning product
