                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as I saw the leap motion on the hardware list, I knew I wanted to combine it with VR in some way. I thought it would be cool to use your hands to perform actions in a game like shooting a fireball or an Iron Man blast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It places the user in a sandbox setting where they can play around with supernatural powers using the motions and gestures of their hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used leap motion's orion sdk to connect the motion to the oculus rift. Unity was the game engine to bring the scene together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leap motion's documentation was challenging to follow, but I eventually found out there was a module that could greatly help me.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though it isn't much, the first time I got the laser to shoot as a result of pointing a finger or opening your hand out was pretty

                    I'm looking to add more controls for movement, abilities, etc
