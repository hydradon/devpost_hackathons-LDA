                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We acknowledged how most financial institutions assume a certain level of knowledge before providing options. We wanted to create a platform where people could find out what choice was best for them while simultaneously learning about money and the choices out there at a fundamental level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform takes a short survey to determine what kind of beginner the user is, and then recommends various options for their needs. There is also a learning and testing tool on the various terms and options available to give the users the resources they need to make informed decisions.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css, and javascript to create the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all beginners and have very minimal experience with coding so each step required a lot of learning. We had an ambitious idea and were unable to complete all the tasks we had scheduled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot today and were able to see the applications of our knowledge in the webpage we made! We had to troubleshoot at almost every step but figured out a lot of things on our own and were able to see our vision come to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about the software we used and also learned more about how coding works, and how specific each one must be in order to achieve success.
                </p>

                    What's next for Finquire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have lots of different ideas on how to tailor this to each individual user. There are opportunities to teach a great deal of different terms and opportunities to beginners, as well as integrate new features and partnerships.
