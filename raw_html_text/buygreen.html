                    In today&rsquo;s modern world, most people are willing and able to go green, but are oftentimes uninformed on how to do so. Furthermore, people who do go green need a method to quantify one&rsquo;s personal impact and determine the physical impact on environment for each green decision. To solve this, our application offers a gamified incentive to go green by tracking shopping purchases and rating the product based on its carbon footprint. This application will have a social aspect in order to allow users to share and compete with their friends and local community. In addition to motivating consumers, product manufacturers will be more incentivized to make greener products to reach the environmentally conscious consumer.
