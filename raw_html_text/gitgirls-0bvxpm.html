                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team formed by our shared passion for education and web development.

                    GitGirls is webpage all about educating and introducing beginner female programmers into the ever-changing tech world. Users are able to create and customize their public profile, connect and network with other women in tech, share projects, and collaborate with others.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to code the front end part of the website. We started to use the AWS server and finish the backend using PHP but due to time constraints we decided to focus on the idea and the message about community more so we created our web pages with vibrant visuals created using illustrator and photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are all beginner developers and designers, we had many issues along the way that we learned from. The biggest issue we had was working with the time constraint. We had to ask many mentors about our questions with servers and other problems we came across.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are just extremely proud to be able to form a team out of strangers, complete a project in such a short amount of time and have a blast doing it, especially since we are all new to hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would help for future hackathons to understand some concepts better beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GitGirls
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love hackathons! Attend more, learn as much as we can, and create as much as we can.
