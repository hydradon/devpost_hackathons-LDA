                    Inspiration When we walked into this hackathon, we knew nothing about coding-literally nothing. We didnt know coding languages and we had never even hear the term "Xcode". But this hackathon literally opened new doors for us. We went from knowing nothing to knowing how to somewhat create an app. But what really inspired us? This hackathon. We were told to find some social issues. We recognized the lack of blood donation as an important problem in our society. This issue was especially important to us because during this time, my teammate's grandfather was having surgery in India, where blood donation are extremely important, but blood donation are dwindling. For this reason, we were inspired to code an app about blood donation.

                <h2>
                    What it does This app essentially connects people and hospitals and makes it easier for hospitals to get certain blood types that are needed. Hospitals are able to request the blood type and amount they need, and donors are able to easily locate nearby blood donation centers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We used Xcode to build to app. There were many challenges as this was our first time using this program and using the programing language Swift, but we eventually were able to successfully code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into We run into many errors while writing the code. This took a long time to deal with because Swift didn't locate the error, so we had to manually recheck our code to look for errors. We ran into many signal SIGABRTs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of our design, as well as our ability to create this app without previous knowledge about coding.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned We learned many things about the basics of coding and app development. We are extremely grateful for this opportunity because we now know how to code in Xcode.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for B-Positive We want to take the app to full-scale, fully develop the interactive map, and with lot of development, we hope to one day make it available for hospitals to use.
