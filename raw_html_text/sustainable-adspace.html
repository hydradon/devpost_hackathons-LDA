                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What annoys everyone, universally. How can we take that and make it better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reroutes ads towards sustainable organizations ads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Pihole, an open source local network ad eraser, and modified parts of it's code so it would redirect ads rather than erase them. The redirection takes it to ad templates that we created.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    The raspberry pi we have had to be held onto during coding.

                <p>
                    Fun project,  creative idea, and it was the first time working with hardware for myself.

                    What's next for Sustainable AdSpace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To try and develop it into a "plug and play" system, that can be then presented to sustainable organizations to give as giveaways in returns for donations, adding the overall benefit.
