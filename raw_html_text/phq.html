                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every student is aware of the frustratingly long wait times at mental-health services provided by universities and even other organizations. This is not okay and we believe innovations in technology can help automate a lot of the processes that increase wait-times. Hear Me Now is one of the steps in that direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hear Me Now aims to provide the first step to help those that might be feeling down or depressed. Those in need can talk to Alexa about how they have been feeling and then a report is generated and emailed to the person's local psychiatrist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the complete voice workflow in Voiceflow with integrations with Google Sheets API and Zappier for integrations with Google Docs API and Gmail API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were first time users of Voiceflow and didn't have much experience working with APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we were successfully able to produce a product that works on our Alexa Dot and works seamlessly with all the integrated APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not only how to create software but also learned to create products with the end-user in mind. We gained more experience working in domains in which we hadn't worked before such as creating voice-based apps and using APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hear Me Now
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe Hear Me Now is the first step to a much bigger puzzle. To that end, we wish to create a bot that learns to better understand its user and provides appropriate help.
