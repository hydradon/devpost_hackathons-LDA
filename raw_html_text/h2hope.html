                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays a map that shows the level of influence of different variables on shark migration patterns.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MEAN stack with Mapbox.JS to show the visualization with data parsed with Python and stored in MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working with enormous data sets, causing queries to take minutes to run and laptops to freeze.  Mapbox.JS also had useful functions but difficult-to-understand examples that required extra attention to integrate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end with AngularJS and HTML5 is beautifully organized, with background videos on every page. While difficult, finding and working with the huge amounts of data definitely gave us a perspective on what kinds of constraints data engineers deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with big datasets and workarounds for sprawling projects. And plenty of Git tips and problems.
                </p>

                    What's next for H2Hope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all the tools into the backend and using the newly understood data to make actual predictive models for migration.
