                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever had a day, where you're waiting for hours and hours for a single queue! Welcome Queue Planner a smart scheduler that will automatically queue you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives suggestions to your schedule and checks your schedule with other's bookings to give an optimal schedule for you. It then allows you to book your schedule with all the places mentioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app and the server was built with HTML, CSS, JQuery, NodeJS, MySQL, and Javascript. We built the mobile app with Swift!.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with the Booking Algorithm because the algorithm would have to take into account not just your own schedule, but the schedule of the location, and of other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully made a small demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to do HTML, CSS, and Javascript to work on the server and web app!
SQL is tiresome.

                    We would like to improve the queuing and booking system!
