                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to gain experience with the raspberry pi controlling something robotic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It accepts messages from a Slack group chat in order to execute routines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A raspberry pi is controlling the two-wheeled car. We used the Slack API to parse through messages and find keywords which will direct the car however is determined by its users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing through Slack's cryptic data structures surrounding its messages!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parsed through Slack's cryptic data structures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant more about Python, electrical wiring, the power of raspberry pis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text-to-Drive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to hook a camera up to the car and stream it onto a monitor. This could allow for it to be controlled in another room, with a goal is of making it touch a certain object
