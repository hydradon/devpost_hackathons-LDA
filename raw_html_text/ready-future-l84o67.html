                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the development of urbanization we have seen the increase in technology, while most people may see this as a benefit in terms of communication, it can cause people to feel more isolated than before. Many people take for granted the use of social media however, there are those who have abused their power. This harm has caused a great amount of stress and mental health issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program allows the user to express themselves with their thoughts and feelings, the program uses a natural language processor to depict the mood of the user. The computer has the capability to predict weather the user is happy, sad or even depressed. In addition, the website will give feedback as to how they can improve their mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using html, css, and javascript. For javascript we used the sentimood.js library to make it better for the client and user to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we encountered when creating our project was implementing the API into our code. This was a challenge as we were dealing with large amounts of information and that was repetitively complicated in terms of the inputs and the outputs needed for the machine learning. Another challenge we faced was the implantation of payment. At first, we wanted to implement a flat rate of $1.99 per month with the use of Authorize.net However, we came to realize this did not correspond with our object of a cheap solution to mental health issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we created a cheap solution that helps one's mental health. We wanted to eliminate the high cost of psychologist, in order to sustain the middle and low class.  We believe that mental health is a very important issue that is prevalent in our society however, not many people talk about and are oblivious of the term. So being able to make a free and private solution in order to help one;s mental health is something, we as a group, are very proud of.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest things we learned, was machine learning specifically natural language processing. This one a skill we needed to use in order to effectively implement the database of information we found online. This was the first time any one of us dealt with machine learning and we were successful at implementing NLU. This process allowed us to hone our skills because of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ready Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could like to implement social media API's this will allow us to gain insight to the general mental state of the user. As it will be easier to get a more accurate representation of ones mental state as we get more information about the user.
