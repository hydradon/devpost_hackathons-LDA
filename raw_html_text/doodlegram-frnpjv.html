                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be cool to create a program where I could make pictures just using voice commands.  I imagined many possibilities including creating galleries and ways to send the pictures, leading to the name Doodlegram.  I aimed the initial version for kids, entering it in the Alexa Kids challenge, but avoided any phone or data collection.  I was contacted by Amazon with suggestions that I add ISP elements, and when I saw the ISP competition, I decided to rewrite the code so I could send the pictures by MMS.  ISP would allow me to cover the MMS charges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about making Consumable products for Alexa ISP, as I had only done subscriptions before.  I also learned about how SVG works and the Amazon version AVG, rewriting the previous code to take advantage of that new addition to the APL.  I learned the libraries needed for image conversion in Python, and worked on Layer creation in AWS Lambda so I could keep my code size low enough to keep using the inline editor there.
