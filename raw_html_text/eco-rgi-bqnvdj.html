                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to play a part in creating software that enables sustainable consumption for daily users. Inspired by our own consumption patterns, we aim to promote and inspire lower carbon footprint for millennials like ourselves.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short, it is a "One-Stop-Shop" for sustainable consumers, a chrome extension that recommends sustainable alternatives across multi e-commerce platform (Ebay, Amazon, etc.) for items purchased digitally. To incentives consumers, we made a ranking system (Level 0-10) that provides up to 10% cash-back (0%-10% discount depending on their level) for the purchase of the more sustainable alternative made possible with affiliate marketing. To make things simple, we utilized Blockstack to store, verify and encrypt consumer's e-commerce account information for quicker login across platforms, and easier adoption.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We built it with AMEE Connect API that provides us with the metric on carbon emission for items sold digitally, this allows us to have a basis of comparison when trying to come up with recommendations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To be able to pull recommended item information across platforms to be displayed to consumers as a more sustainable alternative, we utilized APIs from e-commerce platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To create our ecosystem, we utilized Blockstack's API that enabled us to store, verify and encrypt consumer's e-commerce account information for quicker login when making purchases.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We ran into compatibility issues when we tried to use Blockstack for chrome extension. We also face difficulty understanding various APIs within a short span of time.
