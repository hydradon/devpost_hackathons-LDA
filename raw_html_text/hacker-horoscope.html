                </h2>
                <p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used java code with a scanner we created ways to make the correct horoscope to appear.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know what the horoscopes were and  we wanted the judges to get the most authentic experience.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that we should keep the code simple so that it does not create any problems for the user and at the same time does not create any tough problems for the developers to deal with it.
