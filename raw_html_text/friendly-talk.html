                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an introvert, and I have hard times talking with people. I really want to talk with people on the bus, but I am really shy most of the time. Therefore, I built this app as a way for strangers to talk with each other in close area like buses, restaurants, ...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses  your location and people's location that might be close to you to create a list view. The list is updated every five seconds. You can chat with the person who are 0.5 miles near you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Sinch API for verification and Firebase for database
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    This is my first project in Swift and iOS, so I spent quite amount of time fixing bugs. Also, rules in Firebase is also a pain.
