                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something which was known to be a challenging problem, and solve it with the cutting edge tools provided for us. We decided to tackle the difficult problem of computational finance and machine learning based stochastic forecasting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A UI which assists users in investing decision by providing stock forecast based on big data mined from Twitter Feeds, New York Times, and Yahoo Finance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure ML to build an Artificial Neural Network regression algorithm. The web app was built with python, flask, html5, jquery, and chart.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure ML Training and API challenges were encountered. Azure ML training took a good 8 hours on complex models and the API was difficult to work with at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sheer accuracy of our machine learning algorithm and the beautifully simple design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stochastic nature of the stock market is difficult to model with machine learning based regression algorithms.
                </p>

                    What's next for StockBrief
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to build a hedge fund with our new algorithm.
