                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to promote competition in lecture attendance, allowing students to reach greater heights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imports timetable from an iCal file and displays it, as well as opportunity to add and delete events in the event lectures are cancelled. Will have point tracked before 12.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Android Studio using Java, with Biweekly library used for importing and parsing iCal data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered many challenges due to our lack of prior experience in anything software related, having been limited in C and C++ in an embedded context. This was also our first ever Hackathon, and very few of us were here for the full time. We had never done any work with Java, databases, android, app development, or hosted software in general. Almost all skills applied were learnt while coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Happy we managed to find our way around Android Studio and learn bits of Java, having no idea how either worked beforehand, as well as creating basic databases using recommended Android APIs. Functioned okay on no sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learnt some Java programming, how to use Android, basic concepts of databases, many important lessons about project planning and design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lecture Login
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aim to refine features and add the main parts of our app, such as GPS check-in. Ended up spending most of our time familiarising ourselves with the development software and many concepts we hadn't encountered before, as a group of only electronic engineers.
