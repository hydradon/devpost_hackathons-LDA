                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the recent 2016 election we've seen a lot of comments and posts about politics. While it's good to stay informed, a lot of these posts are filled with misinformation, hatred, and nonsense. Eventually, enough is enough and you may want to take out some, or all, of the politics from your Facebook experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Google Chrome extension filters out political posts by removing them from your feed as you scroll. Whether you're on your news feed, a friends page, a group, or any other feed, the related posts will disappear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built with a lot of help from mentors from our University, using Google documentation on how to create a Chrome extension. We don't have a lot of HTML, just to make our preferences. All of our logic was done in Javascript without any frameworks. There were times it would've probably been easier to use jQuery, but we decided it'd be good to practice our Javascript and keep it straight forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into more challenges than anticipated. Here's a few of them;
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Our biggest challenge was connecting our options menu to our javascript.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We couldn't filter comments out, sometimes it just isn't necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It took us a while to find out how to target Facebook posts because posts in different areas usually have different classes, and IDs are constantly changing.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Considering our experience level, we're extremely proud we have a working product we can demo that we made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not only was our experience in Javascript minimal, but we'd never even looked up the documentation for making an extension until hacking started. Which is also why we're so proud of our accomplishment.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We learned how to put together a chrome extension.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned tons of Javascript we'd never worked with.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As usual, always learning more about git.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    We'd like to provide our users with different kinds of data. For example, how many daily posts are hidden, total posts ever hidden, whose posts are most often hidden, etc.
