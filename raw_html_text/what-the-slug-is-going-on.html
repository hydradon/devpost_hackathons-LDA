                <p>
                    As Freshman, we really enjoyed being able to use apps like Guidebook to help us navigate what events were happening during Welcome Week. Guidebook was an app that listed all events throughout the college in various forms, such as a map form based on the events' proximity to the user and dorm. Since the first week of school, however, its been a lot harder to find fun things to do with our time, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. This is our solution.

                    creates an environment where UC Santa Cruz students can post new school events or outside events, such as concerts at the Catalyst , midnight movies at the Del Mar, or parties(whether they be in a house or in the forest) and share them openly with the rest of the Slugs on campus. It is more personalized in how more popular events will appear higher on the event list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        JavaScript
                    </strong>
                    to build the front end and some
                    <strong>
                        Java
                    </strong>
                    to save input in the backend. We then utilized
                    <strong>
                        Firebase
                    </strong>
                    for the login and
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud SQL
                    </strong>
                    to run a database full of information for events - name, date, time, location, likes, dislikes - all to help create a more organized interface and easily manage the information related to each event..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were getting "500 Server Errors" when submitting new details for events(issue with
                    <strong>
                        Google Cloud SQL
                    </strong>
                    ). After plenty of debugging and messing around with our code, issues continued to persist. The libraries that were being used locally were not initially being pushed to the App Engine, resulting in errors when methods that required those libraries were being used. Ultimately, a unique exception was being thrown (still resulting in HTTP 500 errors) that did not have any results on Google for. At this point, we switched from using the database to an alternate data store.

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of

                <p>
                    We're really proud of our use of Google API (Maps, Buttons).

                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Google interfaces are actually really easy to implement into our of website, but if the code that runs the database is done incorrectly, you're website will run into a lot of issues. We also learned that using one cloud service works relatively easily, but the moment you try and combine multiple cloud solutions, the lack of synergy between the platforms is evident and requires a lot of time to debug.

                    </strong>
                    The real difficulty came with debugging issues with our database. The website looks pretty official, but at the moment it definitely has some server problems.

                    </strong>
                    We believe that this could really change the way people have fun at Santa Cruz. Big events can be even bigger with our hack. Yes, we've started small with only Santa Cruz students, but if successful, the same could be replicated for other college campuses.

                    </strong>
                    No, its not. There are issues with the domain and server that when resolved, should make for an easy user experience. The website is quite explanatory and simple to use.
