                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We founded a gamedev club at our school, and for our club we gave the students the task of creating a tower defense game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A first person game where you play as a tank that can shoot at enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, we created the scripts written in C# for the game mechanics. This required an understanding of physics and math concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity has a ton of functions and quirks that for an inexperience team can easily hold them back, especially given time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self-made fully textured models, sound track, and base scripts that can now be used for many games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A higher understanding of Unity, and that particles are harder than they seem.
                </p>

                    What's next for Robodyne
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original concept was a tower defense game with multiple enemies, and being able to control multiple tanks as the towers. The tanks would have their own AI to shoot at enemies, but the player can control tanks indiviudally for more firepower.
