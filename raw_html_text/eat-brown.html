                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        As freshmen at Brown
                    </strong>
                    we found ourselves unsure how to navigate Brown's dining options.  While information is available on a website in a 2000's table-like fashion, it's hard to get to and not mobile friendly at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the launch of the new
                    <strong>
                        Brown API
                    </strong>
                    , we decided this would be a perfect time to create an
                    <strong>
                        all-inclusive Ratty and VDub app
                    </strong>
                    to allow students to easily check menu options on their phone.  We often find ourselves thinking
                    <em>
                        "is there any carrot cake at the VDub?"
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        "not pot roast jardiniere again!"
                    </em>
                    only after we get to the dining hall.  Now we can think that before we go in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With tabs for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which automatically go to the next meal based on time of day, and further controls to pick between Ratty and VDub, students can easily see all available dining options at the main dining halls.
