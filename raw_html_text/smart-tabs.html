                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I realized that as I work, I tend to open up a lot of tabs on Google Chrome. As I go through more and more links, I forget to clean up the old tabs, which clutters up my view and overall organization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created Smarter Tabs to do all of my organization for me. Smarter Tabs is a Chrome Extension that helps track how you are using your tabs and removes the one's that have been inactive for far too long. Smarter Tabs also keeps track of all the recently deleted tabs so that if you still need the information at your fingertips, you can easily access it through the form of links. By storing these tabs that have been inactive in the form of links, you can still access them but it is less resource intensive of your browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was actually my very first Chrome extension and I also had little experience with Javascript before so it really was an adventure. I poured through a lot of documentation about how everything goes in together and I also got help from mentors along the way, which was incredibly beneficial. This essentially tracks how long its been since a tab was last active and at the end of the timer, the tab will close, and its information will be saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into and What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much I ran into a lot of bugs haha. I would pass variables that were the wrong type into all sorts of functions and things just broke. I spent quite a bit of time through the console debugging. It was a jarring, yet rewarding experience.
I learned a lot through this project and I feel now with the power of Google search I can figure anything out! I wish to enhance the ways that Smarter Tabs detects usage and hopefully later, as time goes by, Smarter Tabs will learn more and more from the user so that the longer they use this extension, the more capable it will be of organizing their tabs.
