                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we had 36 hours on our hands, we decided this would be the perfect opportunity for our first VR project build. Escape rooms are becoming quite a popular phenomenon these days- a group of people are locked down in a controlled environment, making their way out on the foundation of clues and teamwork. We wanted to build a similar environment using 3D renderings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, we built a scavenger hunt environment- where one user is inside the virtual escape room and second user guides them with the set of clues they are provided with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Majority of the 3D world was built by us in Unreal Engine, integrated with Blueprints that tracks our movement captured by HTC Vive
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Due to the high benchmarks required by SteamVR, we only had one machine that we used the whole time for project development.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We constructed a 2 story building, but the bounds defined on both the floors kept interrupting with each other for the most part- teleporting us to undesired spots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unable to setup a Version Control for the project due to the size of the project
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2 CS major students- 1 Vive, 1 PC and no prior VR development experience.
                    </strong>
                    Yet being able to build a full 3D environment where we could accurately track movement was quite an achievement.
Being able to implement our own locked door-key system took quite a while, but is one of it's kind at the moment in VR development!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No matter how many languages you know, IDE's you use, lines of code you write; there's always room for learning more! We learned how complex the game engines are and how hard it is to implement even the simplest ideas in game dev!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ScavengerHuntVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more activities to make the duration of escape room last longer. Also, we would like to establish a live voice chat feature over ambient sounds in the game to make the expedience more elated.Overall, this project will help us greatly in building more VR applications.
