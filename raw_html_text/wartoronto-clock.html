                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever missed your 9am lectures because you keep hitting snooze on your alarm clock? Have you had trouble waking up in the morning or at night to study? Our project proposes an interesting and fun solution to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our alarm clock generates a series of patterns that you must complete in order to shut it off. Therefore it requires you to be fully awake in order to shut it off and would therefore make going back to sleep much more difficult and unlikely.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to code the software for the leap motion that would generate a random pattern using boolean variables. The user would have to make certain gestures which were predefined in a certain order to complete the pattern and shut the alarm off.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble trying to obtain a power source for a raspberry pi and in the end we could not implement the leap motion software with the raspberry pi. Therefore we resorted to using a laptop for the alarm clock.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to interact with the leap motion software and also got to experience setting up and using a raspberry pi for the first time as well as building breadboard circuits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to operate a lot of new hardware and learnt about leap motion.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Wateronto Clock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would find a way to integrate raspberry pi into our project and also connect a breadboard with LEDs and have a HEX display. We would also have a physical design for the clock and an option to physically set the time with buttons and also allow the user to choose a preset song to wake up to.
