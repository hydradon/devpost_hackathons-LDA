                        Shipping costs suck, and I want to fix that.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sale Split combines orders from the same college so students can combine their buying power and enjoy shipping discounts and sales together when they would not be able to individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built on HTML, CSS, Javascript on Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came to the party late, so I missed all the networking events. So I had to work by myself since everyone else already had a team by the time I got here. I have limited back-end knowledge, so I put in effort to make the front end scaffolding and design as useful as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am extremely proud of being able to crank out the front-end with the limited coding experience I have. My strong suit is actually in business and economics, and I only coded for fun on the side. Regardless, I am glad I learned all that I did about front-end development in my free time to be able to put this together. I am also happy with how much work I got done individually; I usually excel working in a team but this was a good change of pace, and it made me hustle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee is a powerful drug. Back-end development is tough, major props to those who are good at it. Creating something actually useful and good is hard, and requires much more effort and execution than just a good idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sale Split
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will look to receive funding to work with a developer and create a full working product and to market the initial launch. I will leverage my connections from Emory, Atlanta Tech Village, investors, and other colleges to market and roll out the future of e-commerce in a sharing economy starting from Emory and expanding to other colleges around the US and the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features-wise, Sale Split will necessarily incorporate a payment API like Stripe or Braintree to allow a complete online shopping flow with seamless and secure payment and shipping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sale Split will also expand to B2B to allow small business owners the ability to purchase at lower prices in bulk together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        In the future
                    </strong>
                    , I envision Sale Split to become a leading hybrid e-commerce and social network that will decrease market friction, increase inventory movement, and further bolster the sharing economy.
