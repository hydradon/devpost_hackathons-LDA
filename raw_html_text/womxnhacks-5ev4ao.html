                <h2>
                    This week our friend got in two bike accidents in the same day which could have both been easily prevented with safety technology.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our bike has 3 main functions.  One is a turn signal with buttons on the handle bars.  On the front of the bike, we have a small LCD screen that displays current speed in miles per hour.  There is also a ultrasonic sensor to detect when the biker is approaching another biker and is getting too close.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used an Arduino kit we had with a lot of sensors.  We connected all the speed data with an LCD screen, an ultrasonic sensor with LED's, and some Arduino buttons with more LED's for turn signals.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Because we came up with our idea so last minute, we did not have much time for major changes.  We were not prepared with all the supplies we needed, and some of the makeshift wire connections we made continued to go in and out, but in the end we made it work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we were most proud of on our bike is the speedometer.  We used an infrared beam and detector around the fork of our bike.  This is a feature we knew little to nothing about, but we did our research and made it work perfectly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned how to program in Arduino as well as working the hardware of the Arduino.  3 out of 4 of us had never used one before, so we applied skills from other projects and collaborated.  Our teamwork is a big accomplishment.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I see expansion for womxn/hacks and am excited for it to become an annual event.
