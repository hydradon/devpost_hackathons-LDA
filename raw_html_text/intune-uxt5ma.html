                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often associate music with certain feelings we cannot put into words, and memories that we may have thought we had forgotten. Music has a huge effect on our emotions and our minds, and research has even showed that significant songs have brought back traces of memories for patients with Alzheimer's. We wanted to create an application that could help track mental health and awareness, but at the same time, take it to a new level by incorporating music with it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon opening the application, the user is brought to a calendar like home screen, where each colored square represents a filled in journal entry for the day. The user can create journal entries by clicking on any date in the calendar, bringing them to a screen where they can choose a song for the day, significant lyrics from the song, and write a short journal entry. After selecting the lyrics of choice, the application performs sentiment analysis on the lyrics to determine the user's overall mood for the day, and colors the square on the calendar accordingly (something that can also be set by the user). A completed entry would contain the song of the day, its album art, a sample recording, the significant lyrics, and the user's typed entry.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to create a native iOS application, as well as the iTunes API to access songs, the Musixmatch API to generate lyrics, and the Google Cloud Natural Language API for sentiment analysis.
