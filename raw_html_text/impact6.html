                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of food, clothes, etc... is wasted everyday. A lot of times, people may not know about the different organizations that accept these items to distribute to the less fortunate in their areas. That is exactly what our website is designed to do. It is a discovery platform as well for not for non profit organizations that are new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website grabs the users location and then searches around for locations within a certain radius where he or she can donate. The website also offers non profits to enter their information into the system so they can be discovered if someone searches for a location in their area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website has been built using several technologies (JavaScript, Google Maps API, Jade, etc...) and is currently hosted on Microsoft Azure. It scraps or mines so to speak several organizations websites to find the location data that we need. This data is then compunded and ordered so the user can see which locations are the closest to him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One obvious challenge is that there are way too many organizations that we would have to include in our data scrapping for everything to be accurate. So an automatic intelligent implementation is what is required for us to achieve that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great learning experience for all of us. We all started not knowing a lot of the stack we used and definitely got better over the weekend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal is to make sure the website is a great discovery tool for new non profits.
