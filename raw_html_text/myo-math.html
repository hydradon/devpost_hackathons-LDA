                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent 30 of our 36 hours crashing a drone before we decided to get our act together and win this whole Hackathon. The idea was first proposed thanks to one of our group members taking a service learning course where they learned about learning styles.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Myo Math asks you to do basic math problems and you answer them with your arm. You spell the number out in the air while wearing a Myo writstband and the app tells you if you're right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to implement the program and read the Myo's gestures and spatial data. We then take a snapshot of your movement and send it to tesseract ocr to interpret your image and check you answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drones are hard. Also so is spherical coordinates but we figured those out.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing something in six hours with half of the team asleep for most of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming is hard.
