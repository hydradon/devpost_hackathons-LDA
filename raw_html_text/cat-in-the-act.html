                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disciplining an animal requires consistent correction of negative behaviors. Cat in the act ensures that your feline is following the rules even when you are out of the house.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cat in the act uses a PIR sensor to activate a web cam that is being ran off of Undoo. Once activated the web cam will take a snap shot of its environment. The snapshot will be compared against other cat image through the use of . If the camera does detect a cat it will emit a tone to drive it away from ever surface you choose.
