                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are interconnected now more than ever. With the technological advancements in transportation, the increase of travel to other countries, and social media, people interact with people of all sorts of backgrounds--including people who speak different languages. The purpose of this app is to allow people to form friendships without having to deal with language barriers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This messaging app allows users to select the language they wish to use when messaging another user. If the two users have selected different languages, the app will automatically translate to each user's specified language. For example, if Person A has selected English, and Person B has selected Chinese, when Person A sends a message in English to Person B, Person B receives the message in Chinese.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build this app. Our team of three drew wire frames for the user interfaces first. Then, we divided the tasks, so one member focused on creating user accounts, another focused on adding friends, and the third member focused on the chat message system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to translate the messages, we had to use an API. We initially thought to use Google's API, but it isn't free. So, we found another translation site that offers free use of their API. Another challenge was that one team member was unable to come, and another team member had to leave early, so only two team members were working on the bulk of the app. We tried to limit the amount of unnecessary features to save time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got this far with the app in only one day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about email and phone number verification, using FireBase to store data, and using translation APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LangChat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think an additional feature in which users can speak in one language and have the app speak in another language would also be useful!
