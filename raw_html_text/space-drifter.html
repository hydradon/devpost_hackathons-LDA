                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a simple, but unique game that was different to the ones currently on the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is about you controlling a car with simple and intuitive left and right controls. You will be going around a globe and dodging incoming projectiles and trees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Unity and C#. The 3D models were created in Autodesk 3ds Max.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we faced was the physics and circular gravity of the globe. The gravity isn't just going down on the y axis, but towards the center of the globe. Getting the logic of this was difficult but we were able to do it. Another problem was also having incoming projectiles at the planet and the controls to be smooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of accomplishing this game as it is much better and more sophisticated than we thought it would end out to be. The overall product still needs some tweaking, but it is still a decent product from one day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Unity and C# and being able to solve difficult problems.
                </p>

                    What's next for Space Drifter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue on the project and fine tune it to ultimately release it on the app store and google play store.
