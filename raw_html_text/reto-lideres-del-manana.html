                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us in the team, it was the first time doing a hackathon. We didn't had much of an idea on what to do, but one of the challenges that they've given as an optional task was to develop anything that would help fund our school's campaign "Lideres de Ma&ntilde;ana". From there, we began to develop a way to be able to get funds from students for the school campaign.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, it's a mobile application (on Android) where the students in our school would be able to pay for subscriptions of school services available within the campus, such as ordering food in advance or reserving a book from the library. These funds would be donated towards the campaign.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform we used was Android Studio, accompained by a few Java templates. XML format was used to create the UI of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly, having little experience was an obstacle we had to face. We began to try learning to work in a collaborative manner through GitHub. for example. But other problems include bugs in the IDE that got in the way, as well as the limited knowledge we had with the programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to finally finish a prototype version of the app is definitely something we're proud of. This is all a sort of uncharted territory for all of us and being able to cross that territory is definitely something we felt good about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That programming is tough. We knew it's something hard to learn and harder to implement efficiently; but developing a work like this was a hard task to face, especially in the time limit we face. This experience can be a huge help in later projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RETO L&iacute;deres del ma&ntilde;ana
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add in new features and subscriptions options to be able to have more ways to fund our school campaign. Methods like raffles or notifications for events can help us get the word out &amp; be able to raise more funds. Hopefully this can help send the message to the students in the campus.
