                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual tracking is very common, and can be disastrous to the lives of people tracked by it. The knowledge of your network of communications is enough for third parties to make assumptions of your personality, often to your detriment. We wanted to prevent this form of tracking, and thus created Starmixer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starmixer is a cryptocurrency tumbler for Stellar, shuffling your Lumens with other peoples' to allow you to make more private transactions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Starmixer in a Node.js backend, using the Yates Fisher algorithm to randomly shuffle wallets. We  implemented a Keybase chatbot to deliver a client-friendly experience as they use the program. Additionally, we created a landing page for users to showcase the bot, and route them to the keybase site where they can find more information.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our team's varying skill levels, we originally encountered difficulty assigning work to most efficiently organize our team's time. However, by the end of the hackathon, we had managed to split the project into modules so each and every team member had a chunk of code that they could be proud to call their own.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the hackathon, our team had a completely different idea on what to do. We worked and we struggled, till we realized that the idea that we were striving for was quite simply impossible. We changed tack remarkably fast, managing to get on track with perfect time to complete our new project.
We are also proud of all the new skills we were able to acquire throughout the hackathon, even if we weren't able to use all of them for our final product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout Citizen Hacks, some of our team members were introduced to git's command line interface for the first time, learning lots about the internals of Git. We also learned about various tactics for improving internet privacy and how to use vim through the workshops that were hosted here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Starmixer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Starmixer would be to streamline the client experience so that this can be a default security for all users and be easily added to every transaction.
