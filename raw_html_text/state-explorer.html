                        My two grandchildren!  Even though the eldest is only 4, I want her and her brother to always enjoy learning as well as learn how to make a game out of learning.

                        It helps kids learn some basic facts about the states of the United States in a fun &amp; engaging way.

                    How I built it -

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        I used JavaScript and DynamoDB.
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Sometimes DynamoDB can act up.  Since I learned JavaScript &amp; DynamoDB over the past year on my own, I have run into more than enough snags, but persistence seems to pay off.  Sometimes I think I found "undocumented features" along the way.  Compared to writing the code, two of the hardest parts were creating the Skill Icon and editing the YouTube video.

                        Getting this done so I can use it as an example to my grand kids that there is nothing you can't accomplish with some hard work, determination and a little luck.

                        Some of the quirks of JavaScript &amp; DynamoDB.  More importantly, that I need to take a course or two, rather than exclusively rely on learning by doing!
