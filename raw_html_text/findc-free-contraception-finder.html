                <p>
                    For our project, we chose to explore access to free or discounted contraceptives, which are not always easy to find. Some people seeking this information may just not live in a place where that information is accessible to them through word of mouth.

                    Why is it a problem?

                <p>
                    According to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, contraceptive usage likely prevents over 272,000 maternal deaths a year. (

                    </a>
                    ). Contraceptive usage has been significantly linked to better quality of life for women (

                    ). Along with that, it advances the economy for everyone (

                    </a>
                    ). The fact that access to these resources is limited is a problem.

                    Our application has many features that set it apart from other applications:

                <p>
                    We aim to add a form of social media aspect to it in the form of the upvotes and downvotes. This system may attract more people to it, and it can be expanded upon in the future. We also chose to make the application a website rather than a React Native application because we knew it would be a one use sort of application, and young adults would not want to keep this app on their phone.

                <p>
                    Our application is built to be reliable and fast. We specifically used React code splitting to make the file sizes all under 200KB. This means that the application not only downloads fast from the cloud, but the JavaScript gets parsed quickly on lower end mobile devices. Many individuals in rural areas will benefit from this because their network may not be reliable, and their phones may be lower end.

                    Design-wise, the application is very simple. When you get to the home screen, you can click on a button to travel to a map. Then, you can simply move around and look for a place nearby, or you can search for a place. The simplicity will allow for non tech savvy individuals to use the app easily and reliably.

                    Ethical Concerns

                <p>
                    There are ethical concerns to keep in mind when making this application. In states where the general public is against contraception, it can be pressured into shutting down. To attempt to counteract this, we planned a button for petitioning the selection, where people who trust the selected place would be able to sign an anonymous petition to keep it running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with this, some small town shops who do this may not want to give out the location on such a wide scale application. We plan to implement a &lsquo;report&rsquo; button that will allow the place to set up a blackout area so they don&rsquo;t appear on the map.
