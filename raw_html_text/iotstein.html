                <p>
                    In modern days, IoT is the solution to almost anything, it can also be applied to everything and actually already is everywhere. To go beyond usual implementations of this concept, this project aims to apply the IoTization to the most simple and virtuous tool of all of mankind: the stone.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being an allrounder, it was important for the project to develop a deeply functional IoT device. Inspired by its historic usage, the interface was being kept as simple as possible though. Thus there are too many functions than can be possibly listed in this small introductionary text. Among them are everyday use cases like opening bottles and nuts as well as potential life savers like hailing a taxi (without any connectivity) or unlocking cars and doors when the key has been lost.
