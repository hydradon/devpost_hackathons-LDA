                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people can experience heart problems, especially elderly people. Usually problems come eventually without any warning, however modern technology is capable of helping them! Simply measuring the heart rate of the person it is possible to determine the problem few minutes before the disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heart Rate Monitor uses webcam to check the pulse of the human using face recognition. The program tries to find the face of a human. When it succeeds it selects the forehead and lower half of the face. Next program uses RGB separation, RGB component calculation, colour average matrix preprocessing, independent component analysis and signal filtering to find the pulse of the human. If the human moves away from the center of the camera, the camera tries to rotate to catch the face of the human and measure the heart rate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used the papers published by Qi Zhangab, Qingtian Wub, Yimin Zhoub, Xinyu Wub, Yongsheng Oub and Huazhang Zhouc "Webcam-based, non-contact, real-time measurement for the physiological parameters of drivers" to create our tool. Although the algorithms were described, the actual recreation of them was challenging. The arduino was programmed to control the servo-motors rotating the camera on it's stand, helping to track the human's face. The stand was partly 3D-printed and partly manufactured from the scrap components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first few hours were spent on creating the same project using C# code, however it soon became clear that MATLAB would suit much better for such type of projects.
The recreation of algorithms was a very challenging task. THe advanced MATLAB level was required to create such a complex tool. The usage of different technologies: arduino and MATLAB. Some problems with web-cams we were using caused us several hours to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skills of image processing and MATLAB are the main accomplishments of our project. Both image processing and MATLAB were previously introduced by professors at the University, however it was the first time we managed to accomplish such a complex task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project helped us to understand lots of different concepts about image recognition. The hours spent reading through MATLAB manuals and documentations helped us to get the new level in understanding MATLAB. Finally the designing and manufacturing the camera stand taught us a lot about 3D printing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Webcam Heart Rate Monitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The further advancements may include proper designed camera stand with 3-axis freedom. The computing speed might also be improved by refactoring the code and rewriting some of the algorithms. In future the system may send the warning signals or call an emergency for people if their live is threatened.
