                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the toughest jobs in the world is being a parent. We often get caught up in the chaos, that we forget to remember what's important. We forget to take note of the things that happen around us. We forget to celebrate the accomplishments of our little ones and we forget to take care of ourselves. Therefore we bring you ParentABLE, abling everyone to be a genius at parenting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ParentABLE is a mobile application that allows for people to master at being an efficient parent. The app is the one stop destination for all a parent's needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of all the little successes your children go through. Pictures and accomplishments are stored in our database. There is also a gallery for the collection of personal pictures that families collect over time.  When the parent needs some alone time from their child, there is a children's distractions feature which plays popular children's cartoons from Youtube. Also for a "pick me up", ParentABLE provides a bit of comic relief for the parent, with our collection of parental memes. Once enough time has passed, the app will be able to "throwback" to the past and bring up anniversaries from little memories, such as a year ago from today, your child took his first step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a parent is more than a full time job, it's a job that never stops. However parents are the most underappreciated in society. This app helps to relieve them of some of the burden and encourages them to enjoy their time with their family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ParentABLE was built on AndroidStudio. All of the features were built within androidstudio and we implemented the Youtube API for our distractions section. We started off with a blank app, and we built the java and xml files slowly from nothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was making the app relevant to as many people as possible. We wanted an app that would be useful and that takes the burden off for hard working parents.  At first we had the idea of making the app targeted to mothers only, but we quickly realized that was very limiting and unfair to all the fathers in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also difficult to work with fragments. Having only experienced working with activities, fragments were a built difficult to manipulate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the concept of the app. We're delving into an area that not many apps are focused on. There is not much in the app world that pertains to helping parents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new features from Android Studio. This was our first time implementing the navigating drawer, fragments and APIs. We also learned its important to make apps and project as relevant to as many people as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParentABLE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many things that we would like to implement for ParentABLE. We would like to grow a database and work on storing all of the information to a secure location. We also would like to work on the "throwback" feature where accomplishments and tasks from years ago would pop up on the app.
