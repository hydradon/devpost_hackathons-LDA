                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that could help people make decisions based off their fitness data to make better transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Queries the users purchase history and looks at fitness data to see the correlation between the two sets of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the actual app, and used Capital One's API to get simulated transaction history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio wasn't installed on 3 team members' computers which delayed development. During the project we encountered multiple bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to call the API and populate a table with the data that it returns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have a plan of what you want to develop starting out. Keep it simple because there are going to be bugs. Make sure your team has all the tools they need to be successful. Ask for help early on.
                </p>

                    What's next for FitTransactions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working to integrate actual fitness data using Android wearables as the data is currently simulated.
