                <p>
                    In a world where information is quickly accessed and easy to come by, it has also become increasingly easy to become misinformed. People have begun to trust websites that, on the surface, seem unbiased and trustworthy, and as a result, form misguided views on social issues such as sex and gender, race and ethnicity, and health issues, which can have consequences. To tackle this issue, my team and I decided to focus on the top issues we have seen controversy over and put all the related misconceptions in one place. After doing thorough research, we created a deck of cards for each topic, and when the user hovers over a card on the website or clicks on a card on the app, they can learn what the reality of the matter is. We hope you have fun and learn something new in our

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose three topics;
                    <strong>
                        Sex Education, Race and Ethnicity, and Health
                    </strong>
                    . We found that these three topics have many misconceptions surrounding them. We chose 6 different misconceptions for each and created cards for those, but there are many, many, more myths. In our website, there are tabs for each of the social issues, and in each page, we have created 6 cards with a misconception on one side and the reality on the other. Similarly, on the app, there are three tabs with each issue and 6 cards that you can scroll through and click on to find out the truth about common myths.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website using
                    <strong>
                        HTML
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        CSS
                    </strong>
                    and an iOS app using
                    <strong>
                        Swift
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Xcode
                    </strong>
                    .

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble formatting and starting out a layout in Xcode, but through research using online resources, we managed to figure it out. In addition, we had trouble figuring out how to flip the cards on the website using CSS so that the current information would appear on each side in the correct format. After digging through online documentation, we figured out how to do this using 3D transformations.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of how much we were able to accomplish despite not knowing all that much about these tools to begin. We all had a basic idea of these languages and tools, but we worked really hard and read through a lot of documentation to actually understand what we needed to do to add all the different functionalities we desired.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to think quickly and adapt to problems that came up in coding. We learned a lot about using Xcode and CSS, and we will be able to apply our knowledge in future projects.

                <p>
                    Using the foundation we built in this project, we plan to create a game in the format of 1 truth and 2 lies in order to test people's knowledge on the these common misconceptions. The idea is that people will educate themselves using the decks we already created, and then we will have another page with the game on it, where the user will be able to interact with 3 cards, choose which on has the "truth" on it, and gain points for each correct answer. We want to turn this into an interactive game where multiple users can play against each other, all the while educating themselves on these important issues. In addition, we want to turn this into a multi-disciplinary project where other students in different disciplines, such as Public Health, can do more research on the most important issues to focus on in our platform so that we provide the most accurate and unbiased content. In addition, we plan to play with more graphic design elements in order to make our project appealing to younger audiences once we turn it into a game.
