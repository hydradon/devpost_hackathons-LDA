                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team first was chatting with one another to come up with ideas. After seeing that we all liked Minecraft, we decided to create something relating to the game. Due to two of us having hardware components for Arduino, we choose to make something hardware related, and through some joking around we came up with the idea of DAVE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DAVE is a hardware device that is linked up to your PC. On the device, the user can press the buttons and it would adjust the time on the display. After pressing go, the timer would count down, and after reaching zero the device would produce an annoying sound. In addition to the sound, the device would also close all Java-related programs, as Minecraft is made using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the hardware for DAVE with Arduino, as well the timer for. Afterward, we made an algorithm from Python that would close all the games that the user would be playing and then spamming them with pop-ups as a reminder to study.
Finally, we created a webpage from HTML5, CSS, and javascript. The goal of the webpage is for people to be convinced of why DAVE is a good product, and it also acts as a way to mark the progress we made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges that we encounter and they both were related to Arduino. The first one was the problem of the hardware, as the buttons weren't working. This was solved after looking carefully and realizing that the buttons didn't have a GND. The other problem was the transferring of data from Arduino to Python. After sending much time figuring out pyserial, we are finally able to send data from one language to another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thing that we were most proud of was the sending of data from Arduino to Python. This took us the most amount of time, as we had to still up all night trying to figure it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we had learned was how to sent data between Arduino and Python, by using pysperial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project DAVE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time we want to make DAVE work for all OS platforms, as in the pysperial there apart for the port, but we used the port COM3 and that only works for window OS.
