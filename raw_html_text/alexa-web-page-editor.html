                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon's Echo is a smart speaker that acts as an at-home virtual assistant. Echo will answer your questions and follow your commands if it they are within Echo's capabilities. You can ask Echo to read you information about certain topics or current events, to add an item to your shopping cart, or a song to a playlist. Manipulating the purpose of Echo can allows users to create an easier method of editing their websites without utilizing a computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python, we created a program that will edit html files. We added the Python file as an Echo skill so it allows the user to add (append) or change code on their website. The Echo then takes the user's response as input, and edits the html web page accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Cloud Platform, we created a Virtual Machine containing Linux Ubuntu to run Python and test files. We then integrated our Python code into the Amazon Alexa's skill to test how it would work with Alexa's factory programming.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no prior experience with a Hack-a-thon, our team had originally struggled to establish a feasible idea that would be fully accomplished within the given time constraint. While executing our code, we faced the challenge of integrating between Python and HTML5.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were able to incorporate each of our skill sets into specific components of the project. We optimized the capabilities of our project through effective organization and management of our time.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaborating with other teams and within our team, we learned how to use Python, Echo Skill, a soldering iron, and how to integrate between HTML/CSS and Python, as well as how to utilize Google Cloud SSH.
