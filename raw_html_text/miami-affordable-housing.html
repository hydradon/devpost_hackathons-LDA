                <p>
                    There's an affordable housing crisis here in Miami and most big cities in USA.
We are concerned residents of Miami Dade County and are urging leaders, all elected officials, developers, management/leasing companies and Miami Dade Public Housing Community Development to remove the barriers to entry for working families with household incomes between 35k to 45k( 60% to 80%).
                </p>

                    We created a platform and a chatbot which residents can access and guide them through the difficult process that is applying and finding affordable housing opportunities
