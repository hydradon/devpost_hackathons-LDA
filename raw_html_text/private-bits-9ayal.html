                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented an entire file system in user space in 24 hours (we came late). It works the same work your finder on your laptop works: it has files and lets you manipulate them the same way a file system would. With one key difference: the files are chunked and steganographically embedded into jpeg images which are uploaded to flickr for free storage space. The privacy is guaranteed by md5 hashes, and other forms of encryption, before they are stored, and the images that have the hidden messages in them are not visibly altered.
