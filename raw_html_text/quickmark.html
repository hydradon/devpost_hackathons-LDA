                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some instructors still prefer passing around a sheet of paper for attendence while others like to call out names. This approach is not only time consuming but inconvenient form both the professor's and the students' end. We are simply employing web technology to digitalize the attendance system.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuickMark is a smart attendance system that is primarily targetted for university classes. It will not only speed up the attendance process but also enable metrics collections based on students' arrival time. At this phase, while we are unable to completely avoid human surveillance for this process, we still have a more efficient solution. The instructors will generate the valid attendance codes from their login portal and show them to the students as they enter the classroom. A new code is only generated and given a student when the instructor physically confronts the student which is when the student enters the classroom. Entering an invalid attendance code will not only cause an error but also detect who is trying to bypass the attendance without being present on that class. An easy solution could have been installing a hardware component, but doing so would require new resources. So, this application claims to provide a software-only solution with some involvement of the stakeholders of a class attendance process.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Being in CUHackit has been a fabulous experience so far. We are refining our understanding of the Computer Science domain by coming across several like-minded individuals from different institutions. We've been coding for more than 24 hours now, and this experience, although tiresome, was also rewarding when we finally got something working. If anything, this event certainly taught us patience and persistence, and also supplied us additional energy to keep learning in the future.
