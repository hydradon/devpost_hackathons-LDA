                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to play laser tag, but realized that the nearest arcade is way too far away? Now you can play with just your phones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use mobile phone technology to play with your friends in real life!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play one on one laser tag with your phones. You point your phone in selfie mode at someone else&rsquo;s phone and then hit the volume button to shoot. If you are aiming properly and you shoot, the other person should be knocked out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You only have one ammo slot at a time, and you have to point your phone at the other person&rsquo;s to reload.
                </p>

                    How to Play
                </h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Open app and click join game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type in username. You should be brought to a green screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let your opponent do the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stare your opponent straight in the eye, and start the game! You each start with 1 ammo (which is the max amount).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You play with the selfie camera pointed away from you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To shoot, press the volume button or tap the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To reload, point your screen at your opponents screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your selfie camera points directly at your opponent&rsquo;s screen, your phone should start vibrating, which indicates that you are locked on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you shoot when locked on, you hit your opponent and win! Everyone has one life. Be careful though&hellip; you can only hold one ammo at a time and you must expose yourself to reload.
                    </li>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a mobile android app in android studio and handled the backend with Firebase.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio can tough to work with, especially with all the SDKs we had to download, Gradle syncing, and its complex API. Firebase was also a new environment for all of us for real-time database. Two of our members had experience in Open CV, but they still learned more in-depth method required for better color recognition.
