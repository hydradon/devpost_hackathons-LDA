                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by online banking in general and trying to make sense of financial information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    FinancifyU provides insight about your financial data. Using Capital One's Nessie API, FinancifyU retrieves all sorts of financial data linked to you and put its in a nice format for viewing. This includes upcoming bills, recent withdrawals, and data visualizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a nice HTML template for our site. As the site was being developed, we also wrote Python code to handle Nessie requests. As both progressed, we used the Flask framework to tie everything together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues trying to host our site and trying to get all the pieces we wanted to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a nice looking site that we can demo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domain registration sucks and Python has a function for everything.
                </p>

                    What's next for FinancifyU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand our demo's functionality and add in a 2-Factor Authorization process (hopefully passwordless)!
