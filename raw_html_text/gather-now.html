                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When one of us was looking to plan meeting friends and party earlier this week, he came across the painstaking procedure of getting everyone to agree on a day, pick a place, etc etc. Life should be simpler! Automation can make it so!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gather.now is a one-touch application that allows a user to pick friends from his Facebook profile and then let the platform take care of the rest. The website picks a nearby restaurant and invites the other users, and even goes ahead and books their cab!
                </p>
