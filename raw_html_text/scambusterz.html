                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to build something to solve a real problem and increase safety in our society. A common experience for all of us was receiving scam calls but not knowing whether they should be answered and how to respond. So we decided to tackle this problem by building an Android App specifically to detect these calls and notify you before you give away important information.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    ScamBusters deals specifically with detecting/classifying a call as a scam and then gives you a series of responses that you can make to the scam caller. You no longer have to do nothing when you receive a scam call, you can respond with your own classic songs.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project with love using Android Studio, Java, Twilio and the WhitePages Phone Reputation API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all beginners to Android Studio, but had experience with Java. The biggest challenge was understanding how to interact with the Android System to access call log information, making API calls and outdated documentation.
