                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Few weeks back I was practicing meditation early in the morning. Though I was thoughtless at that point in time but back in my mind I was only thinking about Alexa skill that can help anyone to improve their health on day to day basis. I was only listening to relaxing sounds on my mobile. I was not aware of how I was breathing. But suddenly, word "Breathing" appears in from of me. and that was the inspiration for my Skill development.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First stage is "Learn". You first learn how to practice certain breathing exercises. Then you "Apply" it. Users can practice what they have learnt with relaxing sound. In this way, users get the most out of any particular breathing exercise. You pay more attention to your breathing when you meditating. That's why, this skill also contains Meditation section. Now, user may wonder why should they get out of their cozy bed to practice all of this. That is the reason why we have also included Breathing exercises and meditation benefits section where user gets idea about what is controlled breathing and what are the benefits of it. Why all of us should practice breathing exercises and meditation. So that is all about the objective of this skill.

                    What's next for Mindful breathing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next phase includes, new breathing exercises and different types of guided meditations. I am getting in touch with Yoga and meditation practitioners to get more idea on controlled breathing and guided meditation.  With help of the experts of their field, I am going to create new unique breathing exercises and meditation practices that users can benefit from. As this is my first attempt towards creating skill where Alexa gets more interactive with users and keeps track of breath counts, I am planning to spend some more time and do more research on Alexa  speech technology. Once campaign is over, my plan is to get in touch with few more like minded developers and build a team for future projects where we share our knowledge, nurture new ideas and research more and more and create mind blowing skills for users. In my opinion, College freshers would make a great team. Fresh thoughts, high on energy and best in class technology - Alexa. So if I get a chance I would pick college freshers and begin my startup journey.
