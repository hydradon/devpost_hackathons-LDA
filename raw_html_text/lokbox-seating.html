                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we've collectively noticed that airport seating has lacked updates that other aspects of aviation have experienced in recent years. There is an opportunity to provide a better product to travelers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design reduces the inconveniences of air travel, primarily flight delays. Features that accomplish this include, a reclining seats, temporary storage capabilities, and plentiful charging ports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D modeling software to conceive a preliminary design. See PowerPoint for many further details of the design process.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an original idea that would improve the air traveler experience, cost analysis, and dimensioning.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Final product is comprehensive and considers many design aspects in detail.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How total strangers can come together in a short period of time to design something useful.
