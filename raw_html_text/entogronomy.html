                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from Hanna who is an entomologist with close relations to farmers. She explained to us the problem farmers face with dealing with pests and services dealing with pest. Which led us to create our web app Entogronomy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enogronomy is a database which allows farmers to record encounters with pests creating content holding the name of the crop, pest also the option to pin the location and attach an image of pest or crop damage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web app using all the main stream web development tools(html, css, bootstrap, php) and a mysql database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran out of time to create a page with would query our database for instances of bug and crop encounters to display to farmers. We also ran out of time to create our map pinning service which was taking all the lat and long and creating a map displaying different pest encounters.(we were using R and Shiny to accomplish this)
On mobile we are running into a formatting error with the choose file button moving outside of the div when on small screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything the entire site took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. Highlights if we had to choose would be the UI of the site it took lots of tinkering to get it to look up to our standards. We are also proud of our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO MUCH a few of us are first years so the fact we even have something that we can demo feels amazing. We had a really good mentor helping us through with our database linking so we learned design and database.
                </p>
