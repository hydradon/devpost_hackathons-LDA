                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's face it.  Most students are broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically making money and being a student are at odds with one another.  Studying doesn't bring any money in and if you are working you aren't studying.  A+ makes making money and being a student one.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made an Android app for a front end and used Flask running on AWS in the backend.
I also integrated the Capital One Nessie API for payments
                </p>

                <p>
                    Too much sloppy code
                </p>

                    So much about Android, RESTFul APIs, and so much more
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'll have to think about it.  It definitely needs a polish!
