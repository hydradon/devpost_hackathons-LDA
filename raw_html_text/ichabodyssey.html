                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea comes from the theme of "conservation". Inside this game, the character has a head and a body. The two parts can be separated and recombined.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a 2D platformer game in which the player solve simple puzzles and pass levels by throwing and recollecting his head.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it upon some basic mechanics in this type of game. We have static obstacles and moving enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we had is implementing the animation of the moving enemies. By incorporating knowledge of equation of motion, we come up with a program that makes the enemies move smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game has a very good implicit guide. The mechanics are presented in a good order so that the player can understand the game mechanics without any instruction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use C# and how to use physics engine using C# and Unity.

                    What's next for IchabOdyssey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally each member of DTC will take the experience gained from working on IchabOdyssey together to develop stronger games on our own. Access to the source code will also allow all members to potentially make their own unique future levels for IchabOdyssey.
