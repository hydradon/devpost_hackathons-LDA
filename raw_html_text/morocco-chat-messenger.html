For instance if Driver needs  to ride with just female passengers or Male Passengers or Mixed(ie Both Male and Female), the 
Driver  can send a Message broadcast based on Gender Option selected so that Passengers that wants to travel will start accepting the
request in real-time...

                <p>
                    Consequently, If a Passenger want to ride with just Male or Female or Mixed (ie Both Male and Female), 
He/She can use the bidding system
to send notification broadcast, then Drivers looking for passenger can now contact him/her from Passengers Profile via
SMS Ride Request, Phone Call and Chat System....This Bidding System tends to reduce cost as many Drivers
will queue up trying to accept the passengers request, barging on Cost can go on eg. via Chatting, Phone Call etec...
