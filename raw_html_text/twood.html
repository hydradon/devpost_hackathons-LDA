                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to look at the United States in terms of happiness, and thought the platform that people express their emotions on most was twitter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes tweets based on a library of words from twitter and their connotations to positivity or negativity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Twitter API, we receive tweets and assign them either positive (10)  or negative (1) values
Each word from the tweets are then put into a pool, where it is then assigned a happiness value between 1 and 10 based on all of the tweets it was in (average sum of positive/negative)
When a tweet is to be analyzed, its happiness score is taken from the average of its component words, and the final output is put on a scale of 1 - 10 (1 - 5 being more negative, and 5 - 10 being more positive)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran out of time and had issues with streaming because of CORS, which meant that we weren't able to finish the end product, a map of the US with major cities displaying their average mood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using training data on a large scale to create artificial intelligence on a computer is a great feat to accomplish in 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That CORS messes projects up and you need lots of sample data for AI to be accurate.
