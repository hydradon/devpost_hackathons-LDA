                    After years of being ridiculed by friends due to your lack of pitch, lack of tone, and lack of singing self-esteem, we wanted to create an application where we could practice hitting the right notes before being pushed onto the main stage in front of all our peers. Thus, we created Hit The Notes, where given any YouTube link, a user can see the pitch required to impress your acquaintances.

                    Using React to build the user-facing component of the page, it is able to accept and parse a user's vocal input from a microphone. A Flask backend handles all the extra extraction and transformation of the YouTube video, and serves the notes to the webpage.
