                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most models provide no confidence measure for its predictions due to argmax().
Thats a problem if you want to compare the predictions for objects from different sensors (multimodalilty)
                </p>

                    <li>
                        we colored the images with a different intensity proportional to the output of the neuron (plotted logits)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        with a pre-build sotA model we predict the class of objects in images
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        with this classification we trained a separate convNN to predict errors in the classification.

                    <li>
                        core of challenge was already popular research area, so we found it hard to identify possible contributions for this scope
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        modifying the current state-of-the-art model-graph to include dropout for inference (in order to achieve dropout sampling for confidence estimation) proved a technological challenge
                    </li>

                    we learned to develop not perfect NN-models in short time.
