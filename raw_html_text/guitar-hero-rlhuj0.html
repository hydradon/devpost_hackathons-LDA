                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first ever hack so I just want to make something that sounds fun to me. I really like the physics and mechanism of digital audio so I decided to learn more about it in this BrickHack
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It mimics the sounds of an particular musical instrument, in this case, guitar.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I followed the instruction and many other videos. Instruction can be found here:

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know anything about Java before, so the biggest problem for me is figuring out how the code will work. In addition, the mechanism of digital audio (using Karplus-Strong algorithm) is hard for me at first.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, I make it works! Moreover, I have met and talked to amazing people and eat good food here at Brickhack!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Java from scratch and digital audio theory!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guitar Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will advance this project by modifying the algorithm to make it replicate other instruments such as harp, drum, piano. Also, I want it can play the whole song from users input (right now it just can play when user hits a key)
