                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we went back to graduate school after working professionally, we were excited to be surrounded by such amazing classmates but we were surprised by how infrequently candid feedback was shared between peers. We want to facilitate personal growth through the wisdom of one's classmates.

                <p>
                    Grow is a Slack chatbot that facilitates:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Giving and requesting structured, actionable feedback
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tracking progress over time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figuring out who to engage with
                    </li>

                        Determining when to give feedback
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using botkit.ai, a chatbot JavaScript framework, to integrate with Slack's APIs. We are hosting our API in Google Kubernetes Engine on top of Google Cloud Platform. All of our monitoring and alerting is through Stackdriver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feedback is hard. This is a complex human-centered design problem that is particularly poignant for knowledge workers in the tech space. There is a lot of opportunity for Grow to continue solving the questions of: who should I engage with, when should I engage, and how should I engage? During HackNYU we focused primarily on solving "when" through timely nudges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hopeful that the feedback exchanged as a result of these nudges increases the level of self-awareness of the hackathon attendees and will eventually lead to accelerated personal growth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to learn through user interviews and contextual inquiries that the lack of feedback is a big problem for many people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a more tactical note - our nudges were successful in getting people to engage! We think that the validation from this small experiment has opened the door for more work in this space in the future.
                </p>
