                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a platform that allowed us to quantify and visualize consumer opinions of companies in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    'Opiniorated' uses sentiment analysis of real-time tweets to score a company's favor-ability by giving it a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. Real-time opinion/sentiment analysis has the potential to give us another measure that could help us predict various trends 'ahead of time'. While there are a lot of numerical factors that are used to do the same thing, 'opiniorated' harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing to quantify various qualitative factors.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built 'opiniorated' using
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the Natural Language Processing API from the Google Cloud Platform to perform Sentiment Analysis,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the Twitter Standard Search API to mine real-time/recent tweets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        d3.js to make our visualization/UI
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The backend was programmed primarily in python and the front-end in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was figuring out how to do data/sentiment analysis in real time, since real-time analysis was harder to implement and also made us feel very uncertain about what to expect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing this hack, and can't wait to improve and build upon it!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the ML/NLP capabilities of the GCP, and also how to use the Twitter API.

                    What's next for OPINIORATED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build 'opiniorated' into an even more comprehensible platform
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        by implementing a consolidated scoring system that takes into account data from various other platform such as news outlets, reddit and so on
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        finding trends between the 'opiniorated' generated score and the stock-market value fluctuations for a particular company. So, we believe that this could turn into a very involved quant-project!
