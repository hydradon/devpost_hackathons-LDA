                    is a dual-interface app that let's you sign in as either a normal consumer or a verified walk-in clinic. As a consumer, the app locates the user using GPS location and
                    <em>
                        Google Places
                    </em>
                    is used to find walk-in clinics near you. The user can filter walk-in clinics by distance or city and then choose a convenient time for his/her appointment. All the clinics unfiltered by the user will receive a notification in their app of this request and the first clinic to accept the request will receive the consumer. Cancellations of appointments are available until 3 hours before the scheduled appointment. The consumer will pay a deposit fee of $5.00 that will be given back when they show up to the appointment on time. Walk-in-clinics will have to download the institutional version of the

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    First time building an app using android studios and the interface was very new to me. Ran into many compatibility problems as the code wasn't running with proper formatting. First time working with
                    <strong>
                        XML
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Java
                    </strong>
                    on a large scale project.

                    I learnt the basics of android studios as well as a new programming language, Java.

                <p>
                    To get approval ratings from Clinics and help them understand our goal. We have to make sure that a large sum of clinics are using the app so that the consumers will see the benefit of it and eventually become a user of the app. In the future, we hope this can be implemented in other health-care institutions such as hospitals, family doctors, and specialists.
