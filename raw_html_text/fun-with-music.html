                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My daughter and I love music and we thought the other kids should enjoy learning about the musical instruments too. And what better way to learn music than playing a musical game with an educational Alexal skill. That is how we came up with this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps kids to learn different musical instruments and how they sound. They can listen to different instruments and guess what it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill was developed using Java Alexa Skills Kit SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only challenge I ran into was to make all musical sounds into the proper format that Alexa accepts. It was an easy process after going through documentations.
