                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each feature that is built within this application is inspired by my experience at UCLA. Many of these functionalities are aimed to provide students with useful information at a click of a button. They are developed to enrich the experience that UCLA students get at college.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can use dining hall menu function get a clean and simple list of food items at various dining halls without having to go the dining hall webpage.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used android studio and many of its feature to create the application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was running into a lot of challenges with the Tabbed Activity, Fragment Save/Resume, and Navigation View. These features are used to enrich the user experience when they are using the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I was running into a lot of problems, I managed to get the menu display function to work, which I consider to be a huge accomplishment since this is the first time that I am working with the new Android Studio features to create this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from the technical knowledge, I also learn that perseverance is key. Regardless of the countless numbers of bugs in my program, I kept going and eventually got one of the four intended functions to work. Since Android Studio is continuously changing, many if not most of the video tutorials are outdated, and they are no longer accurate for the current versions. Nevertheless, I did not give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LAHacksDiningMenu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application is far from perfect. There are still three more features that I need to implement which are the hour of operation, swipe counter, and friend location. The hour of operation displays when food places at UCLA open and close. The swipe counter tells students how many swipes they should have left based on their meal plan and current date. The friend location shows the students where their friends are in the same dining hall. Although the name of the application is LAHacksDiningMenu, I intended to expand this application beyond this scope. I want to integrate classes notification function(which notifies students when a class is open), event function (which tells students what events are going on at UCLA), etc. I want to make it an integral part of every UCLA students and possible expand it to other university.
