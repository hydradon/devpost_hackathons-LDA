                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of international students, we struggled in learning English, as it is not our main language of communication. Hence, we decided to develop this app in order to assist fellow international students who face a similar difficulty like us, and allow them to have a better experience in learning the English language.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual Pets is a web app game with a digital pet genre that allows players/users to adopt their own personal pet, which they will feed and take care of, by feeding them new English words that they have learnt in their everyday life. Feeding it new words frequently will prevent it from getting hungry, and also allow the pet to gain experience/relationship points and 'level up', thus incorporating the idea of your own fantasy pet. Users can also play mini-games with their pets, which mainly involve games training your English vocabulary and skills.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated a dictionary API to display the meaning, usage and details of the words you 'fed' your pet, and also a translation API to create a feature that allows you to translate the words that you know in your native language, but not in the English language, using Node JS.

                    What's next for Virtual Pets
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the features in our Virtual Pets web app may seem really limited, we have considered a lot of other features too for implementation, such as an independent feature, where your pet can then 'hunt' for words itself when it reaches a certain level, instead of you always feeding it, and instead provide a mutual relationship with the user where the pet will also provide new vocabulary daily to the user after hunting. Other features we considered are the email notifications for when your pet is hungry/dying, a mobile app version of the game (in order to improve accessibility and ease of gameplay), and also a multiplayer fight system, where players can fight against each other in real time in a 'synonym battle'.
