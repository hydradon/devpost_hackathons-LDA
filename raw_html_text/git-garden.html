                <p>
                    Keep up your personal project commits by keeping your Git-Garden alive! This project renders your commit streaks on each of your individual projects
as small flowers that grow taller as your commit more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It includes a web-interface to render your garden in a pretty way as well as a CLI to check the status of a single local repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water your garden with those commits!
