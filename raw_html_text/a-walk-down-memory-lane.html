                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary inspiration was the workshop we participated in at the very beginning of the hackathon. Learning about some of the fashions of the 90s led to us wanting to look at other cultural icons from that decade. From that, we realized that we also wanted to explore other decades as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an informational website which takes cultural icons from different decades and provides it to the user. Primarily, at this point of our project, we show many entertainment features of these decades including top movies, songs, and sporting events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS and the platform Cloud9. Overall, we worked by dividing tasks among group members based on who had what type of capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble linking our different pages together. Buttons that were supposed to lead to other portions of the website, originally led to the same website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The landing page of our website is very aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, the buttons change as you hover over them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think a major part of what we learned is how to assign tasks to separate people. With a main lead developer who has the idea, we learned that it is best to give different tasks to different people based on their strengths. Also, we learned more of the different capabilities of html and css, especially through our usage of parallax and hovering options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Walk Down Memory Lane
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to expand the website to accommodate more decades. As well as that, it would be nice if we were able to give users more freedom and access to what they can see. Rather than showing the top few things, maybe it would be better if we could access an updating list from other data bases making our website much more integrated to the changing circumstances of society.
