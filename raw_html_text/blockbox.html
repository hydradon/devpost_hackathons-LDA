                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that would push the limits of blockchain technology. So we came up with a traffic system that would require a high throughput solution with near realtime functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A blockchain-based implementation makes sense for the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adversarial peer-to-peer context
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Localised operation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disintermediated time-stamping of events that would be a useful data source for insurance or crash investigation (blockchains are time-series state transition systems)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Traffic management has clear state-machine-like abstraction
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using the blockchain to make our roads and skies safer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self driving cars and robot drones are coming, and will introduce a systemic risk to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Smart Vehicle will track and measure various telemetry data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These would include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Proximity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Speeding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NoIndication
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        RedLight
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each vehicle will record safety events on the blockchain by interacting with a single global smart contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These events are sent to the Azure IoT hub, and can be connected to custom event handlers. In our demo we send an contract call that displays the location of the incident which can dispatch emergency services.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        We used the following technologies to implement our solution.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Our prototype uses the Ethereum blockchain and the Azure cloud platform.
