                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think it would be very convenient to be able to tour a potential home in virtual reality.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We compile still photos and turn them into a virtual reality tour for the user to view.

                    How we built it

                    We implemented Google Maps API and Azure to create our app.
