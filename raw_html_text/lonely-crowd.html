                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am attending an English classes and I noticed that my classmates doesn't know each other and behave asocially. I think that our app will help my classmates to socialize in our small community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our app the user can choose type of the event or the meetup by how many people participate in it.
If it is a large event like a hackathon, a socker match or a rave, the user can search by name of the event or by adress where the event will be taking place. Then if there is that exact event, we will show list of participants and the user can try to meet with one of them on the event.
Otherwise, if it is a small meetup, the administration of this meetup can create its group in our app, and spread information about it by short links or qr codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lets say that we are running some fitness club. We will create a group and print qr code or short link and hang it somewhere at the reception. Visitors will join this group and it will be easier for them to meet each other. Maybe they will have more motivation to keep visiting our gym.
