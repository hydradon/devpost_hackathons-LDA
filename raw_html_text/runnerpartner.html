                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both wanted to run more often, and noticed that it's much easier for us to commit to running if we join a group. But that can be pretty intimidating if your skill level/pace is much different than other runners, and very difficult if you have timing conflicts with local running groups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app lets you choose people that you think would be good running buddies. You see a small profile for people nearby, and get to choose/request to run with those that might be at your level or at a level you're trying to achieve. The app allows you to get to know each other over text before pairing you together.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    David focused on the Front-end, using Bootstrap, vanilla Javascript and JQuery. Bootstrap allowed us to easily create a responsive web app; Javascript gave us interactive elements; and JQuery made GET and POST requests a breeze. He also created the algorithm determining whether potential running partners were close enough to each other to be matched together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jarian focused on the Backend, using Flask, MySQLAlchemy, Twilio and Amazon EC2. Flask allowed fast prototyping of a complex backend that easily integrates with Ajax. MySQLAlchemy expedited the process of building a database and gave specialized functionality for working with Flask that made exporting to any database and maintaining it trivial. AWS is solid platform for keeping an app constantly running, giving us the power of open-ended Ubuntu Linux for our server.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have the time to implement every feature we wanted into the app.
Balancing testing with more functionality was a hard line to walk. We responded by shrinking the scope a bit,
but we thankfully did not have to shrink by much!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is fully functioning! No hard-coding on the client or server side! We built it to possibly be ready to launch the day of the hackathon, though we would likely take a week or so to polish the product.

                    We learned a different way to interface with Ajax
