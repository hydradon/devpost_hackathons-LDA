                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've talked about in class how cars pose a great threat to the urban fabric and how cities that have a focus on social capital have worked hard to bring down their car traffic and keep the number of lanes in their streets down as well. Our focus is to develop a system that reduces the congestion and stress that car traffic has on the infrastructure, through an automated car crash response system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system will be comprised of an array of sensors in the roadways at locations with high densities of car crashes. The sensors will listen for car crashes. When the sensor hears the car crash, it will send the information up to a server where GDOT employees can investigate these possible crashes through their camera system. If it is in fact a crash, an EMT team will be dispatched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the webapp portion using html, javascript, and the google maps api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to develop a mySQL server to grab data from but unfortunately ran out of time. Also because of that, some of the front-end functionality isn't perfect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the waypoints and map system that shows where the crashes are located.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of web development, where no one on the team had much experience at all in it we had to learn quickly.
                </p>

                    What's next for Car Crash Sensors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continued development of the web-app and then work on the actual sensors.
