                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    Our app shows restaurants near you and displays their level of eco-friendliness right on the map. The eco-friendliness data is crowdsourced from people who go to restaurants and leave reviews and take pictures showcasing the use of things like compostable bowls and cutlery.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end with HTML and CSS, the back end with flask for python, the maps with the Google Maps JavaScript API, and the logo and icons with Gravit Designer. We hosted the project on a VPS through AWS Lightsail and used Domain.com to get the greenspot.tech URL.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a small team and most of the technologies we used were new to us so we had to spend a lot of time debugging.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up the server and DNS settings correctly and it's running live at

                    . We also used the Google Maps API correctly and were able to customize the look of the maps and pins and create custom interactions with them.
