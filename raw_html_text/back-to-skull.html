                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a current Anatomy student the biggest struggle in my current class is having access to anatomy models. We only have access on Fridays for a limited amount of time. In the exam you are given anatomy models to label certain parts. The book at times makes it very hard to define small fissures or structures in the bone that a 3d model can. With emerging 3D modeling libraries in javascript we decided to build a 3d model of a skull to allow students to study at their own convenience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows students to explore and 3D anatomical models.  Students can learn specific bones by either clicking on buttons in the side panel or using voice commands to zoom into a selected part.  Fluid animations are conducted so that users can clearly and memorably see and learn the different bones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js to serve it in development, javascript for handling click/mouse interactions, voice recognition and voice response libraries for the voice user interface, three.js for loading and manipulating models, and the tween.js library for producing fluid animations for a smooth user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a substantial project despite our relative newness to graphics and the three.js library and voice user interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the three.js library, how to do animations, and how to add voice user interactions in a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Back to Skull
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more modules for even more parts of the human anatomy for more for students to learn and practice with.
